{"paragraph": "It is noteworthy that Miss Miller quotes another case, where a name suddenly obtruded itself, parallel to the emerging into consciousness of Chiwantopel, namely, A-ha-ma-ra-ma, with the feeling that it dealt with something Assyrian.[364] As a possible source of this, there occurred to her \u201cAsurabama, who made cuneiform bricks,\u201d[365] those imperishable documents made from clay: the monuments of the most ancient history. If it were not emphasized that the bricks are \u201ccuneiform,\u201d then it might mean ambiguously \u201cwedged-shaped bricks,\u201d which is more suggestive of our interpretation than that of the author.\u201cRemember when Moses said to his servant, \u2018I will not stop till I  reach the confluence of the two seas, or for eighty years will I  journey on.\u2019\u201cBut when they reached their confluence they forgot their fish, and it  took its way in the sea at will.\u201cAnd when they had passed on, Moses said to his servant, \u2018Bring us our  morning meal, for now we have incurred weariness from this our  journey.\u2019\u201cHe said, \u2018What thinkest thou? When we repaired to the rock for rest,  then verily I forgot the fish; and none but Satan made me forget it,  so as not to mention it; and it hath taken its way in the sea in a  wondrous sort.\u2019\u201cHe said, \u2018It is this we were in quest of.\u2019 So they both went back  retracing their footsteps.\u201cThen found they one of our servants to whom we had vouchsafed our  mercy, and whom we had instructed with our knowledge;[369]\u201cMoses said to him, \u2018Shall I follow thee that thou teach me, for  guidance of that which thou hast been taught?\u2019\u201cHe said, \u2018Verily, thou canst by no means have patience with me; and  how canst thou be patient in matters whose meaning thou comprehendest  not?\u2019\u201d\u2014Trans.
