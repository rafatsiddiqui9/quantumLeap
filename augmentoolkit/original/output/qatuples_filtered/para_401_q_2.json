    "paragraph": "It may be assumed most certainly that the domestication of humanity has cost the greatest sacrifices. An age which produced the stoical ideal must certainly have known why and against what it was created. The age of Nero serves to set off effectually the famous extracts from the forty-first letter of Seneca to Lucilius:\u201cOne drags the other into error, and how can we attain to salvation  when no one bids us halt, when all the world drives us in deeper?\u201d\u201cDo you ever come across a man unafraid in danger, untouched by  desires, happy in misfortune, peaceful in the midst of a storm,  elevated above ordinary mortals, on the same plane as the gods, does  not reverence seize you? Are you not compelled to say, \u2018Such an  exalted being is certainly something different from the miserable body  which he inhabits?\u2019 A divine strength rules there, such an excellent  mind, full of moderation, raised above all trivialities, which smiles  at that which we others fear or strive after: a heavenly power  animates such a person, a thing of this kind does not exist without  the co\u00f6peration of a deity. The largest part of such a being belongs  to the region from which he came. Just as the sun\u2019s rays touch the  earth in reality and yet are at home only there from whence they come,  so an eminent holy man associates with us. He is sent to us that we  may learn to know the divine better, and although with us, still  really belongs to his original home. He looks thither and reaches  towards it; among us he walks as an exalted being.\u201d",

    "question": "What analogy does Seneca use to describe the relationship between a Stoic idealist and the divine realm?",
    "answer": "Seneca uses the analogy of the sun\u2019s rays to describe the relationship between a Stoic idealist and the divine realm. He compares the sun\u2019s rays, which touch the earth but are at home only where they originate, to an eminent holy man who associates with us but truly belongs to his original home. This analogy suggests that the Stoic idealist is sent to us to help us learn about the divine, while still maintaining a connection to their divine origin.",
