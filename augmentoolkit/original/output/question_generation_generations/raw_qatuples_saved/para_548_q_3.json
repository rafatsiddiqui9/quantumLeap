No, let me die as I have lived in faith,        Nor quiver though the universe may quake!\u201dThe words are included in a kind of praise or prayer, spoken by a \u201cmortal\u201d who is in hopeless flight before the mounting deluge. Miss Miller puts herself in the same situation in her quotation; that is to say, she readily lets it be seen that her feeling is similar to the despondency of the unhappy ones who find themselves hard pressed by the threatening mounting waters of the deluge. With this the writer allows us a deep look into the dark abyss of her longing for the sun-hero. We see that her longing is in vain; she is a mortal, only for a short time borne upwards into the light by means of the highest longing, and then sinking to death, or, much more, urged upwards by the fear of death, like the people before the deluge, and in spite of the desperate conflict, irretrievably given over to destruction. This is a mood which recalls vividly the closing scene in \u201cCyrano de Bergerac\u201d:[190]_Cyrano_:Oh, mais ... puisqu\u2019elle est en chemin,     Je l\u2019attendrai debout ... et l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e \u00e0 la main.Que dites-vous?... C\u2019est inutile? Je le sais.     Mais on ne se bat pas dans l\u2019espoir du succ\u00e8s.     Non, non. C\u2019est bien plus beau lorsque c\u2019est inutile.Je sais bien qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin vous me mettrez \u00e0 bas....",
