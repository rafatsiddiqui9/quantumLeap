  "original_text": "The fundamental pictures are the sacrificial death and the resurrection\nof Christ, like the self-sacrifice of the sun, which voluntarily breaks\nits sceptre, the fructifying rays, in the certain hope of resurrection.\nThe following comments are to be noted in regard to “the sceptre of\nrays”: Spielrein’s patient says, “God pierces through the earth with his\nrays.” The earth, in the patient’s mind, has the meaning of woman. She\nalso comprehends the sunbeam in mythologic fashion as something solid:\n“Jesus Christ has shown me his love, by striking against the window with\na sunbeam.” Among other insane patients I have come across the same idea\nof the solid substance of the sunbeam. Here there is also a hint of the\nphallic nature of the instrument which is associated with the hero.\nThor’s hammer, which, cleaving the earth, penetrates deeply into it, may\nbe compared to the foot of Kaineus. The hammer is retained in the\ninterior of the earth, like the treasure, and, in the course of time, it\ngradually comes again to the surface (“the treasure blooms”), meaning\nthat it was born again from the earth. (Compare what has been said\nconcerning the etymology of “swelling.”) On many monuments Mithra holds\na peculiar object in his hands, which Cumont compares to a half-filled\ntube. Dieterich proves from his papyrus text that the object is the\nshoulder of the bull, the bear constellation. The shoulder has an\nindirect phallic meaning, for it is the part which is wanting in Pelops.\nPelops was slaughtered by his father, Tantalus, dismembered, and boiled\nin a kettle, to make a meal for the gods. Demeter had unsuspectingly\neaten the shoulder from this feast, when Zeus discovered the outrage. He\nhad the pieces thrown back into the kettle, and, with the help of the\nlife-dispensing Clotho, Pelops was regenerated, and the shoulder which\nwas missing was replaced by an ivory one. This substitution is a close\nparallel to the substitution of the missing phallus of Osiris. Mithra is\nrepresented in a special ceremony, holding the bull’s shoulder over Sol,\nhis son and vice-regent. This scene may be compared to a sort of\ndedication, or accolade (something like the ceremony of confirmation).\nThe blow of the hammer as a generating, fructifying, inspiring function\nis retained as a folk-custom and expressed by striking with the twig of\nlife, which has the significance of a charm of fertility. In the\nneuroses, the sexual meaning of castigation plays an important part, for\namong many children castigation may elicit a sexual orgasm. The ritual\nact of striking has the same significance of generating (fructifying),\nand is, indeed, merely a variant of the original phallic ceremonial. Of\nsimilar character to the bull’s shoulder is the cloven hoof of the\ndevil, to which a sexual meaning also appertains. The ass’s jawbone\nwielded by Samson has the same worth. In the Polynesian Maui myth the\njawbone, the weapon of the hero, is derived from the man-eating woman,\nMuriranga-whenua, whose body swells up enormously from lusting for human\nflesh (Frobenius). Hercules’ club is made from the wood of the maternal\nolive tree. Faust’s key also “knows the mothers.” The libido springs\nfrom the mother, and with this weapon alone can man overcome death.\n\nIt corresponds to the phallic nature of the ass’s jawbone, that at the\nplace where Samson threw it God caused a spring to gush forth[800]\n(springs from the horse’s tread, footsteps, horse’s hoof). To this\nrelation of meanings belongs the magic wand, the sceptre in general.\nΣκῆτρον belongs to σκᾶπος, σκηπάνων, σκήπων = staff; σκηπτός =\nstormwind; Latin _scapus_ = shaft, stock, scapula, shoulder; Old High\nGerman _Scaft_ = spear, lance.[801] We meet once more in this\ncompilation those connections which are already well known to us:\nSun-phallus as tube of the winds, lance and shoulder-blade.\n\nThe passage from Asia through Patmos to the Christian mysteries in the\npoem of Hölderlin is apparently a superficial connection, but in reality\na very ingenious train of thought; namely, the entrance into death and\nthe land beyond as a self-sacrifice of the hero, for the attainment of\nimmortality. At this time, when the sun has set, when love is apparently\ndead, man awaits in mysterious joy the renewal of all life:\n\n               “... And Joy it was\n               From now on\n               To live in the loving night and see\n               The eyes of innocence hold the unchanging\n               Depths of all wisdom.”\n\nWisdom dwells in the depths, the wisdom of the mother: being one with\nit, insight is obtained into the meaning of deeper things, into all the\ndeposits of primitive times, the strata of which have been preserved in\nthe soul. Hölderlin, in his diseased ecstasy, feels once more the\ngreatness of the things seen, but he does not care to bring up to the\nlight of day that which he had found in the depths—in this he differs\nfrom Faust.\n\n              “And it is not an evil, if a few\n              Are lost and never found, and if the speech\n              Conceals the living sound;\n              Because each godly work resembles ours;\n              And yet the Highest does not plan it all—\n              The great pit bears two irons,\n              And the glowing lava of Aetna....\n              Would I had the power\n              To build an image and see the Spirit—\n              See it as it was!”\n\nHe allows only one hope to glimmer through, formed in scanty words:\n\n              “He wakes the dead;\n              They who are not enchained and bound,\n              They who are not unwrought.\n              ... And if the Heavenly Ones\n              Now, as I believe, love me—\n              ... Silent is his sign[802]\n              In the dusky sky. And one stands under it\n              His whole life long—for Christ still lives.”\n\nBut, as once Gilgamesh, bringing back the magic herb from the west land,\nwas robbed of his treasure by the demon serpent, so does Hölderlin’s\npoem die away in a painful lament, which betrays to us that no\nvictorious resurrection will follow his descent to the shadows:\n\n               “... Ignominiously\n               A power tears our heart away,\n               For sacrifices the heavenly ones demand.”\n\nThis recognition, that man must sacrifice the retrogressive longing (the\nincestuous libido) before the “heavenly ones” tear away the sacrifice,\nand at the same time the entire libido, came too late to the poet.\nTherefore, I take it to be a wise counsel which the unconscious gives\nour author, to sacrifice the infantile hero. This sacrifice is best\naccomplished, as is shown by the most obvious meaning, through a\ncomplete devotion to life, in which all the libido unconsciously bound\nup in familial bonds, must be brought outside into human contact. For it\nis necessary for the well-being of the adult individual, who in his\nchildhood was merely an atom revolving in a rotary system, to become\nhimself the centre of a new system. That such a step implies the\nsolution or, at least, the energetic treatment of the individual sexual\nproblem is obvious, for unless this is done the unemployed libido will\ninexorably remain fixed in the incestuous bond, and will prevent\nindividual freedom in essential matters. Let us keep in mind that\nChrist’s teaching separates man from his family without consideration,\nand in the talk with Nicodemus we saw the specific endeavor of Christ to\nprocure activation of the incest libido. Both tendencies serve the same\ngoal—the liberation of man; the Jew from his extraordinary fixation to\nthe family, which does not imply higher development, but greater\nweakness and more uncontrolled incestuous feeling, produced the\ncompensation of the compulsory ceremonial of the cult and the religious\nfear of the incomprehensible Jehovah. When man, terrified by no laws and\nno furious fanatics or prophets, allows his incestuous libido full play,\nand does not liberate it for higher purposes, then he is under the\ninfluence of unconscious compulsion. For compulsion is the unconscious\nwish. (Freud.) He is under the dominance of the libido εἱμαρμένη[803]\nand his destiny does not lie in his own hands; his adventures, Τύχαι καὶ\nΜοῖραι,[804] fall from the stars. His unconscious incestuous libido,\nwhich thus is applied in its most primitive form, fixes the man, as\nregards his love type, in a corresponding primitive stage, the stage of\nungovernableness and surrender to the emotions. Such was the psychologic\nsituation of the passing antiquity, and the Redeemer and Physician of\nthat time was he who endeavored to educate man to the sublimation of the\nincestuous libido.[805] The destruction of slavery was the necessary\ncondition of that sublimation, for antiquity had not yet recognized the\nduty of work and work as a duty, as a social need of fundamental\nimportance. Slave labor was compulsory work, the counterpart of the\nequally disastrous compulsion of the libido of the privileged. It was\nonly the obligation of the individual to work which made possible in the\nlong run that regular “drainage” of the unconscious, which was inundated\nby the continual regression of the libido. Indolence is the beginning of\nall vice, because in a condition of slothful dreaming the libido has\nabundant opportunity for sinking into itself, in order to create\ncompulsory obligations by means of regressively reanimated incestuous\nbonds. The best liberation is through _regular work_.[806] Work,\nhowever, is salvation only when it is a free act, and has in itself\nnothing of infantile compulsion. In this respect, religious ceremony\nappears in a high degree as organized inactivity, and at the same time\nas the forerunner of modern work.\n\nMiss Miller’s vision treats the problem of the sacrifice of the\ninfantile longing, in the first place, as an individual problem, but if\nwe cast a glance at the form of this presentation, then we will become\naware that here it must concern something, which is also a problem of\nhumanity in general. For the symbols employed, the serpent which killed\nthe horse[807] and the hero voluntarily sacrificing himself, are\nprimitive figures of phantasies and religious myths streaming up from\nthe unconscious.\n\nIn so far as the world and all within it is, above all, a thought, which\nis credited with transcendental “substance” through the empirical need\nof the same, there results from the sacrifice of the regressive libido\nthe creation of the world; and, psychologically speaking, the world in\ngeneral. For him who looks backward the world, and even the infinite\nstarry sky, is the mother[808] who bends over and encloses him on all\nsides, and from the renunciation of this idea and from the longing for\nthis idea arises the image of the world. From this most simple\nfundamental thought, which perhaps appears strange to us only because it\nis conceived according to the _principle of desire and not the principle\nof reality_,[809] results the significance of the cosmic sacrifice. A\ngood example of this is the slaying of the Babylonian primitive mother\nTiâmat, the dragon, whose body is destined to form the heaven and the\nearth. We come upon this thought in its most complete form in Hindoo\nphilosophy of the most ancient date; namely, in songs of Rigveda. In\nRigveda 10: 81, 4, the song inquires:\n\n “What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they\n    fashioned out the earth and heaven?\n Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit, whereon he stood when he\n    established all things.”\n\nViçvakarman, the All-Creator, who created the world from the unknown\ntree, did so as follows:\n\n          “He who, sacrificing, entered into all these beings\n          As a wise sacrificer, our Father, who,\n          Striving for blessings through prayer,\n          Hiding his origin,\n          Entered this lowly world,\n          What and who has served him\n          As a resting-place and a support?”[810]\n\nRigveda 10: 90, gives answer to these questions. Purusha is the primal\nbeing who\n\n                  “... covered earth on every side and\n                  Spread ten fingers’ breadth beyond.”\n\nOne sees that Purusha is a sort of Platonic world soul, who surrounds\nthe world from without. Of Purusha it is said:\n\n                  “Being born he overtopped the earth\n                  Before, behind, and in all places.”\n\nThe mother symbolism is plain, it seems to me, in the idea of Purusha.\nHe represents the mother-imago and the libido of the child clinging to\nher. From this assumption all that follows is very easily explained:\n\n               “As sacrificial animal on the bed of straw\n               Was dedicated the Purusha,\n               Who was born on the straw,\n               Whom the Gods, the Blest, and the Wise,\n               Meeting there, sacrificed.”",
