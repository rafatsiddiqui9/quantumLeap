    "paragraph": "It is not too much to say that we have herewith dug up the erotic root, and yet the problem remains unsolved. Were there not bound up with that a mysterious purpose, probably of the greatest biological meaning, then certainly twenty centuries would not have yearned for it with such intense longing. Doubtless, this sort of libidian current moves in the same direction as, taken in the widest sense, did that ecstatic ideal of the Middle Ages and of the ancient mystery cults, one of which became the later Christianity. There is to be seen biologically in this ideal an exercise of psychologic projection (of the paranoidian mechanism, as Freud would express it).[83] The projection consists in the repressing of the conflict into the unconscious and the setting forth of the repressed contents into seeming objectivity, which is also the formula of paranoia. The repression serves, as is well known, for the freeing from a painful complex from which one must escape by all means because its compelling and oppressing power is feared. The repression can lead to an apparent complete suppression which corresponds to a strong self-control. Unfortunately, however, self-control has limits which are only too narrowly drawn. Closer observation of people shows, it is true, that calm is maintained at the critical moment, but certain results occur which fall into two categories._First_, the suppressed effect comes to the surface immediately afterwards; seldom directly, it is true, but ordinarily in the form of a displacement to another object (e. g. a person is, in official relations, polite, submissive, patient, and so on, and turns his whole anger loose upon his wife or his subordinates).",

    "question": "What are the two categories of results that occur due to the suppression of the effect mentioned in the text?",
    "answer": "The two categories of results that occur due to the suppression of the effect are:\n\n1. **Immediate Surface Appearance:** The suppressed effect comes to the surface immediately afterwards, but not directly. It typically manifests as a displacement to another object. For example, a person who is polite and submissive in official relations may turn their anger and frustration on their wife or subordinates.\n\n2. **Delayed Surface Appearance:** The suppressed effect is not always directly expressed but often manifests in a delayed manner, where the repressed emotions or conflicts are redirected towards other objects or situations.",
