    "paragraph": "This is not torment which comes from without, which befalls mankind; but that he himself is the hunter, murderer, sacrificer and sacrificial knife is shown us in another of Nietzsche\u2019s poems, wherein the apparent dualism is transformed into the soul conflict through the use of the same symbolism:\u201cOh, Zarathustra,         Most cruel Nimrod!         Whilom hunter of God         The snare of all virtue,         An arrow of evil!         Now         Hunted by thyself         Thine own prey         Pierced through thyself,         Now         Alone with thee         Twofold in thine own knowledge         Mid a hundred mirrors         False to thyself,         Mid a hundred memories         Uncertain         Ailing with each wound         Shivering with each frost         Caught in thine own snares,         Self knower!         Self hangman!\u201cWhy didst thou strangle thyself         With the noose of thy wisdom?         Why hast thou enticed thyself         Into the Paradise of the old serpent?         Why hast thou crept         Into thyself, thyself?...\u201d",

    "question": "What does it mean for Zarathustra to be \"Self knower!\" and \"Self hangman!\" in the poem?",
    "answer": "Being \"Self knower!\" and \"Self hangman!\" in the poem suggests that Zarathustra deeply understands himself and is responsible for his own actions. It implies that he is both an observer and a judge of his own behavior, as if he is hanging himself with the noose of his own wisdom. This metaphor highlights his self-awareness and the consequences of his choices.",
