    "paragraph": "\u201cIndeed, man does not change so quickly; his psychology at bottom  remains the same, and even if his culture varies much from one epoch  to another, it does not change the functioning of his mind. The  fundamental laws of the mind remain the same, at least during the  short historical period of which we have knowledge, and all phenomena,  even the most strange, must be capable of explanation by those common  laws of the mind which we can recognize in ourselves.\u201dThe psychologist should accept this viewpoint without reservation as peculiarly applicable to himself. To-day, indeed, in our civilization the phallic processions, the Dionysian mysteries of classical Athens, the barefaced Phallic emblems, have disappeared from our coins, houses, temples and streets; so also have the theriomorphic representations of the Deity been reduced to small remnants, like the Dove of the Holy Ghost, the Lamb of God and the Cock of Peter adorning our church towers. In the same way, the capture and violation of women have shrunken away to crimes. Yet all of this does not affect the fact that we, in childhood, go through a period in which the impulses toward these archaic inclinations appear again and again, and that through all our life we possess, side by side with the newly recruited, directed and adapted thought, a phantastic thought which corresponds to the thought of the centuries of antiquity and barbarism. Just as our bodies still keep the reminders of old functions and conditions in many old-fashioned organs, so our minds, too, which apparently have outgrown those archaic tendencies, nevertheless bear the marks of the evolution passed through, and the very ancient re-echoes, at least dreamily, in phantasies.",

    "question": "How does the author compare the mind to the body in terms of retaining old functions and conditions?\n\n**ANS Riverside:**\nThe author compares the mind to the body in that both retain evidence of past functions and conditions. Just as the body retains old organs from evolutionary processes, the mind retains thoughts and impulses that reflect earlier epochs and cultures, even as these aspects may no longer be openly expressed or practiced in modern times.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does the author imply about the persistence of archaic thought in modern phantasies?",
    "answer": "The author implies that even as archaic thought and practices have become less visible in modern society, they continue to echo in the form of dreams and phantasies. This suggests that the mind retains a part of these ancient tendencies, which may manifest subconsciously even though they are no longer openly acknowledged or practiced.",
