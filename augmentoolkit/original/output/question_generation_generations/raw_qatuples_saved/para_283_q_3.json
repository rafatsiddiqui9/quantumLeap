    "paragraph": "The close relation of the generation of fire to the onanistic act is illustrated by a case, the knowledge of which I owe to Dr. Schmid, in Cery, that of an imbecile peasant youth who set many incendiary fires. At one of these conflagrations he drew suspicion to himself by his behavior. He stood with his hands in his trouser pockets in the door of an opposite house and gazed with apparent delight at the fire. Under examination in the insane asylum, he described the fire in great detail, and made suspicious movements in his trouser pockets with his hands. The physical examination undertaken at once showed that he had masturbated. Later he confessed that he had masturbated at the time when he had enjoyed the fire which he had enkindled himself.",

    "question": "How does the behavior of the youth during the fire incident and his subsequent confession illustrate a close relation between the generation of fire and onanistic behavior?",
    "answer": "The youth's behavior during the fire incident, including his delight in watching the fire and the movements in his trouser pockets, suggested a connection between his enjoyment of the fire and his onanistic behavior. His confession that he had masturbated while enjoying the fire he had started himself further illustrates this close relation.",
