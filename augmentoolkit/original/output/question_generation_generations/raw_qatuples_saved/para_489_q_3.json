Nevertheless it wandered everywhere, and  strove to behold It. _It penetrated the air, it wandered over the  Heavens, it crossed over the abysses, it searched, as it seemed to it,  the ends of the world._[138] But in all of that it found nothing, for  all was created. And I lamented and was sorrowful, and my breast  burned, and I lived as one distraught in mind. But It came, as It  would, and descending like a luminous mystic cloud, It seemed to  envelop my whole head so that dismayed I cried out. But flying away  again It left me alone. And when I, troubled, sought for It, I  realized suddenly _that It was in me, myself, and in the midst of my  heart It appeared as the light of a spherical sun_.\u201dIn Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cGlory and Eternity\u201d we meet with an essentially similar symbol:\u201cHush! I see vastness!\u2014and of vasty things     Shall man be done, unless he can enshrine     Them with his words? Then take the night which brings     The heart upon thy tongue, charmed wisdom mine!\u201cI look above, there rolls the star-strewn sea.     O night, mute silence, voiceless cry of stars!     And lo! A sign! The heaven its verge unbars\u2014     A shining constellation falls towards me.\u201d[139]It is not astonishing if Nietzsche\u2019s great inner loneliness calls again into existence certain forms of thought which the mystic ecstasy of the old cults has elevated to ritual representation. In the visions of the Mithraic liturgy we have to deal with many similar representations which we can now understand without difficulty as the ecstatic symbol of the libido:",

    "question": "How does the author's experience in search of the uncreated splendor compare to the vision described in the passage from Nietzsche's \"Glory and Eternity\"?",
    "answer": "The author's experience in searching for the uncreated splendor is similar to the vision in Nietzsche's \"Glory and Eternity,\" where the author sees vastness and seeks to enshrine it with words. Both describe a quest for something beyond the created world, highlighting the importance of language and perception in understanding and experiencing the divine.",
