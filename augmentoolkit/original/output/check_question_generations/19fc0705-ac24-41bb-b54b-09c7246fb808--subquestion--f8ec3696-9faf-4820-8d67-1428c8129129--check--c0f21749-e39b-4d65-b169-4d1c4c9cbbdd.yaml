    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ self-rejuvenation, and evidently expresses the fulfilment of the wish that it\
    \ _might be possible for the mother to bear me again_; at the same time, applied\
    \ to the heroes, it means one is a hero who is borne again by her who has previously\
    \ been his mother; that is to say, _a hero is he who may again produce himself\
    \ through his mother_.The countless suggestions in the history of the procreation\
    \ of the heroes indicate the latter formulations. Hiawatha’s father first overpowered\
    \ the mother under the symbol of the bear; then himself becoming a god, he procreates\
    \ the hero. What Hiawatha had to do as hero, Nokomis hinted to him in the legend\
    \ of the origin of the moon; he is forcibly to throw his mother upwards (or throw\
    \ downwards?); then she would become pregnant by this act of violence and could\
    \ bring forth a daughter. This rejuvenated mother would be allotted, according\
    \ to the Egyptian rite, as a daughter-wife to the sun-god, the father of his mother,\
    \ for self-reproduction. What action Hiawatha takes in this regard we shall see\
    \ presently. We have already studied the behavior of the pre-Asiatic gods related\
    \ to Christ. Concerning the pre-existence of Christ, the Gospel of St. John is\
    \ full of this thought. Thus the speech of John the Baptist:“This is he of whom\
    \ I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred  before me; for he was before\
    \ me.”—_John_ i: 30.Also the beginning of the gospel is full of deep mythologic\
    \ significance:“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\
    \ the  Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.(3) “All things were\
    \ made by him, and without him was not anything  made that was made.(4) “In him\
    \ was life, and the _life_ was the _light of men_.(5) “And the light shineth in\

    According to Nokomis’s legend, Hiawatha has to forcibly throw his mother upwards\
    \ (or downwards) to make her pregnant through this act of violence. This action\
    \ is significant because it symbolizes the process of rejuvenation and self-reproduction,\
