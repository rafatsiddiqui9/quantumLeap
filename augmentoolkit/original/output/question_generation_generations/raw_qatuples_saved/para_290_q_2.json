    "paragraph": "The condition depicted by the author here corresponds to such a one as usually precedes an intentional somnambulism[342] often described by spiritualistic mediums. A certain inclination to listen to these low nocturnal voices must be assumed; otherwise such fine and hardly perceptible inner experiences pass unnoticed. We recognize in this listening a current of the libido leading inward and beginning to flow towards a still invisible, mysterious goal. It seems that the libido has suddenly discovered an object in the depths of the unconscious which powerfully attracts it. The life of man, turned wholly to the external by nature, does not ordinarily permit such introversion; there must, therefore, be surmised a certain exceptional condition, that is to say, a lack of external objects, which compels the individual to seek a substitute for them in his own soul. It is, however, difficult to imagine that this rich world has become too poor to offer an object for the love of human atoms; nor can the world and its objects be held accountable for this lack. It offers boundless opportunities for every one. It is rather the _incapacity to love which robs mankind of his possibilities_. This world is empty to him alone who does not understand how to direct his libido towards objects, and to render them alive and beautiful for himself, for Beauty does not indeed lie in things, but in the feeling that we give to them. That which compels us to create a substitute for ourselves is not the external lack of objects, but our incapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of ourselves. Certainly the difficulties of the conditions of life and the adversities of the struggle for existence may oppress us, yet even adverse external situations would not hinder the giving out of the libido; on the contrary, they may spur us on to the greatest exertions, whereby we bring our whole libido into reality.",

    "question": "What does the author imply about the relationship between external objects and one\u2019s ability to love?",
    "answer": "The author implies that it is not the lack of external objects that prevents people from loving; rather, it is the incapacity to direct one\u2019s libido towards objects and to make them meaningful and beautiful. The author suggests that the world offers boundless opportunities for love, but this richness is perceived as emptiness by those who lack the ability to give love to objects and find beauty in them.",
