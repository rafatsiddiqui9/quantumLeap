    "paragraph": "In this phase of the problem lies the third great difference between Jung\u2019s interpretation of the observed phenomena and that of Freud.Jung definitely recognizes that there are many neurotic persons who clearly exhibited in their childhood the same neurotic tendencies that are later exaggerated. Also that an almost overwhelming effect on the destiny of these children is exercised by the influence of the parents, the frequent over-anxiety or tenderness, the lack of sympathy or understanding, in other words, the complexes of the parent reacting upon the child and producing in him love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate, revolt. The greater the sensitiveness and impressionability of the child, the more he will be stamped with the familial environment, and the more he will unconsciously seek to find again in the world of reality the model of his own small world with all the pleasures and satisfactions, or disappointments and unhappinesses with which it was filled.",

    "question": "How does parental influence affect a child's neurotic tendencies according to Jung?",
    "answer": "Parental influence, especially through over-anxiety or tenderness, lack of sympathy or understanding, and the presence of complexes, significantly affects a child's neurotic tendencies. These parental behaviors can instill feelings such as love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate, and revolt in the child. The more sensitive and impressionable the child is, the more they are likely to be shaped by the familial environment and seek to replicate it in their reality.",
