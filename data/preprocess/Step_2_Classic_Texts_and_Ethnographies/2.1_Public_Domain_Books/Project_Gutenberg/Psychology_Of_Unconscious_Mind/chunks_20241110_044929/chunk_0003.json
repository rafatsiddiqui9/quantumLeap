HINKLE.\n\n\n =10 Gramercy Park.=\n\n                             AUTHOR’S NOTE\n\n\n\nMy task in this work has been to investigate an individual phantasy\nsystem, and in the doing of it problems of such magnitude have been\nuncovered, that my endeavor to grasp them in their entirety has\nnecessarily meant only a superficial orientation toward those paths, the\nopening and exploration of which may possibly crown the work of future\ninvestigators with success.\n\nI am not in sympathy with the attitude which favors the repression of\ncertain possible working hypotheses because they are perhaps erroneous,\nand so may possess no lasting value. Certainly I endeavored as far as\npossible to guard myself from error, which might indeed become\nespecially dangerous upon these dizzy heights, for I am entirely aware\nof the risks of these investigations. However, I do not consider\nscientific work as a dogmatic contest, but rather as a work done for the\nincrease and deepening of knowledge.\n\nThis contribution is addressed to those having similar ideas concerning\nscience.\n\nIn conclusion, I must render thanks to those who have assisted my\nendeavors with valuable aid, especially my dear wife and my friends, to\nwhose disinterested assistance I am deeply indebted.\n\n                                                             C.

because of its disturbing nature, expressed not directly,\n        but symbolically.\n\n II.—   THE MILLER PHANTASIES                                           42\n\n\n        Miss Miller’s unusual

which gives to facts their value and significance,\nis often very useful, even if it is partially false, for it throws light\non phenomena which no one observed, it forces an examination, from many\nangles, of facts which no one had hitherto studied, and it gives the\nimpulse for more extended and more productive researches._\n\n“_It is, therefore, a moral duty for the man of science to expose\nhimself to the risk of committing error and to submit to criticism, in\norder that science may continue to progress. A writer has attacked the\nauthor for this very severely, saying, here is a scientific ideal very\nlimited and very paltry. But those who are endowed with a mind\nsufficiently serious and impersonal as not to believe that all that they\nwrite is the expression of truth absolute and eternal, approve of this\ntheory which places the aims of science well above the miserable vanity\nand paltry ‘amour propre’ of the scientist._”—GUGLIELMO FERRERO.\n\n         _Les Lois Psychologiques du Symbolisme—1895.
