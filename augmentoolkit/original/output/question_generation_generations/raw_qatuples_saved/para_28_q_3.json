    "paragraph": "\u201cWhoever in dreams surrounds his body with bast, creepers or ropes,  with snake-skins, threads, or tissues, dies.\u201dI refer to the preceding arguments in regard to this. Having come into the west land, the hero challenges the magician to battle. A terrible struggle begins. Hiawatha is powerless, because Megissogwon is invulnerable. At evening Hiawatha retires wounded, despairing for a while, in order to rest:\u201cPaused to rest beneath a pine-tree,         From whose branches trailed the mosses,         And whose trunk was coated over         With the Dead-man\u2019s Moccasin-leather,         With the fungus white and yellow.\u201dThis protecting tree is described as coated over with the moccasin leather of the dead, the fungus. This investing of the tree with anthropomorphic attributes is also an important rite wherever tree worship prevails, as, for example, in India, where each village has its sacred tree, which is clothed and in general treated as a human being. The trees are anointed with fragrant waters, sprinkled with powder, adorned with garlands and draperies. Just as among men, the piercing of the _ears was performed as an apotropaic charm against death, so does it occur with the holy tree_. Of all the trees of India there is none more sacred to the Hindoos than the Aswatha (Ficus religiosa). It is known to them as Vriksha Raja (king of trees), Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesvar live in it, and the worship of it is the worship of the triad. Almost every Indian village has an Aswatha,[688] etc. This \u201cvillage linden tree,\u201d well known to us, is here clearly characterized as the mother symbol; it contains the three gods.",

    "question": "How do the practices of tree worship in different cultures, as described in the passage, reflect the anthropomorphic attributes ascribed to trees?",
    "answer": "Tree worship in various cultures often involves treating trees with anthropomorphic attributes. In India, trees are anointed with fragrant waters, sprinkled with powder, and adorned with garlands and draperies, much like how humans are cared for and adorned. This practice reflects the belief that trees possess divine and protective qualities, similar to human beings. The Aswatha tree, for instance, is treated as a sacred being and is considered a home for multiple deities, further emphasizing the anthropomorphic attributes ascribed to trees in these cultures.",
