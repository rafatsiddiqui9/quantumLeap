And the boy looks up familiarly  To his Father, Helios,  And, tasting the sweet grapes,  He picked the sacred vine for his nurse,  And soon he is grown; the beasts  Fear him, for he is different from them:  This man; he is not like thee, the father,  For the lofty soul of the father,  Is in him boldly united with thy pleasures,  And thy sadness, O Earth,  He may resemble the eternal Nature,  The mother of Gods, the terrible Mother.\u201cAh! therefore, O Earth,  His presumption drives him away from thy breast,  And thy gifts are vain, the tender ones;  Ever and ever too high does the proud heart beat.\u201cOut from the sweet meadow of his shores  Man must go into the flowerless waters,  And tho his groves shine with golden fruit,  Like the starry night, yet he digs,  He digs caves in the mountains, and seeks in the mines,  Far from the sacred rays of his father,  Faithless also to the Sun-god,  Who does not love weaklings, and mocks at cares.\u201cAh! freer do the birds of the wood breathe:  Although the breast of man heaves wilder and more proudly,  His pride becomes fear, and the tender flowers  Of his peace do not bloom for long.\u201dThis poem betrays to us the beginning of the discord between the poet and nature; he begins to be estranged from reality, the natural actual existence. It is a remarkable idea how the little child chooses \u201cthe vine for his nurse.\u201d This Dionysian allusion is very old. In the significant blessing of Jacob it is said of Judah (Genesis, chap. xlix, verse 11):\u201cBinding his foal unto the vine, and his ass\u2019s colt unto the choice  vine.\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
