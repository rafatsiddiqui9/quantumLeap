    "paragraph": "Let us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom of boring. Let us imagine a strong adult man carrying on the boring with two pieces of wood with the same perseverance and the energy corresponding to that of this child. He may very easily create fire by this play. But of greatest significance in this work is the rhythm.[307] This hypothesis seems to me psychologically possible, although it should not be said with this that only in this way could the discovery of fire occur. It can result just as well by the striking together of flints. It is scarcely possible that fire was created in only one way. All I want to establish here is merely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications of which point to the possibility that in such a way was fire invented or prepared.",

    "question": "Imagine a scenario where an adult is persistently and energetically rubbing two pieces of wood together. What might be the significance of the rhythmic motion in this context?",
    "answer": "The rhythmic motion in this scenario is significant because it mimics a process that could potentially lead to the creation of fire. The rhythmic action, though simple, can generate enough friction to create heat and eventually ignite materials.",
