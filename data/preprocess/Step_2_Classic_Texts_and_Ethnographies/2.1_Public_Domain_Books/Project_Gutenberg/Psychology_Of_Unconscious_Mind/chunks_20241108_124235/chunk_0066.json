But what robs nature of its glamour, and life of its joy, is\nthe poison of the retrospective longing, which harks back, in order to\nsink into its own depths:\n\n                              _Empedocles._\n\n          “Thou seekest life—and a godly fire springs to thee,\n          Gushing and gleaming, from the deeps of the earth;\n          And, with shuddering longing,\n          Throws thee down into the flames of Aetna.\n\n          “So, through a queen’s wanton whim,\n          Pearls are dissolved in wine—restrain her not!\n          Didst thou not throw thy riches, Poet,\n          Into the bright and bubbling cup!\n\n          “Still thou art holy to me, as the Power of Earth\n          Which took thee away, lovely assassin!...\n          And I would have followed the hero to the depths,\n          Had Love not held me.”\n\nThis poem betrays the secret longing for the maternal depths.[795]\n\nHe would like to be sacrificed in the chalice, dissolved in wine like\npearls (the “crater” of rebirth), yet love holds him within the light of\nday. The libido still has an object, for the sake of which life is worth\nliving. But were this object abandoned, then the libido would sink into\nthe realm of the subterranean, the mother, who brings forth again:\n\n                             _Obituary._\n\n                         (Unfinished poem.)\n\n “Daily I go a different path.\n Sometimes into the green wood, sometimes to the bath in the spring;\n Or to the rocks where the roses bloom.\n From the top of the hill I look over the land,\n Yet nowhere, thou lovely one, nowhere in the light do I find thee;\n And in the breezes my words die away,\n The sacred words which once we had.\n\n “Aye, thou art far away, O holy countenance!\n And the melody of thy life is kept from me,\n No longer overheard. And, ah, where are\n Thy magic songs which once soothed my heart\n With the peace of Heaven?\n How long it is, how long!\n The youth is aged; the very earth itself, which once smiled on me,\n Has grown different.\n\n “Oh, farewell! The soul of every day departs, and, departing, turns to\n    thee—\n And over thee there weeps\n The eye that, becoming brighter,\n Looks down,\n There where thou tarriest.”\n\nThis distinctly suggests a renunciation, an envy of one’s own youth,\nthat time of freedom which one would like to retain through a\ndeep-rooted dislike to all duty and endeavor which is denied an\nimmediate pleasure reward. Painstaking work for a long time and for a\nremote object is not in the nature of child or primitive man. It is\ndifficult to say if this can really be called laziness, but it seems to\nhave not a little in common with it, in so far as the psychic life on a\nprimitive stage, be it of an infantile or archaic type, possesses an\nextreme inertia and irresponsibility in production and non-production.\n\nThe last stanza portends evil, a gazing towards the other land, the\ndistant coast of sunrise or sunset; love no longer holds the poet, the\nbonds with the world are torn and he calls loudly for assistance to the\nmother:\n\n                         _Achilles._\n\n “Lordly son of the Gods! Because you lost your loved one,\n You went to the rocky coast and cried aloud to the flood,\n Till the depths of the holy abyss heard and echoed your grief,\n From the far reaches of your heart. Down, deep down, far from the clamor\n    of ships,\n Deep under the waves, in a peaceful cave,\n Dwelt the beautiful Thetis, she who protected you, the Goddess of the\n    Sea,\n Mother of the youth was she; the powerful Goddess,\n She who once had lovingly nursed him,\n On the rocky shore of his island; she who had made him a hero\n With the might of her strengthening bath and the powerful song of the\n    waves.\n And the mother, mourning, hearkened to the cry of her child,\n And rose, like a cloud, from the bed of the sea,\n Soothing with tender embraces the pains of her darling;\n And he listened, while she, caressing, promised to soften his grief.\n\n\n “Son of the Gods! Oh, were I like you, then could I confidently\n Call on the Heavenly Ones to hearken to my secret grief.\n But never shall I see this—I shall bear the disgrace\n As if I never belonged to her, even though she thinks of me with tears.\n Beneficent Ones! And yet Ye hear the lightest prayers of men.\n Ah, how rapt and fervently I worshipped you, holy Light,\n Since I have lived, the Earth and its fountains and woodlands,\n Father Ether—and my heart has felt you about me, so ardent and pure—\n Oh, soften my sorrows, ye Kind Ones,\n That my soul may not be silenced, may not be struck dumb too early;\n That I may live and thank Ye, O Heavenly Powers,\n With joyful songs through all the hurrying days.\n Thank ye for gifts of the past, for the joys of vanished Youth—\n And then, pray, take me, the lonely one,\n Graciously, unto yourselves.”\n\nThese poems describe more plainly than could be depicted with meagre\nwords the persistent arrest and the constantly growing estrangement from\nlife, the gradual deep immersion into the maternal abyss of the\nindividual being. The apocalyptic song of Patmos is strangely related to\nthese songs of retrogressive longing. It enters as a dismal guest\nsurrounded by the mist of the depths, the gathering clouds of insanity,\nbred through the mother. In it the primitive thoughts of the myth, the\nsuggestion clad in symbols, of the sun-like death and resurrection of\nlife, again burst forth. Similar things are to be found in abundance\namong sick people of this sort.\n\nI reproduce some significant fragments from Patmos:\n\n                       “Near is the God\n                       And hard to comprehend,\n                       But where Danger threatens\n                       The Rescuer appears.”\n\nThese words mean that the libido has now sunk to the lowest depths,\nwhere “the danger is great.” (Faust, Part II, Mother scene.) There “the\nGod is near”; there man may find the inner sun, his own nature, sun-like\nand self-renewing, hidden in the mother-womb like the sun in the\nnighttime:\n\n            “... In Chasms\n            And in darkness dwell\n            The eagles; and fresh and fearlessly\n            The Sons of the Alps pass swiftly over the abyss\n            Upon lightly swinging bridges.”\n\nWith these words the dark phantastic poem passes on. The eagle, the bird\nof the sun, dwells in darkness—the libido has hidden itself, but high\nabove it the inhabitants of the mountains pass, probably the gods (“Ye\nare walking above in the light”), symbols of the sun wandering across\nthe sky, like the eagle flying over the depths:\n\n            “... Above and around are reared\n            The summits of Time,\n            And the loved ones, though near,\n            Live on deeply separated mountains.\n            So give us waters of innocence,\n            And give us wings of true understanding,\n            With which to pass across and to return again.”\n\nThe first is a gloomy picture of the mountains and of time—although\ncaused by the sun wandering over the mountains, the following picture a\nnearness, and at the same time separation, of the lovers, and seems to\nhint at life in the underworld,[796] where he is united with all that\nonce was dear to him, and yet cannot enjoy the happiness of reunion,\nbecause it is all shadows and unreal and devoid of life. Here the one\nwho descends drinks the waters of innocence, the waters of childhood,\nthe drink of rejuvenation,[797] so wings may grow, and, winged, he may\nsoar up again into life, like the winged sun, which arises like a swan\nfrom the water (“Wings, to pass across and to return again”):\n\n              “... So I spoke, and lo, a genie\n              Carried me off, swifter than I had imagined,\n              And farther than ever I had thought\n              From my own house!\n              It grew dark\n              As I went in the twilight.\n              The shadowy wood,\n              And the yearning brooks of my home-land\n              Grew vague behind me—\n              And I knew the country no longer.”\n\nAfter the dark and obscure words of the introduction, wherein the poet\nexpresses the prophecy of what is to come, the sun journey begins\n(“night journey in the sea”) towards the east, towards the ascent,\ntowards the mystery of eternity and rebirth, of which Nietzsche also\ndreams, and which he expressed in significant words:\n\n  “Oh, how could I not be ardent for eternity, and for the nuptial ring\n  of rings—the ring of the return! Never yet have I found the woman from\n  whom I wish children, unless she would be this woman whom I love; for\n  I love thee, O eternity.”\n\nHölderlin expresses this same longing in a beautiful symbol, the\nindividual traits of which are already familiar to us:\n\n          “... But soon in a fresh radiance\n          Mysteriously\n          Blossoming in golden smoke,\n          With the rapidly growing steps of the sun,\n          Making a thousand summits fragrant,\n          Asia arose!\n          And, dazzled,\n          I sought one whom I knew;\n          For unfamiliar to me were the broad roads,\n          Where from Tmolus\n          Comes the gilded Pactol,\n          And Taurus stands and Messagis—\n          And the gardens are full of flowers.\n          But high up in the light\n          The silvery snow gleams, a silent fire;\n          And, as a symbol of eternal life,\n          On the impassable walls,\n          Grows the ancient ivy.[798]\n          And carried by columns of living cedars and laurels\n          Are the solemn, divinely built palaces.”\n\nThe symbol is apocalyptic, the maternal city in the land of eternal\nyouth, surrounded by the verdure and flowers of imperishable\nspring.[799] The poet identifies himself here with John, who lived on\nPatmos, who was once associated with “the sun of the Highest,” and saw\nhim face to face:\n\n      “There at the Mystery of the Vine they met,\n      There at the hour of the Holy Feast they gathered,\n      And—feeling the approach of Death in his great, quiet soul,\n      The Lord, pouring out his last love, spoke,\n      And then he died.\n      Much could be said of it—\n      How his triumphant glance,\n      The happiest of all,\n      Was seen by his companions, even at the last.\n\n             ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n      Therefore he sent the Spirit unto them,\n      And the house trembled, solemnly;\n      And, with distant thunder,\n      The storm of God rolled over the cowering heads\n      Where, deep in thought,\n      The heroes of death were assembled....\n      Now, when he, in parting,\n      Appeared once more before them,\n      Then the kingly day, the day of the sun, was put out,\n      And the gleaming sceptre, formed of his rays,\n      Was broken—and suffered like a god itself.\n      Yet it shall return and glow again\n      When the right time comes.”",
