    "paragraph": "anxiety attributes, are the symbolic representations of anxiety which correspond to the repressed incest wish. It is, therefore, intelligible, when we come across the tree with the snake again and again (in Paradise the snake even tempts to sin). The snake or dragon possesses in particular the meaning of treasure guardian and defender. The phallic, as well as the feminine, meaning of the dragon[542] indicates that it is again a symbol of the sexual neutral (or bisexual) libido, that is to say, a symbol of the _libido in opposition_. In this significance the black horse, Apaosha, the demon of opposition, appears in the old Persian song, Tishtriya, where it obstructs the sources of the rain lake. The white horse Tishtriya makes two futile attempts to vanquish Apaosha; at the third attempt, with the help of Ahuramazda, he is successful.[543] Whereupon the sluices of heaven open and a fruitful rain pours down upon the earth.[544] In this song one sees very beautifully in the choice of symbol how libido is opposed to libido, will against will, the discordance of primitive man with himself, which he recognizes again in all the adversity and contrasts of external nature.",

    "question": "What do the white and black horses in the old Persian song, Tishtriya, represent, and what does their interaction signify?",
    "answer": "In the old Persian song, Tishtriya, the white horse Tishtriya represents the positive or constructive aspect of libido, symbolizing effort and action. The black horse, Apaosha, represents the negative or obstructive aspect of libido and symbolizes opposition and discord. Their interaction signifies the struggle between opposing forces, where the constructive force (Tishtriya) seeks to overcome the obstructive force (Apaosha) with the help of a higher authority, ultimately leading to a resolution and positive outcome.",
