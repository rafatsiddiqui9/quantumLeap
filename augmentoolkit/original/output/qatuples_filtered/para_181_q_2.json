    "paragraph": "disguise with a sentimental stage trickery worthy of our posthumous edition of \u201cChristian morals.\u201d In place of the positive phallus, the negative appears, and leads the hero\u2019s horse (his libido animalis), not to satisfaction, but into eternal peace\u2014also the fate of the hero. This end means that the mother, represented as the jaws of death, devours the libido of the daughter. Therefore, instead of life and procreative growth, only phantastic self-oblivion results. This weak and inglorious end has no elevating or illuminating meaning so long as we consider it merely as the solution of an individual erotic conflict. The fact that the symbols under which the solution takes place have actually a significant aspect, reveals to us that behind the individual mask, behind the veil of \u201cindividuation,\u201d a primitive idea stands, the severe and serious features of which take from us the courage to consider the sexual meaning of the Miller symbolism as all-sufficient.",
