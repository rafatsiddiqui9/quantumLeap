    "question": "What was the nature of the spectacle that took place in a cave near Rome, and how did it involve a dragon?",
    "answer": "In a cave near Rome, there was a spectacle involving a dragon that had been crafted using mechanical art. The dragon held a sword in its mouth and had eyes that shone with precious gems, making it a fearful and terrifying sight. As part of a yearly ritual, young virgins adorned with flowers would be given to this dragon as an offering. They would climb a staircase, unaware that the dragon, which hung from the staircase by an artifice of the devil, would strike them with the approaching sword, causing them to fall and bleed to death.",
