    "paragraph": "It is well known that trees have played a large part in the cult myth from the remotest times. The typical myth tree is the tree of paradise or of life which we discover abundantly used in Babylonian and also in Jewish lore; and in prechristian times, the pine tree of Attis, the tree or trees of Mithra; in Germanic mythology, Ygdrasil and so on. The hanging of the Attis image on the pine tree; the hanging of Marsyas, which became a celebrated artistic motive; the hanging of Odin; the Germanic hanging sacrifices\u2014indeed, the whole series of hanged gods\u2014teaches us that the hanging of Christ on the cross is not a unique occurrence in religious mythology, but belongs to the same circle of ideas as others. In this world of imagery the cross of Christ is the tree of life, and equally the wood of death. This contrast is not astounding. Just as the origin of man from trees was a legendary idea, so there were also burial customs, in which people were buried in hollow trees. From that the German language retains even now the expression \u201cTotenbaum\u201d (tree of death) for a coffin. Keeping in mind the fact that the tree is predominantly a mother symbol, then the mystic significance of this manner of burial can be in no way incomprehensible to us. _The dead are delivered back to the mother for rebirth._ We encounter this symbol in the Osiris myth, handed down by Plutarch,[467] which is, in general, typical in various aspects. Rhea is pregnant with Osiris; at the same time also with Isis; Osiris and Isis mate even in the mother\u2019s womb (motive of the night journey on the sea with incest). Their son is Arueris, later called Horus. It is said of Isis that she was born \u201cin absolute humidity\u201d (\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03bd \u1f3c\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cd\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9[468]). It is said of Osiris that a certain Pamyles in Thebes heard a voice from the temple of Zeus while drawing water, which commanded him to proclaim that Osiris was born \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03ad\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f4c\u03c3\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2.",

    "question": "How does the text explain the symbolism of the tree in burial customs?",
    "answer": "The text explains that the tree symbolizes a mother figure and was used in burial customs where people were buried in hollow trees. This practice is reflected in the German language term \"Totenbaum\" (tree of death) for a coffin. This symbolism suggests that the dead are returned to the mother for rebirth, a concept that can be understood based on the tree's maternal significance.",
