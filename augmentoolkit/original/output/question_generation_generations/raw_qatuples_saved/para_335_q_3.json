    "paragraph": "The indirect course of the libido seems to be a way of sorrow; at least \u201cParadise Lost\u201d and the parallel reference to Job lead one to that conclusion. If we take, in addition to this, the introductory intimation of the identification with Christian, which we see concludes with Cyrano, then we are furnished with material which pictures the indirect course of the libido as truly a way of sorrow. It is the same as when mankind, after the sinful fall, had the burden of the earthly life to bear, or like the tortures of Job, who suffered under the power of Satan and of God, and who himself, without suspecting it, became a plaything of the superhuman forces which we no longer consider as metaphysical, but as metapsychological. Faust also offers us the same exhibition of God\u2019s wager._Mephistopheles_:What will you bet? There\u2019s still a chance to gain him      If unto me full leave you give      Gently upon my road to train him!_Satan_:But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will  curse thee to thy face.\u2014_Job_ i: 11.While in Job the two great tendencies are characterized simply as good and bad, the problem in Faust is a pronouncedly erotic one; viz., the battle between sublimation and eros, in which the Devil is strikingly characterized through the fitting r\u00f4le of the erotic tempter. The erotic is lacking in Job; at the same time Job is not conscious of the conflict within his own soul; he even continuously disputes the arguments of his friends who wish to convince him of evil in his own heart. To this extent, one might say that Faust is considerably more honorable since he openly confesses to the torments of his soul.",

    "question": "How does the author view the role of Satan in the conflict between sublimation and eros in \"Faust\"?",
    "answer": "The author views Satan, in the role of Mephistopheles, as the fitting erotic tempter in \"Faust.\" This character represents the temptation and desire that conflict with the process of sublimation, highlighting the battle between these two forces in Faust's soul.",
