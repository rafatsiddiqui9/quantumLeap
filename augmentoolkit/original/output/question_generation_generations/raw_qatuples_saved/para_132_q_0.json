    "paragraph": "As we learn through Freud, the dream shows a similar type. Since the dream is unconcerned with the real condition of things, it brings the most heterogeneous matter together, and a world of impossibilities takes the place of realities. Freud finds progression characteristic of thinking when awake; that is to say, the advancement of the thought excitation from the system of the inner or outer perception through the \u201cendopsychic\u201d work of association, conscious and unconscious, to the motor end; that is to say, towards innervation. In the dream he finds the reverse, namely, regression of the thought excitation from the preconscious or unconscious to the system of perception, by the means of which the dream receives its ordinary impression of sensuous distinctness, which can rise to an almost hallucinating clearness. The dream thinking moves in a retrograde manner towards the raw material of memory. \u201cThe structure of the dream thoughts is dissolved during the progress of regression into its raw material.\u201d The reanimation of the original perception is, however, only one side of regression. The other side is regression to the infantile memory material, which might also be understood as regression to the original perception, but which deserves especial mention on account of its independent importance. This regression might, indeed, be considered as \u201chistorical.\u201d The dream, according to this conception, might also be described as _the substitute of the infantile scene, changed through transference into the recent scene_.",

    "question": "According to Freud, how does the dream process differ from waking thought in terms of progression?",
    "answer": "According to Freud, the progression of waking thought moves from the system of inner or outer perception through the \"endopsychic\" work of association (both conscious and unconscious) to the motor end, leading to innervation. In contrast, the progression in dreams is reversed, moving from the preconscious or unconscious back to the system of perception, resulting in a world of impossibilities that can appear almost hallucinatory.",
