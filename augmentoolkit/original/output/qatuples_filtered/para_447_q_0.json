    "paragraph": "The motive of the two mothers suggests the thought of self-rejuvenation, and evidently expresses the fulfilment of the wish that it _might be possible for the mother to bear me again_; at the same time, applied to the heroes, it means one is a hero who is borne again by her who has previously been his mother; that is to say, _a hero is he who may again produce himself through his mother_.The countless suggestions in the history of the procreation of the heroes indicate the latter formulations. Hiawatha\u2019s father first overpowered the mother under the symbol of the bear; then himself becoming a god, he procreates the hero. What Hiawatha had to do as hero, Nokomis hinted to him in the legend of the origin of the moon; he is forcibly to throw his mother upwards (or throw downwards?); then she would become pregnant by this act of violence and could bring forth a daughter. This rejuvenated mother would be allotted, according to the Egyptian rite, as a daughter-wife to the sun-god, the father of his mother, for self-reproduction. What action Hiawatha takes in this regard we shall see presently. We have already studied the behavior of the pre-Asiatic gods related to Christ. Concerning the pre-existence of Christ, the Gospel of St. John is full of this thought. Thus the speech of John the Baptist:\u201cThis is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred  before me; for he was before me.\u201d\u2014_John_ i: 30.Also the beginning of the gospel is full of deep mythologic significance:\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the  Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.(3) \u201cAll things were made by him, and without him was not anything  made that was made.(4) \u201cIn him was life, and the _life_ was the _light of men_.(5) \u201cAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth  it not.",

    "answer": "The motive of the two mothers suggests the thought of self-rejuvenation and implies the fulfillment of the wish that it might be possible for the mother to bear the child again. This suggests a desire for the mother to undergo a process of rejuvenation and reproduce once more.",
