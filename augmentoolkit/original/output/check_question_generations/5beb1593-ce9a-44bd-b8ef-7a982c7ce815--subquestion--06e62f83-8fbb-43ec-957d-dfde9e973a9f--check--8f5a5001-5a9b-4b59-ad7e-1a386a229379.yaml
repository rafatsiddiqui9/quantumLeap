    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ which we found in the mention of Ogyges in connection with the city. The maternal\
    \ significance of water belongs to the clearest symbolism in the realm of mythology,[440]\
    \ so that the ancients could say: ἠ θάλασσα—τῆς γενέσεως σύμβολον.[441] From water\
    \ comes life;[442] therefore, of the two gods which here interest us the most,\
    \ Christ and Mithra, the latter was born beside a river, according to representations,\
    \ while Christ experienced his new birth in the Jordan; moreover, he is born from\
    \ the Πηγή,[443] the “sempiterni fons amoris,” the mother of God, who by the heathen-Christian\
    \ legend was made a nymph of the Spring. The “Spring” is also found in Mithracism.\
    \ A Pannonian dedication reads, “Fonti perenni.” An inscription in Apulia is dedicated\
    \ to the “Fons Aeterni.” In Persia, Ardvîçûra is the well of the water of life.\
    \ Ardvîçûra-Anahita is a goddess of water and love (just as Aphrodite is born\
    \ from foam). The neo-Persians designate the Planet Venus and a nubile girl by\
    \ the name “Nahid.” In the temples of Anaitis there existed prostitute Hierodules\
    \ (harlots). In the Sakaeen (in honor of Anaitis) there, occurred ritual combats\
    \ as in the festival of the Egyptian Ares and his mother. In the Vedas the waters\
    \ are called Mâtritamâh—the most maternal.[443] All that is living rises as does\
    \ the sun, from the water, and at evening plunges into the water. Born from the\
    \ springs, the rivers, the seas, at death man arrives at the waters of the Styx\
    \ in order to enter upon the “night journey on the sea.” The wish is that the\
    \ black water of death might be the water of life; that death, with its cold embrace,\
    \ might be the mother’s womb, just as the sea devours the sun, but brings it forth\
    \ again out of the maternal womb (Jonah motive[444]). Life believes not in death.\n\
