It is this\nrecognition of these common factors basically inherent in humanity from\nthe beginning and still active, which is at once both the most hopeful\nand the most feared and disliked part of psychoanalysis.\n\nIt is disliked by those individuals who have prided themselves upon\ntheir superiority and the distinction between their reactions and\nmotives and those of ordinary mankind. In other words, they attempt to\nbecome personalities through elevating themselves and lowering others,\nand it is a distinct blow to discover that beneath these pretensions lie\nthe very ordinary elements shared in common by all. On the other hand,\nto those who have been able to recognize their own weaknesses and have\nsuffered in the privacy of their own souls, the knowledge that these\nthings have not set them apart from others, but that they are the common\nproperty of all and that no one can point the finger of scorn at his\nfellow, is one of the greatest experiences of life and is productive of\nthe greatest relief.\n\nIt is feared by many who realize that in these painfully acquired\nrepressions and symptoms lie their safety and their protection from\ndirectly facing and dealing with tendencies and characteristics with\nwhich they feel unable to cope. The repression and the accompanying\nsymptoms indicate a difficulty and a struggle, and in this way are a\nsort of compromise or substitute formation which permit, although only\nin a wasteful and futile manner, the activity of the repressed\ntendencies. Nevertheless, to analyze the individual back to his original\ntendencies and reveal to him the meaning of these substitute formations\nwould be a useless procedure in which truly “the last state of that man\nwould be worse than the first” if the work ceased there. The aim is not\nto destroy those barriers upon which civilized man has so painfully\nclimbed and to reduce him to his primitive state, but, where these have\nfailed or imperfectly succeeded, to help him to attain his greatest\npossibilities with less expenditure of energy, by less wasteful methods\nthan nature provides. In this achievement lies the hopeful and valuable\nside of this method—the development of the synthesis. It is hopeful\nbecause now a way is opened to deal with these primitive tendencies\nconstructively, and render their effects not only harmless but useful,\nby utilizing them in higher aims, socially and individually valuable and\nsatisfactory.\n\nThis is what has occurred normally in those individuals who seem capable\nand constructive personalities; in those creative minds that give so\nmuch to the race. They have converted certain psychological tendencies\nwhich could have produced useless symptoms or destructive actions into\nvaluable productions. Indeed it is not uncommon for strong, capable\npersons to state themselves that they knew they could have been equally\ncapable of a wasteful or destructive life. This utilization of the\nenergy or libido freed by removing the repressions and the lifting of\ninfantile tendencies and desires into higher purposes and directions\nsuitable for the individual at his present status is called\n_sublimation_.\n\nIt must not be understood by this discussion that geniuses or wonderful\npersonalities can be created through analysis, for this is not the aim\nof the procedure. Its purpose is to remove the inhibitions and\nrestrictions which interfere with the full development of the\npersonality, to help individuals attain to that level where they really\nbelong, and to prepare people to better understand and meet life whether\nthey are neurotic sufferers or so-called “normal people” with the\ndifficulties and peculiarities which belong to all.\n\nThis reasoning and method of procedure is only new when the application\nis made to the human being. In all improvements of plants and animals\nthese general principles have been recognized and their teachings\nconstructively utilized.\n\nLuther Burbank, that plant wizard whose work is known to all the world,\nsays, “A knowledge of the battle of the tendencies within a plant is the\nvery basis of all plant improvement,” and “it is not that the work of\nplant improvement brings with it, incidentally, as people mistakenly\nthink, a knowledge of these forces, it is the knowledge of these forces,\nrather, which makes plant improvement possible.”\n\nHas this not been also the mistake of man regarding himself, and the\ncause, partly at least, of his failure to succeed in actually reaching a\nmore advanced and stable development?\n\nThis recognition of man’s biological relationship to all life and the\npractical utilization of this recognition, necessitates a readjustment\nof thought and asks for an examination and reconsideration of the facts\nof human conduct which are observable by any thoughtful person. A quiet\nand progressive upheaval of old ideas has taken place and is still going\non. Analytic psychology attempts to unify and value all of the various\nphenomena of man which have been observed and noted at different times\nby isolated investigators of isolated manifestations and thus bring some\norderly sequence into the whole. It offers a method whereby the\nrelations of the human being biologically to all other living forms can\nbe established, the actual achievement of man himself adequately valued,\nand opens a vista of the possibilities of improvement in health,\nhappiness and accomplishment for the human being.\n\n                                                     BEATRICE M. HINKLE.\n\n =10 Gramercy Park.=\n\n\n\n\n                             AUTHOR’S NOTE\n\n\nMy task in this work has been to investigate an individual phantasy\nsystem, and in the doing of it problems of such magnitude have been\nuncovered, that my endeavor to grasp them in their entirety has\nnecessarily meant only a superficial orientation toward those paths, the\nopening and exploration of which may possibly crown the work of future\ninvestigators with success.\n\nI am not in sympathy with the attitude which favors the repression of\ncertain possible working hypotheses because they are perhaps erroneous,\nand so may possess no lasting value. Certainly I endeavored as far as\npossible to guard myself from error, which might indeed become\nespecially dangerous upon these dizzy heights, for I am entirely aware\nof the risks of these investigations. However, I do not consider\nscientific work as a dogmatic contest, but rather as a work done for the\nincrease and deepening of knowledge.\n\nThis contribution is addressed to those having similar ideas concerning\nscience.\n\nIn conclusion, I must render thanks to those who have assisted my\nendeavors with valuable aid, especially my dear wife and my friends, to\nwhose disinterested assistance I am deeply indebted.\n\n                                                             C.
