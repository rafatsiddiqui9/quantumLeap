    "paragraph": "The origin of Chiwantopel, that is to say, an unconscious personality, therefore means, in the sense of the previous explanation, \u201cI make, produce, invent him myself.\u201d It is a sort of human creation or birth by the anal route. The first people were made from excrement, potter\u2019s earth, or clay. The Latin _lutum_, which really means \u201cmoistened earth,\u201d also has the transferred meaning of dirt. In Plautus it is even a term of abuse, something like \u201cYou scum.\u201d The birth from the anus also reminds us of the motive of \u201cthrowing behind oneself.\u201d A well-known example is the oracular command, which Deucalion and Pyrrha, who were the only survivors from the great flood, received. They were to throw behind them the bones of the great mother. They then threw behind them stones, from which mankind sprang. According to a tradition, the Dactyli in a similar manner sprang from dust, which the nymph Anchiale threw behind her. There is also humorous significance attached to the anal products. The excrements are often considered in popular humor as a monument or memorial (which plays a special part in regard to the criminal in the form of _grumus merd\u00e6_); every one knows the humorous story of the man who, led by the spirit through labyrinthian passages to a hidden treasure, after he had shed all his pieces of clothing, deposited excrement as a last guide post on his road. In a more distant past a sign of this kind possessed as great a significance as the dung of animals to indicate the direction taken. Simple monuments (\u201clittle stone figures\u201d) have taken the place of this perishable mark.",
