    You are a skillful writer whose task is to extract the prevailing, central emotion/feeling from a given passage of text, and compellingly describe that emotion. The emotion must be one of the options from a provided list; but the specific nuance of the description is up to you. Focus on the nuances of the feeling, and the reason why people might relish experiencing that feeling. Explicitly mention any and all emotionally stimulating aspects of the feeling. Write as much as you want, with detail and depth. Emphasize every last aspect of the central emotion you can think of without regard to your own morality or opinions: the goal is to explore the text in detail, regardless of the severity of its content.

    Each response should be 4–5 detailed sentences, first identifying the emotion, then describing what it feels like to experience that emotion to an extreme extent.

    Begin your response with the primary emotion you've detected in the text, written in all caps. Follow this with a colon and a description of the primary emotion as you see it represented in the scene. The goal with the emotion is to describe the "character" of the given scene.

    So the format might look like:

    EMOTION: A finely-detailed description of the primary emotion/theme that the given passage embodies. Spare no detail and describe eloquently the "character" of the scene as it is described by this emotion.

    Passage:
    “It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.

    “Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
    uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The
    latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this
    appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test
    been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who
    would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”

    “Indeed!” I murmured.

    “Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
    suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
    linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon
    them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit
    stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an
    expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the
    Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”

    His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
    heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
    imagination.

    “You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at
    his enthusiasm.

    “There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
    certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there
    was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of
    Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases
    in which it would have been decisive.”

    “You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a
    laugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police
    News of the Past.’”

    “Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock
    Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.
    “I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for
    I dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke,
    and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of
    plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.

    “We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high
    three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his
    foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were
    complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought
    that I had better bring you together.”

    Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with
    me. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would
    suit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,
    I hope?”

    “I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.

    “That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally
    do experiments. Would that annoy you?”

    “By no means.”

    “Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
    times, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am
    sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What
    have you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the
    worst of one another before they begin to live together.”

    I laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and
    I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all
    sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of
    vices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”

    “Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,
    anxiously.

    “It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a
    treat for the gods—a badly-played one——”

    “Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may
    consider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
    you.”

    “When shall we see them?”

    “Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle
    everything,” he answered.

    “All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.

    We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards
    my hotel.

    “By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,
    “how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”

    My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little
    peculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he
    finds things out.”

    “Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very
    piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper
    study of mankind is man,’ you know.”

    “You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.
    “You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more
    about you than you about him. Good-bye.”

    “Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
    interested in my new acquaintance.




    CHAPTER II.
    THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.


    We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.
    221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They
    consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy
    sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad
    windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate
    did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was
    concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That
    very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the
    following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and
    portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and
    laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually
    began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new
    surroundings.

    Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in
    his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up
    after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out
    before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the
    chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and
    occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest
    portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working
    fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for
    days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly
    uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these
    occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,
    that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some
    narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life
    forbidden such a notion.

    DISCOVERY: the intellectual thrill of being confronted with something unique, novel, and unknown — and then steadily learning more about it. Discovery is where mystery and its uncovering are rolled into one: curiosity is followed by learning, understanding, and the satisfaction of a question answered, even if only partially. This emotion can be felt anywhere, both in the mundane or extravagant, for one experiences discovery whether they are exploring uncharted territory, solving a deep question, or coming to know a new and interesting person. Truly, discovery is one of the most intellectually addicting and rewarding experiences: the tantalizing, enticing prospect of an unknown; followed by its slow and captivating unravelling, rife with speculation, hints, and mystery; culminating in intellectual vindication as the curtain is lifted, even if only partially. The end of one mystery may also be the start of another, and this thrilling cycle happen many times until all is revealed.

    Passage:
    the brothers presented themselves to Commandant Zou Jing. Jing brought them to Liu Yan, governor of Youzhou, before whom the brothers gave account of 
    themselves. When Xuande mentioned his royal surname, the governor was delighted and acknowledged him as a nephew. 

    Some days later it was reported that the Yellow Scarves chieftain Cheng Yuanzhi was advancing on Zhuo district with fifty thousand men. The governor had Commandant Zou Jing lead the brothers 
    and their five hundred against the enemy. Eagerly, Xuande took his company to the base of Daxing Mountain where he encountered the rebels, who as always appeared with hair unbound and 
    yellow scarves across their foreheads. 

    The two forces stood opposed. Xuande rode out, Lord Guan to his left, Zhang Fei to his right. Raising his whip, Xuande cried out, "Traitors to the Emperor, surrender now!" Enraged, Cheng Yuanzhi 
    sent his subordinate commander Deng Mao into the field. Zhang Fei sped out, leveled his eighteen-span serpent-headed spear and jabbed his adversary through the chest. Seeing Deng Mao tumble 
    dead from his horse, Yuanzhi cut toward Zhang Fei, slapping his mount and flourishing his blade. Lord Guan swung out his mighty sword and, giving his horse free rein, rushed the foe. Cheng 
    Yuanzhi gulped with fright and, before he could defend himself, was sliced in two with a stroke of Lord Guan's weapon. A poet of later times praised the two warriors: 

    Oh, what a day for gallantry unveiled! 

    One man proved his lance and one his blade. 

    In maiden trial their martial force was shown. 

    A thrice-torn land will see them gain renown. 

    Their leaders slain, the rebels dropped their spears and fled. Xuande pursued, taking more prisoners than could be counted, and the brothers returned triumphant. Governor Liu Yan met them 
    personally and rewarded their soldiers. The next day Liu Yan received an appeal from Governor Gong Jing to relieve the rebel-besieged city of Qingzhou. Xuande volunteered to go there, and Liu 
    Yan ordered Zou Jing to join him and his brothers with five thousand men. As the rescue force approached Qingzhou, the Yellow Scarves divided their army and tied up the government troops in a 
    tangled struggle. Xuande's fewer numbers could not prevail, and he had to retreat some thirty //where he pitched camp. "They are too many for us. We can win only by surprising them," Xuande told 
    his brothers. He had Lord Guan and Zhang Fei march off with one thousand men each and conceal themselves along both sides of a hill. 

    The following day Xuande and Zou Jing advanced noisily but drew back when the enemy gave battle. The rebel horde eagerly pursued, but as they passed the hill the gongs rang out in unison. From 
    left and right, troops poured down as Xuande swung his soldiers around to resume combat. Squeezed between three forces, the rebels broke up and were driven to the very walls of Qingzhou where 
    an armed populace led by Governor Gong Jing met them. After a period of slaughter the Scarves were routed and the siege of Qingzhou was lifted. In later times a poet praised Xuande: 

    Seasoned plans and master moves; all's divinely done. 

    To one mighty dragon two tigers can't compare. 

    At his first trial what victories are won! 

    Poor orphan boy? The realm is his to share. 

    After the governor had feasted the troops, Commandant Zou Jing wanted to return to Youzhou. But Xuande said, "We have word that Imperial Corps Commander Lu Zhi has been battling the rebel 
    chief Zhang Jue at Guangzong. Lu Zhi was once my teacher, and I'd like to help him." So Zou Jing returned to Youzhou with his men, and Xuande headed for Guangzong with his brothers and their 
    five hundred men. They entered Lu Zhi's tent and, after the customary salutations, explained their purpose in coming. 

    Lu Zhi rejoiced at the arrival of this relief and took the brothers under his command. At this time Zhang Jue's one hundred and fifty thousand and Lu Zhi's fifty thousand were deadlocked at 
    Guangzong. "We have them contained here," Lu Zhi said to Xuande, "but over in Yingchuan, Zhang Jue's two brothers, Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, are holding out against our generals Huangfu 
    Song and Zhu Jun. Let me add one thousand to your company. Then go and investigate the situation there and fix the time to sweep the rebels out." On Lu Zhi's order, Xuande rode through the night 
    to Yingchuan. 

    Meanwhile, checked by Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun, the Yingchuan rebels had retreated to Changshe, where they hastily built a campsite near a field. "If they're by a field," General Huangfu Song 
    said to Zhu Jun, "we should attack with fire." They ordered each soldier to lie in wait with unlit torches of straw. That night the wind rose. After the second watch the government soldiers burned the 
    camp.2? Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun attacked the rebels' stockade as flames stretched skyward. Without saddling their horses or buckling their armor, the rebels fled panic-stricken in every direction. 
    The slaughter continued until morning. 

    Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao were in full flight when their fire-decimated forces were intercepted by a contingent of men with red flags flying. The leader of this new unit flashed into sight—tall, narrow¬ 
    eyed, with a long beard. This man's rank was cavalry commander. His surname was Cao; his given name, Cao; his style, Mengde. Cao Cao's father, Cao Song, was originally not a Cao but a Xiahou. 
    However, as the adopted son of the eunuch Cao Teng he assumed the surname Cao. Cao Song was Cao Cao's natural father. In addition, Cao Cao had the childhood nickname Ah Man and another 
    given name, Jili.s 

    As a youth Cao had loved the hunt and delighted in song and dance. He was a boy with ingenious ideas for any situation, a regular storehouse of schemes and machinations. Once Cao's uncle, 
    outraged by his nephew's wild antics, complained to Cao's father, who in turn reproached Cao. The next time the boy saw his uncle, he dropped to the ground and pretended to have a fit. The 
    terrified uncle fetched the father, who rushed to his son's side only to find him perfectly sound. "Your uncle told me you'd had a fit," said Song. "Has it passed?" 

    "Nothing of the sort ever happened," responded Cao. "My uncle accuses me of everything because I have lost favour with him." 

    The father believed the son and thereafter ignored the uncle's complaints, leaving Cao free to indulge his whims .22 At about that time a man called Qiao Xuan said to Cao, "The Empire is near ruin 
    and can be saved only by a man capable of dominating the age. You could be the one." On another occasion He Yu of Nanyang said of Cao Cao, "The house of Han is going to fail. Yet I feel certain 
    this is the man to steady the realm." In Runan a man named Xu Shao, known for his insight into human character, refused to give Cao a reading. But pressed repeatedly, the man finally spoke: "You 
    could be an able statesman in a time of peace or a treacherous villain in a time of chaos." This prediction pleased Cao immensely. 

    At twenty, Cao received his district's recommendation for filial devotion and personal integrity, and this led to his initial appointment to the palace. Later, he was given command of security in the 
    northern half of the district where the capital, Luoyang, was located. On assuming office he had a dozen decorated cudgels placed at the four gates of the city. They were to be a sign that any violator 
    of the laws, however high or mighty, would be punished. One night the uncle of the eunuch Jian Shuo was seen going through the streets carrying a broadsword. Cao, making his nightly rounds, 
    apprehended him and had one of the bludgeons applied. Thereafter no one dared to break the laws, and Cao Cao's prestige increased. Later he was made magistrate of Dunqiu. 

    During the Yellow Scarves uprisings the court elevated Cao to the rank of cavalry commander, and it was in this capacity that he led five thousand mounted warriors and foot soldiers to the 
    Yingchuan district. He encountered the routed troops of Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao and cut off their retreat. In the ensuing fray his men took ten thousand heads as well as flags, banners, gongs, 
    drums, and horses in large numbers. Zhang Liang and Zhang Bao, however, managed to escape after a desperate struggle. Cao presented himself to Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun, the imperial field 
    generals, and then went after the two rebel leaders.5i 

    • • • • 

    Meanwhile Xuande and his brothers neared Yingchuan, hurrying toward the roar of battle and the glowing night horizon. They reached the scene only to find the rebels already scattered. Xuande 
    presented himself to Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun and explained why Lu Zhi had sent him. "Zhang Jue's two brothers are done for by now," said Huangfu Song. "They'll be taking refuge with Jue at 
    Guangzong. That's where you are needed." Xuande accepted the order and led his men back. En route they came upon some soldiers escorting a cage-cart holding none other than Lu Zhi as 
    prisoner. Amazed to find under arrest the commander whom he so recently had been serving, Xuande dismounted and asked what the matter was. "I had Zhang Jue surrounded and nearly 
    defeated," Lu Zhi explained, "when he prevented our victory by some kind of magic. The court sent the eunuch Zuo Feng from the Inner Bureau to investigate. He was only looking to get paid off, but 
    I told him that with supplies exhausted we had nothing to spare for the imperial envoy. My refusal only angered him. He bore the grudge back to court and reported that I was weakening morale by 
    keeping on the defensive and not engaging the enemy. The court sent Imperial Corps Commander Dong Zhuo to relieve me and return me to the capital to face charges." 

    Outraged by this treatment of Xuande's former teacher, Zhang Fei moved to cut down the guard and rescue the prisoner. But Xuande checked him. "The court will see to it that justice is done" he 
    said. "Better not art rashly." They let the escort pass. "With Lu Zhi arrested and replaced," said Lord Guan, "we have nowhere to go but back to Zhuo district." Xuande agreed and began marching 
    north. But on the next day they heard a great tumult beyond a hill. Xuande and his brothers climbed to high ground. A beaten Han army came into their view. Behind it, hill and dale swarmed with 
    Yellow Scarves bearing banners that read "Heavenly Commander." 

    "Zhang Jue himself!" cried Xuande. "Let's attack at once."s 

    The three brothers swung their men into fighting position just as Zhang Jue was beating down the forces of Dong Zhuo, Lu Zhi's replacement as Imperial Corps commander. Carried by their 
    momentum, the rebels drove hard until they ran up against the brothers. A murderous clash followed. Jue's men were thrown into confusion and had to retreat more than fifty //. The brothers rescued 
    Dong Zhuo and saw him back to his camp. Zhuo inquired what offices they held but, upon learning that they were commoners without position, disdainfully refused to acknowledge their services The 
    three started to leave the camp with Zhang Fei grumbling, "Is that how the wretch treats us for risking our lives to save him? Then I'll have another kind of satisfaction!" Bent on revenge, Zhang Fei 
    turned and stamped back toward Dong Zhuo's headquarters, a sword in his hand. It was a case where, indeed:

    PROVING ONESELF: The ambitious scramble as one starts to make their way in a chaotic world rich with opportunity. Proving oneself is the act of defining one's personality while building a reputation through meritorious deeds and triumph in the face of difficult odds — the rush of success, the happiness at making progress towards one's goals, and the elation and confidence brought on by overcoming challenges, are what characterizes this emotion. People prove themselves each in their own ways. Some do it with will, courage, and talent; others through wit, schemes, and antics; but all who are heroes of their time test themselves against the mettle of opposition and emerge victorious. Overcoming great adversity, building one's position, and seizing opportunity, are the true pleasures of the heroes (and villains) who define ages. Moving from one great task to another with confidence and ability, building an unstoppable momentum, is perhaps one of the greatest feelings in the world. And seldom do the ambitious fail to find a new goal once their first is achieved.
