    "answer": "The author suggests that the law prohibiting incest is ultimately a form of coercion towards domestication. Religious systems, in this context, are seen as institutions that first receive, then organize, and gradually sublimate the raw, animal instincts and forces that are not immediately useful or culturally acceptable.",
