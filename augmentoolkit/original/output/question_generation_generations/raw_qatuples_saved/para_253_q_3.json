    "paragraph": "Horses also signify fire and light. The fiery horses of Helios are an example. The horses of Hector are called Xanthos (yellow, bright), Podargos (swift-footed), Lampos (shining) and Aithon (burning). A very pronounced fire symbolism was represented by the mystic Quadriga, mentioned by Dio Chrysostomus. The supreme God always drives his chariot in a circle. Four horses are harnessed to the chariot. The horse driven on the periphery moves very quickly. He has a shining coat, and bears upon it the signs of the planets and the Zodiac.[589] This is a representation of the rotary fire of heaven. The second horse moves more slowly, and is illuminated only on one side. The third moves still more slowly, and the fourth rotates around himself. But once the outer horse set the second horse on fire with his fiery breath, and the third flooded the fourth with his streaming sweat. Then the horses dissolve and pass over into the substance of the strongest and most fiery, which now becomes the charioteer. The horses also represent the four elements. The catastrophe signifies the conflagration of the world and the deluge, whereupon the division of the God into many parts ceases, and the divine unity is restored.[590] Doubtless the Quadriga may be understood astronomically as a _symbol of time_. We already saw in the first part that the stoic representation of Fate is a fire symbol. It is, therefore, a logical continuation of the thought, when time, closely related to the conception of destiny, exhibits this same libido symbolism. Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad, i: 1, says:",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the horses' roles in the catastrophic events described?\n\n**ANSAR:**\nThe text implies that the horses play a significant role in catastrophic events, such as the conflagration of the world and the deluge. These events signify the end of a division of the God into many parts and the restoration of divine unity. The interaction between the horses, such as the outer horse setting the second horse on fire and the third flooding the fourth with streaming sweat, represents the symbolic culmination of these events.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the Quadriga relate to the concept of time and destiny according to the text?",
    "answer": "The Quadriga is understood as a symbol of time, reflecting the astrological and cosmic representation of time. The text links this symbol of time to the Stoic representation of Fate, which is a fire symbol. Therefore, the Quadriga serves as a logical continuation of the thought, where time, closely related to the conception of destiny, exhibits the same libido symbolism.",
