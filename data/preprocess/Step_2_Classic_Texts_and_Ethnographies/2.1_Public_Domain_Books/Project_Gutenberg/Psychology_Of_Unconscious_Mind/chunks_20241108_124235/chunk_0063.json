Distinct traces of the\nprimitive identity of serpent and hero are still extant in the myth of\nCecrops. Cecrops is himself half-snake, half-man. Originally, he\nprobably was the Athenian snake of the citadel itself. As a buried god,\nhe is like Erechtheus, a chthonic snake god. Above his subterranean\ndwelling rises the Parthenon, the temple of the virgin goddess (compare\nthe analogous idea of the Christian church). The casting of the skin of\nthe god, which we have already mentioned in passing, stands in the\nclosest relation to the nature of the hero. We have spoken already of\nthe Mexican god who casts his skin. It is also told of Mani, the founder\nof the Manichaean sect, that he was killed, skinned, stuffed and hung\nup.[775] That is the death of Christ, merely in another mythological\nform.[776]\n\nMarsyas, who seems to be a substitute for Attis, the son-lover of\nCybele, was also skinned.[777] Whenever a Scythian king died, slaves and\nhorses were slaughtered, skinned and stuffed, and then set up\nagain.[778] In Phrygia, the representatives of the father-god were\nkilled and skinned. The same was done in Athens with an ox, who was\nskinned and stuffed and again hitched to the plough.\n\nIn this manner the revival of the fertility of the earth was\ncelebrated.[779]\n\nThis readily explains the fragment from the Sabazios mysteries,\ntransmitted to us by Firmicus:[780] Ταῦρος δράκοντος καὶ πατὴρ ταύρου\nδράκων[781].\n\nThe active fructifying (upward striving) form of the libido is changed\ninto the negative force striving downwards towards death. The hero as\nzodion of spring (ram, bull) conquers the depths of winter; and beyond\nthe summer solstice is attacked by the unconscious longing for death,\nand is bitten by the snake. However, he himself is the snake. But he is\nat war with himself, and, therefore, the descent and the end appear to\nhim as the malicious inventions of the mother of death, who in this way\nwishes to draw him to herself. The mysteries, however, consolingly\npromise that there is no contradiction[782] or disharmony when life is\nchanged into death: ταῦρος δράκοντος καὶ πατήρ ταύρου δράκων.\n\nNietzsche, too, gives expression to this mystery:[783]\n\n               “_Here do I sit now_,\n               That is, I’m swallowed down\n               By this the smallest oasis—\n               —It opened up just yawning,\n               Its loveliest maw agape.\n               Hail! hail! to that whalefish,\n               When he for his guests’ welfare\n               Provided thus!\n\n                      ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n               Hail to his belly\n               If he had also\n               Such a lovely oasis belly—\n               The desert grows, woe to him\n               Who hides the desert!\n               Stone grinds on stone, the desert\n               Gulps and strangles.\n               The monstrous death gazes, glowing brown,\n               And chews—his life is his chewing ...\n               Forget not, O man, burnt out by lust,\n               Thou art the stone, the desert,\n               Thou art death!”\n\nThe serpent symbolism of the Last Supper is explained by the\nidentification of the hero with the serpent: The god is buried in the\nmother: as fruit of the field, as food coming from the mother and at the\nsame time as drink of immortality he is received by the mystic, or as a\nserpent he unites with the mystic. All these symbols represent the\nliberation of the libido from the incestuous fixation through which new\nlife is attained. The liberation is accomplished under symbols, which\nrepresent the activity of the incest wish.\n\nIt might be justifiable at this place to cast a glance upon\npsychoanalysis as a method of treatment. In practical analysis it is\nimportant, first of all, to discover the libido lost from the control of\nconsciousness. (It often happens to the libido as with the fish of Moses\nin the Mohammedan legend; it sometimes “takes its course in a marvellous\nmanner into the sea.”) Freud says in his important article, “Zur Dynamik\nder Übertragung”:[784]\n\n  “The libido has retreated into regression and again revives the\n  infantile images.”\n\nThis means, mythologically, that the sun is devoured by the serpent of\nthe night, the treasure is concealed and guarded by the dragon:\nsubstitution of a present mode of adaptation by an infantile mode, which\nis represented by the corresponding neurotic symptoms. Freud continues:\n\n  “Thither the analytic treatment follows it and endeavors to seek out\n  the libido again, to render it accessible to consciousness, and\n  finally to make it serviceable to reality. Whenever the analytic\n  investigation touches upon the libido, withdrawn into its\n  hiding-place, a struggle must break out; all the forces, which have\n  caused the regression of the libido, will rise up as resistance\n  against the work, in order to preserve this new condition.”\n\nMythologically this means: the hero seeks the lost sun, the fire, the\nvirgin sacrifice, or the treasure, and fights the typical fight with the\ndragon, with the libido in resistance. As these parallels show,\npsychoanalysis mobiles a part of the life processes, the fundamental\nimportance of which properly illustrates the significance of this\nprocess.\n\nAfter Siegfried has slain the dragon, he meets the father, Wotan,\nplagued by gloomy cares, for the primitive mother, Erda, has placed in\nhis path the snake, in order to enfeeble his sun. He says to Erda:\n\n               _Wanderer_:\n\n               All-wise one,\n               Care’s piercing sting by thee was planted\n               In Wotan’s dauntless heart\n               With fear of shameful ruin and downfall.\n               Filled was his spirit by tidings\n               Thou didst foretell.\n               Art thou the world’s wisest of women?\n               Tell to me now\n               How a god may conquer his care.\n\n               _Erda_:\n\n               Thou art not\n               What thou hast said.\n\nIt is the same primitive motive which we meet Wagner: the mother has\nrobbed her son, the sun-god, of the joy of life, through a poisonous\nthorn, and deprives him of his power, which is connected with the name.\nIsis demands the name of the god; Erda says, “Thou art not what thou\nhast said.” But the “Wanderer” has found the way to conquer the fatal\ncharm of the mother, the fear of death:\n\n                  “The eternals’ downfall\n                  No more dismays me,\n                  Since their doom I willed.\n\n                  “I leave to thee, loveliest Wälsung,\n                  Gladly my heritage now.\n                  To the ever-young\n                  In gladness yieldeth the god!”\n\nThese wise words contain, in fact, the saving thought. It is not the\nmother who has placed the poisonous worm in our path, but our libido\nitself wills to complete the course of the sun to mount from morn to\nnoon, and, passing beyond noon, to hasten towards evening, not at war\nwith itself, but willing the descent and the end.[785]\n\nNietzsche’s Zarathustra teaches:\n\n  “I praise thee, my death, the free death, which comes to me because I\n  want it.\n\n  “And when shall I want it?\n\n  “He who has a goal and an heir wants death at the proper time for his\n  goal and his heir.\n\n  “And this is the great noonday, when man in the middle of his course\n  stands between man and superman, and celebrates his path towards\n  evening as his highest hope: because it is the path to a new morning.\n\n  “He who is setting will bless his own going down because it is a\n  transition: and the sun of his knowledge will be at high noon.”\n\nSiegfried conquers the father Wotan and takes possession of Brunhilde.\nThe first object that he sees is her horse; then he believes that he\nbeholds a mail-clad man. He cuts to pieces the protecting coat of mail\nof the sleeper. (Overpowering.) When he sees it is a woman, terror\nseizes him:\n\n                  “My heart doth falter and faint;\n                  On whom shall I call\n                  That he may help me?\n                  Mother! Mother!\n                  Remember me!\n\n                  “Can this be fearing?\n                  Oh, mother! Mother!\n                  Thy dauntless child!\n                  A woman lieth asleep:—\n                  And she now has taught him to fear!\n\n                  “Awaken! Awaken!\n                  Holiest maid!\n                  Then life from the sweetness of lips\n                  Will I win me—\n                  E’en tho’ I die in a kiss.”\n\nIn the duet which follows the mother is invoked:\n\n                       “O mother, hail!\n                       Who gave thee thy birth!”\n\nThe confession of Brunhilde is especially characteristic:\n\n                   “O knewest thou—joy of the world,\n                   How I have ever loved thee!\n                   Thou wert my gladness,\n                   My care wert thou!\n                   Thy life I sheltered;\n                   Or ere it was thine,\n                   Or ere thou wert born,\n                   My shield was thy guard.”[786]\n\nThe pre-existence of the hero and the pre-existence of Brunhilde as his\nwife-mother are clearly indicated from this passage.\n\nSiegfried says in confirmation:\n\n                    “Then death took not my mother?\n                    Bound in sleep did she lie?”\n\nThe mother-imago, which is the symbol of the dying and resurrected\nlibido, is explained by Brunhilde to the hero, as his own will:\n\n                      “Thyself am I\n                      If blest I be in thy love.”\n\nThe great mystery of the Logos entering into the mother for rebirth is\nproclaimed with the following words by Brunhilde:\n\n                   “O Siegfried, Siegfried,\n                   Conquering light!\n                   I loved thee ever,\n                   For I divined\n                   The thought that Wotan had hidden—\n                   The thought that I dared\n                   Not to whisper—[787]\n                   That all unclearly\n                   Glowed in my bosom\n                   Suffered and strove;\n                   For which I flouted\n                   Him, who conceived it:[787]\n                   For which in penance\n                   Prisoned I lay,\n                   While thinking it not\n                   And feeling only,\n                   For, in my thought,\n                   Oh, should you guess it?\n                   Was only my love for thee.”\n\nThe erotic similes which now follow distinctly reveal the motive of\nrebirth:\n\n                   _Siegfried_:\n                     “A glorious flood\n                     Before me rolls.\n                     With all my senses\n                     I only see\n                     Its buoyant, gladdening billows.\n                     Though in the deep\n                     I find not my face,\n                     Burning, I long\n                     For the water’s balm;\n                     And now as I am,\n                     Spring in the stream.[788]\n                     O might its billows\n                     Engulf me in bliss.”\n\nThe motive of plunging into the maternal water of rebirth (baptism) is\nhere fully developed. An allusion to the “terrible mother” imago, the\nmother of heroes, who teaches them fear, is to be found in Brunhilde’s\nwords (the horse-woman, who guides the dead to the other side):\n\n                       “Fearest thou, Siegfried?\n                       Fearest thou not\n                       The wild, furious woman?”\n\nThe orgiastic “Occide moriturus” resounds in Brunhilde’s words:\n\n                      “Laughing let us be lost—\n                      Laughing go down to death!”\n\nAnd in the words\n\n                          “Light-giving love,\n                          Laughing death!”\n\nis to be found the same significant contrast.\n\nThe further destinies of Siegfried are those of the Invictus: the spear\nof the gloomy, one-eyed Hagen strikes Siegfried’s vulnerable spot. The\nold sun, who has become the god of death, the one-eyed Wotan, smites his\noffspring, and once again ascends in eternal rejuvenation. The course of\nthe invincible sun has supplied the mystery of human life with beautiful\nand imperishable symbols; it became a comforting fulfilment of all the\nyearning for immortality, of all desire of mortals for eternal life.",
