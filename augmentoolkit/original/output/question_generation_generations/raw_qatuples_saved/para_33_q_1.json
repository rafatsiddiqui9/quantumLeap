    "paragraph": "Thus like the leviathan! We recall this overpowering weight in the scale of God\u2019s justice in regard to the man Job. There, where the deep sources of the ocean are, the leviathan lives; from there the all-destroying flood ascends, the all-engulfing flood of animal passion. That stifling, compressing feeling[203] of the onward-surging impulse is projected mythologically as a flood which, rising up and over all, destroys all that exists, in order to allow a new and better creation to come forth from this destruction._Japhet_:The eternal will      Shall deign to expound this dream      Of good and evil; and redeem      Unto himself all times, all things;And, gather\u2019d under his almighty wings,      Abolish hell!      And to the expiated Earth      Restore the beauty of her birth._Spirits_:And when shall take effect this wondrous spell?_Japhet_:When the Redeemer cometh; first in pain      And then in glory._Spirits_:New times, new climes, new arts, new men, but still      The same old tears, old crimes, and oldest ill,      Shall be amongst your race in different forms;      But the same mortal storms      Shall oversweep the future, as the waves      In a few hours the glorious giants\u2019 graves.The prophetic visions of Japhet have almost prophetic meaning for our poetess; with the death of the moth in the light, evil is once more laid aside; the complex has once again, even if in a censored form, expressed itself. With that, however, the problem is not solved; all sorrow and every longing begins again from the beginning, but there is \u201cPromise in the Air\u201d\u2014the premonition of the Redeemer, of the \u201cWell-beloved,\u201d of the Sun-hero, who again mounts to the height of the sun and again descends to the coldness of the winter, who is the light of hope from race to race, the image of the libido.PART II",

    "question": "What does Japhet prophesize about the future in the text?",
    "answer": "Japhet prophesizes that the future will bring new times, new climes, new arts, and new men, but these will still be accompanied by the same old tears, crimes, and fundamental ills. He also suggests that the same mortal storms will continue to oversweep the future, much like waves that erase the graves of the ancient giants.",
