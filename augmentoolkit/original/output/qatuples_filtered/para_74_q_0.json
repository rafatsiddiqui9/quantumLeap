    "paragraph": "theoretically, from the standpoint of the Freudian theory of libido. If Abraham believes that through the withdrawal of the libido from the outer world the paranoid system or the schizophrenic symptomatology results, then this assumption is not justified from the standpoint of the knowledge of that time, because a mere libido introversion and regression leads, speedily, as Freud has clearly shown, into the neuroses, and, strictly speaking, into the transference neuroses, and not into dementia pr\u00e6cox. Therefore, the transference of the libido theory to dementia pr\u00e6cox is impossible, because this illness produces a loss of reality which cannot be explained by the deficiency of the libido defined in this narrow sense.",

    "answer": "According to Freudian theory, the withdrawal of libido from the outer world leads to neuroses, specifically transference neuroses. This is because a mere introversion of libido and regression typically results in neurotic conditions rather than the more severe symptoms of dementia pr\u00e6cox.",
