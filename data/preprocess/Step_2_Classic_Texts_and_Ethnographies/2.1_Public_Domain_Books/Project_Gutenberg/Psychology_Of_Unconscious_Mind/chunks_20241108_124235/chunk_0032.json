  "original_text": "I am indebted to Freud for a further important reference to the\nonanistic nature of the fire theft, or rather the motive of _the\ntreasure difficult of attainment_ (to which fire theft belongs).\nMythology contains repeated formulas which read approximately as\nfollows: The treasure must be plucked or torn off from a taboo tree\n(Paradise tree, Hesperides); this is a forbidden and dangerous act. The\nclearest example of this is the old barbaric custom in the service of\nDiana of Aricia: only he can become a priest of the goddess who, in her\nsacred grove, dares to tear off (“abzureissen”) a bough. The tearing off\nhas been retained in vulgar speech (besides “abreiben,” rubbing) as a\nsymbol of the act of onanism. Thus “reiben,” to rub, is like “reissen,”\nto break off, both of which are contained in manthami and united\napparently only through the myth of the fire theft bound up in the act\nof onanism in a deeper stratum wherein “reiben,” properly speaking,\n“reissen,” is employed, but in a transferred sense. Therefore, it might\nperhaps be anticipated that in the deepest stratum, namely, the\nincestuous, which precedes the autoerotic stage,[340] the two meanings\ncoincide, which, through lack of mythological tradition, can perhaps be\ntraced through etymology only.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IV\n                   THE UNCONSCIOUS ORIGIN OF THE HERO\n\n\nPrepared by the previous chapters, we approach the personification of\nthe libido in the form of a conqueror, a hero or a demon. With this,\nsymbolism leaves the impersonal and neuter realm, which characterizes\nthe astral and meteorologic symbol, and takes human form: the figure of\na being changing from sorrow to joy, from joy to sorrow, and which, like\nthe sun, sometimes stands in its zenith, sometimes is plunged in darkest\nnight, and arises from this very night to new splendor.[341] Just as the\nsun, guided by its own internal laws, ascends from morn till noon, and\npassing beyond the noon descends towards evening, leaving behind its\nsplendor, and then sinks completely into the all-enveloping night, thus,\ntoo, does mankind follow his course according to immutable laws, and\nalso sinks, after his course is completed, into night, in order to rise\nagain in the morning to a new cycle in his children. The symbolic\ntransition from sun to man is easy and practicable. The third and last\ncreation of Miss Miller’s also takes this course. She calls this piece\n“Chiwantopel,” a “hypnagogic poem.” She gives us the following\ninformation about the circumstances surrounding the origin of this\nphantasy:\n\n  “After an evening of care and anxiety, I lay down to sleep at about\n  half past eleven. I felt excited and unable to sleep, although I was\n  very tired. There was no light in the room. I closed my eyes, and then\n  I had the feeling that something was about to happen. The sensation of\n  a general relaxation came over me, and I remained as passive as\n  possible. Lines appeared before my eyes,—sparks and shining spirals,\n  followed by a kaleidoscopic review of recent trivial occurrences.”\n\nThe reader will regret with me that we cannot know the reason for her\ncares and anxieties. It would have been of great importance for what\nfollows to have information on this point. This gap in our knowledge is\nthe more to be deplored because, between the first poem in 1898 and the\ntime of the phantasy here discussed (1902), four whole years have\npassed. All information is lacking regarding this period, during which\nthe great problem surely survived in the unconscious. Perhaps this lack\nhas its advantages in that our interest is not diverted from the\nuniversal applicability of the phantasy here produced by sympathy in\nregard to the personal fate of the author. Therefore, something is\nobviated which often prevents the analyst in his daily task from looking\naway from the tedious toil of detail to that wider relation which\nreveals each neurotic conflict to be involved with human fate as a\nwhole.\n\nThe condition depicted by the author here corresponds to such a one as\nusually precedes an intentional somnambulism[342] often described by\nspiritualistic mediums. A certain inclination to listen to these low\nnocturnal voices must be assumed; otherwise such fine and hardly\nperceptible inner experiences pass unnoticed. We recognize in this\nlistening a current of the libido leading inward and beginning to flow\ntowards a still invisible, mysterious goal. It seems that the libido has\nsuddenly discovered an object in the depths of the unconscious which\npowerfully attracts it. The life of man, turned wholly to the external\nby nature, does not ordinarily permit such introversion; there must,\ntherefore, be surmised a certain exceptional condition, that is to say,\na lack of external objects, which compels the individual to seek a\nsubstitute for them in his own soul. It is, however, difficult to\nimagine that this rich world has become too poor to offer an object for\nthe love of human atoms; nor can the world and its objects be held\naccountable for this lack. It offers boundless opportunities for every\none. It is rather the _incapacity to love which robs mankind of his\npossibilities_. This world is empty to him alone who does not understand\nhow to direct his libido towards objects, and to render them alive and\nbeautiful for himself, for Beauty does not indeed lie in things, but in\nthe feeling that we give to them. That which compels us to create a\nsubstitute for ourselves is not the external lack of objects, but our\nincapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of ourselves. Certainly\nthe difficulties of the conditions of life and the adversities of the\nstruggle for existence may oppress us, yet even adverse external\nsituations would not hinder the giving out of the libido; on the\ncontrary, they may spur us on to the greatest exertions, whereby we\nbring our whole libido into reality. Real difficulties alone will never\nbe able to force the libido back permanently to such a degree as to give\nrise, for example, to a neurosis. _The conflict, which is the condition\nof every neurosis, is lacking._ The resistance, which opposes its\nunwillingness to the will, alone has the power to produce that\npathogenic introversion which is the starting point of every psychogenic\ndisturbance. The resistance against loving produces the inability to\nlove. Just as the normal libido is comparable to a steady stream which\npours its waters broadly into the world of reality, so the resistance,\ndynamically considered, is comparable, not so much to a rock rearing up\nin the river bed which is flooded over or surrounded by the stream, as\nto a backward flow towards the source. A part of the soul desires the\nouter object; another part, however, harks back to the subjective world,\nwhere the airy and fragile palaces of phantasy beckon. One can assume\nthe dualism of the human will for which Bleuler, from the psychiatric\npoint of view, has coined the word “ambitendency”[343] as something\ngenerally present, bearing in mind that even the most primitive motor\nimpulse is in opposition; as, for example, in the act of extension, the\nflexor muscles also become innervated. This normal ambitendency,\nhowever, never leads to an inhibition or prevention of the intended act,\nbut is the indispensable preliminary requirement for its perfection and\ncoördination. For a resistance disturbing to this act to arise from this\nharmony of finely attuned opposition an abnormal plus or minus would be\nneeded on one or the other side. The resistance originates from this\nadded third.[344] This applies also to the duality of the will, from\nwhich so many difficulties arise for mankind. The abnormal third frees\nthe pair of opposites, which are normally most intimately united, and\ncauses their manifestation in the form of separate tendencies; it is\nonly thus that they become willingness and unwillingness, which\ninterfere with each other. The Bhagavad-Gîtâ says, “Be thou free of the\npairs of opposites.”[345] The harmony thus becomes disharmony. It cannot\nbe my task here to investigate whence the unknown third arises, and what\nit is. Taken at the roots in the case of our patients, the “nuclear\ncomplex” (Freud) reveals itself as the _incest problem_. The sexual\nlibido regressing to the parents appears as the incest tendency. The\nreason this path is so easily travelled is due to the enormous indolence\nof mankind, which will relinquish no object of the past, but will hold\nit fast forever. The “sacrilegious backward grasp” of which Nietzsche\nspeaks reveals itself, stripped of its incest covering, as an original\npassive arrest of the libido in its first object of childhood. This\nindolence is also a passion, as La Rochefoucauld[346] has brilliantly\nexpressed it:\n\n  “Of all passions, that which is least known to ourselves is indolence:\n  it is the most ardent and malignant of them all, although its violence\n  may be insensible, and the injuries it causes may be hidden; if we\n  will consider its power attentively, we will see that it makes itself,\n  upon all occasions, mistress of our sentiments, of our interests, and\n  of our pleasures; it is the anchor, which has the power to arrest the\n  largest vessels; it is a calm more dangerous to the most important\n  affairs than rocks and the worst tempest. The repose of indolence is a\n  secret charm of the soul which suddenly stops the most ardent pursuits\n  and the firmest resolutions; finally to give the true idea of this\n  passion, one must say that indolence is like a beatitude of the soul\n  which consoles it for all its losses and takes the place of all its\n  possessions.”\n\nThis dangerous passion, belonging above all others to primitive man,\nappears under the hazardous mask of the incest symbol, from which the\nincest fear must drive us away, and which must be conquered, in the\nfirst place, under the image of the “terrible mother.”[347] It is the\nmother of innumerable evils, not the least of which are neurotic\ntroubles. For, especially from the fogs of the arrested remnants of the\nlibido, arise the harmful phantasmagoria which so veil reality that\nadaptation becomes almost impossible. However, we will not investigate\nany further in this place the foundations of the incest phantasies. The\npreliminary suggestion of my purely psychologic conception of the incest\nproblem may suffice. We are here only concerned with the question\nwhether _resistance_ which leads to introversion in our author signifies\na conscious external difficulty or not. If it were an external\ndifficulty, then, indeed, the libido would be violently dammed back, and\nwould produce a flood of phantasies, which can best be designated as\nschemes, that is to say, plans as to how the obstacles could be\novercome. They would be very concrete ideas of reality which seek to\npave the way for solutions. It would be a strenuous meditation, indeed,\nwhich would be more likely to lead to anything rather than to a\nhypnagogic poem. The passive condition depicted above in no way fits in\nwith a real external obstacle, but, precisely through its passive\nsubmission, it indicates a tendency which doubtless scorns real\nsolutions and prefers phantastic substitutes. Ultimately and essentially\nwe are, therefore, dealing with an internal conflict, perhaps after the\nmanner of those earlier conflicts which led to the two first unconscious\ncreations. We, therefore, are forced to conclude that the external\nobject cannot be loved, because a predominant amount of libido prefers a\nphantastic object, which must be brought up from the depths of the\nunconscious as a compensation for the missing reality.\n\nThe visionary phenomena, produced in the first stages of introversion,\nare grouped among the well-known phenomena[348] of hypnagogic vision.\nThey form, as I explained in an earlier paper, the foundation of the\ntrue visions of the symbolic autorevelations of the libido, as we may\nnow express it.\n\nMiss Miller continues:\n\n  “Then I had the impression that some communication was immediately\n  impending. It seemed to me as if there were re-echoed in me the words,\n  ‘Speak, O Lord, for Thy servant listens; open Thou mine ears!’”\n\nThis passage very clearly describes the intention; the expression\n“communication” is even a current term in spiritualistic circles. The\nBiblical words contain a clear invocation or “prayer,” that is to say, a\nwish (libido) directed towards divinity (the unconscious complex). The\nprayer refers to Samuel, i:3, where Samuel at night was three times\ncalled by God, but believed that it was Eli calling, until the latter\ninformed him that it was God himself who spoke, and that he must answer\nif his name was called again—“Speak, O Lord, for Thy Servant hears!” The\ndreamer uses these words really in an inverse sense, namely, in order to\nproduce God with them. With that she directs her desires, her libido,\ninto the depths of her unconscious.",
