    "paragraph": "influence; in older religions, it seems to be the influence of the mother transference which creates the attributes of the divinity. The attributes of the divinity are omnipotence, a sternly persecuting paternalism ruling through fear (Old Testament) and a loving paternalism (New Testament). These are the attributes of the libido in that wide sense in which Freud has conceived this idea empirically. In certain pagan and also in certain Christian attributes of divinity the maternal stands out strongly, and in the former the animal also comes into the greatest prominence.[81] Likewise, the infantile, so closely interwoven with religious phantasies, and from time to time breaking forth so violently, is nowhere lacking.[82] All this points to the sources of the dynamic states of religious activity. These are those impulses which in childhood are withdrawn from incestuous application through the intervention of the incest barrier and which, especially at the time of puberty, as a result of affluxes of libido coming from the still incompletely employed sexuality, are aroused to their own peculiar activity. As is easily understood, that which is valuable in the God-creating idea is not the form but the power, the libido. The primitive power which Job\u2019s Hymn of Creation vindicates, the unconditional and inexorable, the unjust and the superhuman, are truly and rightly attributes of libido, which \u201clead us unto life,\u201d which \u201clet the poor be guilty,\u201d and against which struggle is in vain. Nothing remains for mankind but to work in harmony with this will. Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cZarathustra\u201d teaches us this impressively.",

    "answer": "Maternal attributes in divinity are noticeable in both certain pagan and Christian contexts. Similarly, animal attributes also come into prominence in these contexts. This duality reflects the varied and complex influences on human psychology and religious beliefs.",
