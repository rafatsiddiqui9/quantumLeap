Causes of the Oedipus Problem

There are several theories as to why the Oedipus problem was created by Sophocles. Some scholars believe that it was inspired by ancient Greek myths and legends, while others argue that it was a commentary on the societal norms of the time.

One possible explanation is that the Oedipus problem was a way for Sophocles to explore the tension between fate and free will. Oedipus's actions are driven by a desire to uncover the truth about his past, but ultimately, he is unable to escape his fate.
