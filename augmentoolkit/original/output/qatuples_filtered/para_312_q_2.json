    "paragraph": "(Compare with this the remarks previously made about \u201cboys.\u201d) Because of this significance of the arrow it is intelligible why the Scythian king Ariantes, when he wished to prepare a census, demanded an arrow-head from each man. A similar meaning attaches equally to the lance. Men are descended from the lance, because the ash is the mother of lances. Therefore, the men of the Iron Age are derived from her. The marriage custom to which Ovid alludes (\u201cComat virgineas hasta recurva comas\u201d\u2014_Fastorum_, lib. ii: 560) has already been mentioned. Kaineus issued a command that his lance be honored. Pindar relates in the legend of this Kaineus:\u201cHe descended into the depths, splitting the earth with a straight  foot.\u201d[607]He is said to have originally been a maiden named Kainis, who, because of her complaisance, was transformed into an invulnerable man by Poseidon. Ovid pictures the battle of the Lapith\u00e6 with the invulnerable Kaineus; how at last they covered him completely with trees, because they could not otherwise touch him. Ovid says at this place:\u201cExitus in dubio est: alii sub inania corpus      Tartara detrusum silvarum mole ferebant,      Abnuit Ampycides: medioque ex aggere fulvis      Vidit avem pennis liquidas exire sub auras.\u201d[608]Roscher considers this bird to be the golden plover (Charadrius pluvialis), which borrows its name from the fact that it lives in the \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1, a crevice in the earth. By his song he proclaims the approaching rain. Kaineus was changed into this bird.",

    "question": "What legend is associated with Kaineus, and what transformation did he undergo?\n\n**ANS:** Kaineus is associated with a legend where he is originally a maiden named Kainis. She was transformed into an invulnerable man by Poseidon due to her complaisance. This transformation is significant as it attributes both a maidenly origin and invulnerability to Kaineus.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat battle is described in the context, and what unique characteristic did Kaineus have in this battle?",
    "answer": "The battle described is between the Lapithae and Kaineus. Kaineus was known for his invulnerability, which made it difficult for his opponents to harm him. To cover him completely with trees, the Lapithae resorted to this method, as they could not touch him otherwise due to his invulnerability.",
