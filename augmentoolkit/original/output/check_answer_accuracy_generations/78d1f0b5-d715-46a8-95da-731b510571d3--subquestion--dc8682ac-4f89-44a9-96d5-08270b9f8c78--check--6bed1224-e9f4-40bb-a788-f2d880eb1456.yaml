- content: 'Text: """The existence of the primitive coitus play or rite seems to me
    sufficiently proven. The only thing that is obscure is the energy and emphasis
    of the ritual play. It is well known that those primitive rites were often of
    very bloody seriousness, and were performed with an extraordinary display of energy,
    which appears as a great contrast to the well-known indolence of primitive humanity.
    Therefore, the ritual activity entirely loses the character of play, and wins
    that of purposeful effort. If certain Negro races can dance the whole night long
    to three tones in the most monotonous manner, then, according to our idea, there
    is in this an absolute lack of the character of play pastime; it approaches nearer
    to exercise. There seems to exist a sort of compulsion to transfer the libido
    into such ritual activity. If the basis of the ritual activity is the sexual act,
    we may assume that it is really the underlying thought and object of the exercise.
    Under these circumstances, the question arises why the primitive man endeavors
    to represent the sexual act symbolically and with effort, or, if this wording
    appears to be too hypothetical, why does he exert energy to such a degree only
    to accomplish practically useless things, which apparently do not especially amuse
    him?[308] It may be assumed that the sexual act is more desirable to primitive
    man than such absurd and, moreover, fatiguing exercises. It is hardly possible
    but that a certain compulsion conducts the energy away from the original object
    and real purpose, inducing the production of surrogates. The existence of a phallic
    or orgiastic cult does not indicate _eo ipso_ a particularly lascivious life any
    more than the ascetic symbolism of Christianity means an especially moral life.
