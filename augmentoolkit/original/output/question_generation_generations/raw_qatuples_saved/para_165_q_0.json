    "paragraph": "re-echo of an old-folk-belief, which was very widespread originally.[44] The ambitious phantasy chooses, among others, a form which is classic, and which once had a true meaning. The same thing holds good in regard to the sexual phantasy. In the preamble we have spoken of dreams of sexual assault: the robber who breaks into the house and commits a dangerous act. That, too, is a mythological theme, and in the prehistoric era was certainly a reality too.[45] Wholly apart from the fact that the capture of women was something general in the lawless prehistoric times, it was also a subject of mythology in cultivated epochs. I recall the capture of Proserpina, Deianira, Europa, the Sabine women, etc. We must not forget that, even to-day, marriage customs exist in various regions which recall the ancient custom of marriage by capture.",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the origins of certain fantasies and beliefs, and how does it relate to classic forms?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that certain fantasies and beliefs often re-echo old folk beliefs that were very widespread in the past. These fantasies and beliefs often take on classic forms that had true meanings in earlier times. This is similar to how sexual phantasies can include classic themes, such as a sexual assault scenario, which has roots in mythological and prehistoric realities.",
