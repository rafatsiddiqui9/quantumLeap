    certain people never relinquish the seeking for satisfaction in the shadowy world
    of phantasy and even though they make certain attempts at adaptation they are
    halted and discouraged by every difficulty and obstacle in the path of life and
    are easily pulled back into their inner psychic world. This condition is called
    a state of _introversion_. It is concerned with the past and the reminiscences
    which belong thereto. Situations and experiences which should have been completed
    and finished long ago are still dwelt upon and lived with. Images and matters
    which were once important but which normally have no significance for their later
    age are still actively influencing their present lives. The nature and character
    of these phantasy products are legion, and are easily recognized in the emotional
    attitudes and pretensions, the childish illusions and exaggerations, the prejudices
    and inconsistencies which people express in manifold forms. The actual situation
    is inadequately faced; small matters are reacted towards in an exaggerated manner;
    or else a frivolous attitude is maintained where real seriousness is demanded.
    In other words, there is clearly manifested an inadequate psychic adaptation towards
    reality which is quite to be expected from the child, but which is very discordant
    in the adult.The most important of these past influences is that of the parents.
    Because they are the first objects of the developing childish love, and afford
