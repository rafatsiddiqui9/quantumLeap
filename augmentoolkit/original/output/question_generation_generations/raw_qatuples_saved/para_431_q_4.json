    "paragraph": "The infantile nourishment comes from the mother. In the Gnostic phantasies we come across a legend of the origin of man which possibly belongs here: the female archons bound to the vault of Heaven are unable, on account of its quick rotation, to keep their young within them, but let them fall upon the earth, from which men arise. Possibly there is here a connection with barbaric midwifery, the letting fall of the parturient. The assault upon the mother is already introduced with the adventure of Mudjekeewis, and is continued in the violent handling of the \u201cgrandmother,\u201d Nokomis, who, as a result of the cutting of the liana and the fall downwards, seems in some way to have become pregnant. The \u201ccutting of the branch,\u201d the plucking, we have already recognized as mother incest. (See above.) That well-known verse, \u201cSaxonland, where beautiful maidens grow upon trees,\u201d and phrases like \u201cpicking cherries in a neighbor\u2019s garden,\u201d allude to a similar idea. The fall downwards of Nokomis deserves to be compared to a poetical figure in Heine.\u201cA star, a star is falling            Out of the glittering sky!           The star of Love! I watch it            Sink in the depths and die.\u201cThe leaves and buds are falling            From many an apple-tree;           I watch the mirthful breezes            Embrace them wantonly...\u201dWenonah later was courted by the caressing West Wind, and becomes pregnant. Wenonah, as a young moon-goddess, has the beauty of the moonlight. Nokomis warns her of the dangerous courtship of Mudjekeewis, the West Wind. But Wenonah allows herself to become infatuated, and conceives from the breath of the wind, from the \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1, a son, our hero.\u201cAnd the West-Wind came at evening,\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7",

    "question": "What is the significance of Nokomis warning Wenonah about the dangerous courtship of Mudjekeewis?",
    "answer": "Nokomis warning Wenonah about the dangerous courtship of Mudjekeewis is significant because it highlights the potential dangers and consequences of such courtships.
