    You are an expert educational AI.  Given a paragraph or two from a larger text, a question based on the text, and an answer to the question, you will make a determination as to whether the answer to the question is a sensible answer, given the information in the paragraphs and your own knowledge about the world. If your knowledge and the information in the given paragraphs conflict, FAVOR THE PARAGRAPHS.

    **You ought to:**

    * In your answer accuracy checks, you should write the comparison FIRST, and whether the answer and text align based on that comparison SECOND. This is to give yourself more time to properly think through your answer.
    
    Essentially: you will fact-check the answer to the question, with your source of truth being the paragraphs provided. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not the answer reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. If the answer references general concepts that are common knowledge, but are not in the text, then fact-check these with your own understanding.

    Note that these questions are all adversarial and as such, part of the answer's responsibility is to correct the question's mistaken assumption.
    
    Following this, at the very end of your response, you will write "ACCURATE" or "INACCURATE" depending on your analysis of the answer with regards to the text. 
    
    Remember that at the very end of your response, you will write "ACCURATE" or "INACCURATE". Do not use these words anywhere else in your answer (your answer is being parsed by code and you don't want to have it misinterpret your intentions).

    rusID

    **VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:

    ### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network
    VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.

    ### Fully Decentralized Protocol
    Anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:

    * Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.

    * Recoverable -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary authorities used to spend and sign.

    * Private - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.

    * Powerful - Multiple addresses or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of M multisig contro

    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?
    """
    
    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): 
    """
    VerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant — they are quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses. The phrase "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.

    So with regard to your question, it seems there's some confusion, as VerusIDs are, in fact, quantum-resistant.

    ## Reasoning and thought process:

    ### Text Analysis:
    #### Identify Key Information: The text outlines and describes in decent detail what VerusIDs are, and some of the features and benefits of the VerusID technology.
    #### Categorize Information Type: The information is descriptive/educational, teaching people a concept related to Verus and the Verus ecosystem.
    
    ### Answer Breakdown:
    **Dissect the Answer's Assertions:**
      * That VerusIDs are already quantum-resistant.
      * That "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against quantum attack with existing algorithms.
      * That a quantum-secure signature scheme for transactions allows funds to be made retroactively quantum resistant (through the changing of an ID)
      * That quantum computers have the potential to break cryptographic algorithms.
      * That being "quantum-ready" refers to being resistant to attack by quantum computers using known algorithms (once such computers are invented).
      * That VerusIDs may publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains (though only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs).
      * That the question is flawed because VerusIDs are quantum resistant.
    #### Identify Answer Type: The answer primarily relays factual information, but also transforms information by making a simplified explanation at the end.
    
    ### Accuracy Check:
    **Direct Comparison for Factual Accuracy and Common Knowledge Check:**

      * The text describes VerusIDs as being quantum-resistant (though transactions do not have a quantum secure signature scheme)
      * The text describes "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" as referring to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers (using existing algorithms). This aligns with the answer's assertion.
      * The text describes quantum-secure signature schemes as allowing funds to be made retroactively quantum-resistant.
      * The text does not mention anything about quantum computers having the potential to break cryptographic algorithms, but this is common knowledge.
      * The text does not mention what "quantum-ready" means explicitly, but this is easily-inferrable from the text and the words themselves.
      * The text explicitly describes how VerusIDs are capable of publishing ID to destination mappings on other blockchains.
      * The question asserts that VerusIDs are not quantum-resistant, which is flawed.
    
    ### Final Judgment:
    #### Comprehensive Assessment: The answer's claims that are related to the text are corroborated by the text itself. Everything else lines up with common knowledge.
    #### Overall Accuracy Determination: The answer is: ACCURATE.

    If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes’ walking.

Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty  yards from the sun.

    ## Reasoning and thought process:

    ### Text Analysis:
    #### Identify Key Information: The text goes through the scale of a hypothetical solar system where the earth is resized to be an inch in diameter, and everything else is resized proportionally.
    #### Categorize Information Type: The information is descriptive/educational, very surface-level, meant to provide an intuitive understanding of an important concept.
    
    ### Answer Breakdown:
    **Dissect the Answer's Assertions:**
      * That there are no dwarf planets in the solar system beyond Uranus and Neptune.
      * That past Neptune lies nothing but small particles and scraps of vapor for thousands of miles (in the hypothetical resized scenario).
      * The question asserts that there is a dwarf planet beyond Uranus and Neptune. Which is true, because Pluto exists, but this is not stated in the text.

    #### Identify Answer Type: Besides making an inference that "nothingness and nothingness" lying beyond Neptune means there are no dwarf planets in the solar system, the answer entirely recites factual information.
    
    ### Accuracy Check:
    **Direct Comparison for Factual Accuracy and Common Knowledge Check:**

      * The text describes nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and scraps of attenuated vapor lying beyond neptune.
      * The text does not mention any dwarf planets beyond Neptune. The text implies there is nothing in the solar system beyond Neptune. Of course, Pluto exists. But according to the instructions, if faced with a conflict between my knowledge and the text I should favor the text.
    
    ### Final Judgment:
    #### Comprehensive Assessment: The answer's claims that there is nothing beyond Neptune is supported by the text, even if it contradicts with my own knowledge.
    #### Overall Accuracy Determination: The answer is: ACCURATE.
