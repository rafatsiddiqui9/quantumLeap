{"paragraph": "The root _l\u00e2_, with the meaning of \u201cto make sound, to bark,\u201d is found in Sanskrit _las_, _l\u00e1sati_ = to resound; and _las_, _l\u00e1sati_ = to radiate, to shine.The related root _les\u00f4_, with the meaning \u201cdesire,\u201d is also found in Sanskrit _las_, _l\u00e1sati_ = to play; _lash_, _l\u00e1shati_ = to desire. Greek \u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 = lustful, Gothic _lustus_, New High German _Lust_, Latin _lascivus_.A further related root, _l\u00e1s\u00f4_ = to shine, to radiate, is found in _las_, _l\u00e1sati_ = to radiate, to shine.This group unites, as is evident, the meanings of \u201cto desire, to play, to radiate, and to sound.\u201d A similar archaic confluence of meanings in the primal libido symbolism (as we are perhaps justified in calling it) is found in that class of Egyptian words which are derived from the closely related roots _ben_ and _bel_ and the reduplication _benben_ and _belbel_. The original significance of these roots is \u201cto burst forth, to emerge, to extrude, to well out,\u201d with the associated idea of bubbling, boiling and roundness. _Belbel_, accompanied by the sign of the obelisk, of originally phallic nature, means source of light. The obelisk itself had besides the names of _techenu_ and _men_ also the name _benben_, more rarely _berber_ and _belbel_.[324] The libido symbolism makes clear this connection, it seems to me.The Indo-Germanic root _vel_, with the meaning \u201cto wave, to undulate\u201d (fire), is found in Sanskrit _ulunka_ = burning, Greek \u1f00\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1, Attic \u1f01\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1 = warmth of the sun, Gothic _vulan_ = to undulate, Old High German and Middle High German _walm_ = heat, glow.The related Indo-Germanic root _v\u00e9lk\u00f4_, with the meaning of \u201cto lighten, to glow,\u201d is found in Sanskrit _ulk\u0103_ = firebrand, Greek \u03dc\u03b5\u03bb\u03c7\u1fb6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 = Vulcan. This same root _vel_ means also \u201cto sound\u201d; in Sanskrit _v\u00e2n\u00ed_ = tone, song, music. Tschech _volati_ = to call.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
