{"paragraph": "\u201cIn our sleep and in our dreams we pass through the whole thought of  earlier humanity. I mean, in the same way that man reasons in his  dreams, he reasoned when in the waking state many thousands of years.  The first _causa_ which occurred to his mind in reference to anything  that needed explanation, satisfied him and passed for truth. In the  dream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within  us, for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty  developed, and which is still developing in every individual. The  dream carries us back into earlier states of human culture, and  affords us a means of understanding it better. The dream thought is so  easy to us now, because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the  interminable stages of evolution during which this phantastic and  facile form of theorizing has prevailed. To a certain extent the dream  is a restorative for the brain, which during the day is called upon to  meet the severe demands for trained thought, made by the conditions of  a higher civilization.\u201cFrom these facts, we can understand how lately more acute logical  thinking, the taking seriously of cause and effect, has been  developed; when our functions of reason and intelligence still reach  back involuntarily to those primitive forms of conclusion, and we live  about half our lives in this condition.\u201dWe have already seen that Freud, independently of Nietzsche, has reached a similar standpoint from the basis of dream analysis. The step from this established proposition to the perception of the myths as familiar dream images is no longer a great one. Freud has formulated this conclusion himself.[36]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
