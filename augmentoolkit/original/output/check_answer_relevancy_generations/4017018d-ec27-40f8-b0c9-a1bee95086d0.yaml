    are told in this passage _he is Dhulqarnein, Alexander, the Sun; he goes to the
    place of setting and he goes to the place of rising_. The passage about the unknown
    servant of God is explained by the commentaries in a well-defined legend. The
    servant is Chidher, “the verdant one,” the never-tiring wanderer, who roams for
    hundreds and thousands of years over lands and seas, the teacher and counsellor
    of pious men; the one wise in divine knowledge—the immortal.[371] The authority
    of the Tabari associates Chidher with Dhulqarnein; Chidher is said to have reached
    the “stream of life” as a follower of Alexander, and both unwittingly had drunk
    of it, so that they became immortal. Moreover, _Chidher is identified by the old
    commentators with Elias_, who also did not die, but _who was taken to Heaven in
    a fiery chariot_. Elias is _Helios_.[372] It is to be observed that Ahasver also
    owes his existence to an obscure place in the holy Christian scriptures. This
    place is to be found in Matthew xvi:28. First comes the scene where Christ appoints
    Peter as the rock of his church, and nominates him the governor of his power.[373]
    After that follows the prophecy of his death, and then comes the passage:“Verily,
    I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not  taste of death till
    they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”Here follows the scene of the transfiguration:“And
    was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,  and his raiment
    was white as the light.“And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
    with him.“Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to  be
    here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for  thee and one
    for Moses and one for Elias.’”[374]"""
