    "paragraph": "All these sea-going gods are sun symbols. They are enclosed in a chest or an ark for the \u201cnight journey on the sea\u201d (Frobenius), often together with a woman (again an inversion of the actual situation, but in support of the motive of continuous cohabitation, which we have met above). During the night journey on the sea the Sun-god is enclosed in the mother\u2019s womb, oftentimes threatened by dangers of all kinds. Instead of many individual examples, I will content myself with reproducing the scheme which Frobenius has constructed from numberless myths of this sort:[Illustration: _To devour_ _West_ _East_ _W-E movement\u2014(sea journey)_ _Heat-hair_ _To slip out_ _To open_ _To land_ _Sea journey_ _To set on fire or To cut off the heart_]Frobenius gives the following legend to illustrate this:\u201cA hero is devoured by a water monster in the West (to devour). The  animal carries him within him to the East (sea journey). Meanwhile, he  kindles a fire in the belly of the monster (to set on fire) and since  he feels hungry he cuts off a piece of the hanging heart (to cut off  the heart). Soon after he notices that the fish glides upon the dry  land (to land); he immediately begins to cut open the animal from  within outwards (to open) then he slides out (to slip out). In the  fish\u2019s belly, it had been so hot, that all his hair had fallen out  (heat-hair). The hero frequently frees all who were previously  devoured (to devour all) and all now slide out (slip out).\u201d",
