    "question": "How does the text explain the difference between ancient and modern cultural development?",
    "answer": "The text explains that ancient cultural development was limited because the ancients did not have the training in directed thinking. They failed to sublimate libido from other natural relations voluntarily and did not engage in anthropomorphism. In contrast, modern cultural development is attributed to the mobility of libido and its capacity for transference, which enables more advanced and directed thinking.",
