{"paragraph": "The benevolent bird, a wish thought of deliverance which arises from introversion,[693] advises the hero to shoot the magician under the hair, which is the only vulnerable spot. This spot is the \u201cphallic\u201d point,[694] if one may venture to say so; it is at _the top of the head_, at the _place where the mystic birth from the head takes place_, which even to-day appears in children\u2019s sexual theories. Into that Hiawatha shoots (one may say, very naturally) three arrows[695] (the well-known phallic symbol), and thus kills Megissogwon. Thereupon he steals the magic wampum armor, which renders him invulnerable (means of immortality). He significantly leaves the dead lying in the water\u2014because the magician is the fearful mother:\u201cOn the shore he left the body,          Half on land and half in water,          In the sand his feet were buried,          And his face was in the water.\u201dThus the situation is the same as with the fish king, because the monster is the personification of the water of death, which in its turn represents the devouring mother. This great deed of Hiawatha\u2019s, where he has vanquished the mother as the death-bringing demon,[696] is followed by his marriage with Minnehaha.A little fable which the poet has inserted in the later song is noteworthy. An old man is transformed into a youth, by _crawling through a hollow oak tree_.In the fourteenth song is a description of how Hiawatha discovers writing. I limit myself to the description of two hieroglyphic tokens:\u201cGitche Manito the Mighty,          He, the Master of Life, was painted          As an egg, with points projecting          To the four winds of the heavens.          Everywhere is the Great Spirit,          Was the meaning of this symbol.\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
