    "paragraph": "The Pramantha, as the tool of Manthana (the fire sacrifice), is considered purely sexual in the Hindoo; the Pramantha as phallus, or man; the bored wood underneath as vulva, or woman.[292] The resulting fire is the child, the divine son Agni. The two pieces of wood are called in the cult Pur\u00fbravas and Urva\u00e7\u00ee, and were thought of personified as man and woman. The fire was born from the genitals of the woman.[293] An especially interesting representation of fire production, as a religious ceremony (manthana), is given by Weber:[294]\u201cA certain sacrificial fire was lit by the rubbing together of two  sticks; one piece of wood is taken up with the words: \u2018Thou art the  birthplace of the fire,\u2019 and two blades of grass are placed upon it;  \u2018Ye are the two testicles,\u2019 to the \u2018adh\u00e2rarani\u2019 (the underlying wood):  \u2018Thou art Urva\u00e7\u00ee\u2019; then the utar\u00e2rani (that which is placed on top) is  anointed with butter. \u2018Thou art Power.\u2019 This is then placed on the  adh\u00e2rarani. \u2018Thou art Pur\u00fbravas\u2019 and both are rubbed three times. \u2018I  rub thee with the G\u00e2yatr\u00eemetrum: I rub thee with the Trishtubhme\u1e6drum:  I rub thee with the Jagat\u00eemetrum.\u2019\u201dThe sexual symbolism of this fire production is unmistakable. We see here also the rhythm, the metre in its original place as sexual rhythm, rising above the mating call into music. A song of the Rigveda[295] conveys the same interpretation and symbolism:\u201cHere is the gear for function, here tinder made ready for the spark. Bring thou the matron:[296] we will rub Agni in ancient fashion forth. In the two fire-sticks J\u00e2tavedas lieth, even as the well-formed germ in   pregnant women; Agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with   oblations; Lay this with care on that which lies extended: straight hath she borne   the steer when made prolific.",

    "question": "What does the Rigveda song contribute to our understanding of the sexual symbolism in the Pramantha ritual?",
    "answer": "The Rigveda song reinforces the sexual symbolism by referring to the fire sticks as the \"gear for function\" and \"tinder made ready for the spark,\" and inviting a \"matron\" to rub Agni. It also uses metaphorical language to describe the fire sticks as lying in the woman, symbolizing the union of man and woman, and notes that \"Agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with oblations.\" This song underscores the sexual and creative elements central to the ritual.",
