    "paragraph": "The analytic interpretation of Cassius\u2019s irritability plainly reveals that at these moments he identifies himself with the mother, and his conduct, therefore, is truly feminine, as his speech demonstrates most excellently. For his womanish love-seeking and desperate subjection under the proud masculine will of Brutus calls forth the friendly remark of the latter, that Cassius is yoked with a lamb, that is to say, has something very weak in his character, which is derived from the mother. One recognizes in this without any difficulty the analytic hall-marks of an infantile disposition, which, as always, is characterized by a prevalence of the parent-imago, here the mother-imago. An infantile individual is infantile because he has freed himself insufficiently, or not at all, from the childish environment, that is, from his adaptation to his parents. Therefore, on one side, he reacts falsely towards the world, as a child towards his parents, always demanding love and immediate reward for his feelings; on the other side, on account of the close connection to the parents, he identifies himself with them. The infantile individual behaves like the father and mother. He is not in a condition to live for himself and to find the place to which he belongs. Therefore, Brutus very justly takes it for granted that the \u201cmother chides\u201d in Cassius, not he himself. The psychologically valuable fact which we gather here is the information _that Cassius is infantile and identified_ with the mother. The hysterical behavior is due to the circumstance that Cassius is still, in part, a lamb, and _an innocent and entirely harmless child_. He remains, as far as his emotional life is concerned, still far behind himself. This we often see among people who, as masters, apparently govern life and fellow-creatures; they have remained children in regard to the demands of their love nature.",

    "question": "How does Cassius's behavior reflect an infantile disposition according to the provided text?",
    "answer": "Cassius's behavior reflects an infantile disposition because he identifies with the mother and exhibits a prevalence of the mother-imago. He is described as having a weak character, being yoked with a lamb, and reacting to the world in a childlike manner, always demanding love and immediate rewards for his feelings. This behavior is seen as being characterized by a failure to sufficiently or completely free himself from his childhood environment and his adaptation to his parents.",
