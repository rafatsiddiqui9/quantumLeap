Cradle and grave,       An eternal sea;       A changing web,       A glowing life.\u201d     \u2014_Goethe: Faust._\u201cIt grows, it shines, increases in my hand!\u201dThat is primitive libido symbolism, which shows how immediate is the connection between phallic libido and light. The same relations are found in the Rigveda in Rudra\u2019s utterances._Rigveda_ 1, 114, 3:\u201cMay we obtain your favor, thou man ruling, Oh urinating Rudra.\u201dI refer here to the previously mentioned phallic symbolism of Rudra in the Upanishads:(4) \u201cWe call for help below to the flaming Rudra, to the one bringing  the sacrifice; him who encircles and wanders (wandering in the vault  of Heaven) to the seer.\u201d2, 33, 5:\u201cHe who opens up the sweet, who listens to our calls, the ruddy one,  with the beautiful helmet, may he not give us over to the powers of  jealousy.(6) \u201cI have been rejoiced by the bull connected with Marut, the  supplicating one with strong force of life.(8) \u201cSound the powerful song of praise to the ruddy bull to the white  shining one; worship the flaming one with honor, we sing of the  shining being Rudra.\u201cMay Rudra\u2019s missile (arrow) not be used on us, may the great  displeasure of the shining one pass us by: Unbend the firm (bow or  hard arrow?) for the princes, thou who blessest with the waters of thy  body (generative strength), be gracious to our children and  grandchildren.\u201d[449]",
