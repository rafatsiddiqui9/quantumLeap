    "paragraph": "This case throws a light upon the mechanism of the phantasies in general. The known, conscious phantasy may be of mythical or other material; it is not to be taken seriously as such, for it has an indirect meaning. If we take it, however, as important per se, then the thing is not understandable, and makes one despair of the efficiency of the mind. But we saw, in the case of Abb\u00e9 Oegger, that his doubts and his hopes did not turn upon the historical problem of Judas, but upon his own personality, which wished to win a way to freedom for itself through the solution of the Judas problem.",

    "question": "How should one understand a phantasy if it is taken as important in itself?",
    "answer": "If a phantasy is taken as important in itself, it becomes difficult to understand and can lead to a sense of despair regarding the mind's ability to work effectively. It is important to view a phantasy as having a deeper, indirect meaning rather than as a literal, self-contained entity.",
