Hecate has snakelike feet, which, as in the triple\nform ascribed to Hecate, points to her phallic libido nature.[721] In\nTralles, Hecate appears next to Priapus; there is also a Hecate\nAphrodisias. Her symbols are the key,[722] the whip,[723] the\nsnake,[724] the dagger[725] and the torch.[726] As mother of death, dogs\naccompany her, the significance of which we have previously discussed at\nlength. As guardian of the door of Hades and as Goddess of dogs, she is\nof threefold form, and really identified with Cerberus. Thus Hercules,\nin bringing up Cerberus, brings the conquered mother of death into the\nupper world. As spirit mother (moon!), she sends madness, lunacy. (This\nmythical observation states that “the mother” sends madness; by far the\nmajority of the cases of insanity consist, in fact, in the domination of\nthe individual by the material of the incest phantasy.) In the mysteries\nof Cerberus, a rod, called λευκόφυλλος,[727] was broken off. This rod\nprotected the purity of virgins, and caused any one who touched the\nplant to become insane. We recognize in this the motive of the sacred\ntree, which, as mother, must not be touched, an act which only an insane\nperson would commit. Hecate, as nightmare, appears in the form of\nEmpusa, in a vampire rôle, or as Lamia, as devourer of men; perhaps,\nalso, in that more beautiful guise, “The Bride of Corinth.” She is the\nmother of all charms and witches, the patron of Medea, because the power\nof the “terrible mother” is magical and irresistible (working upward\nfrom the unconscious). In Greek syncretism, she plays a very significant\nrôle. She is confused with Artemis, who also has the surname ἑκάτη,[728]\n“the one striking at a distance” or “striking according to her will,” in\nwhich we recognize again her superior power. Artemis is the huntress,\nwith hounds, and so Hecate, through confusion with her, becomes\nκυνηγετική, the wild nocturnal huntress. (God, as huntsman, see above.)\nShe has her name in common with Apollo, ἕκατος ἑκάεργος.[729] From the\nstandpoint of the libido theory, this connection is easily\nunderstandable, because Apollo merely symbolizes the more positive side\nof the same amount of libido. The confusion of Hecate with Brimo as\nsubterranean mother is understandable; also with Persephone and Rhea,\nthe primitive all-mother. Intelligible through the maternal significance\nis the confusion with Ilithyia, the midwife. Hecate is also the direct\ngoddess of births, κουροτρόφος,[730] the multiplier of cattle, and\ngoddess of marriage. Hecate, orphically, occupies the centre of the\nworld as Aphrodite and Gaia, even as the world soul in general. On a\ncarved gem[731] she is represented carrying the cross on her head. The\nbeam on which the criminal was scourged is called ἑκάτη.[732] To her, as\nto the Roman Trivia, the triple roads, or _Scheideweg_, “forked road,”\nor crossways were dedicated. And where roads branch off or unite\nsacrifices of dogs were brought her; there the bodies of the executed\nwere thrown; the sacrifice occurs at the _point of crossing_.\nEtymologically, _scheide_, “sheath”; for example, sword-sheath, sheath\nfor water-shed and sheath for vagina, is identical with _scheiden_, “to\nsplit,” or “to separate.” The meaning of a sacrifice at this place\nwould, therefore, be as follows: to offer something to the mother at the\nplace of junction or at the fissure. (Compare the sacrifice to the\nchthonic gods in the abyss.) The Temenos of Ge, the abyss and the well,\nare easily understood as the gates of life and death,[733] “past which\nevery one gladly creeps” (Faust), and sacrifices there his obolus or his\nπελανοί,[734] instead of his body, just as Hercules soothes Cerberus\nwith the honey cakes. (Compare with this the mythical significance of\nthe dog!) Thus the crevice at Delphi, with the spring, Castalia, was the\nseat of the chthonic dragon, Python, who was conquered by the sun-hero,\nApollo. (Python, incited by Hera, pursued Leta, pregnant with Apollo;\nbut she, on the floating island of Delos [nocturnal journey on the sea],\ngave birth to her child, who later slew the Python; that is to say,\nconquered in it the spirit mother.) In Hierapolis (Edessa) the temple\nwas erected above the crevice through which the flood had poured out,\nand in Jerusalem the foundation stone of the temple covered the great\nabyss,[735] just as Christian churches are frequently built over caves,\ngrottoes, wells, etc. In the Mithra grotto,[736] and all the other\nsacred caves up to the Christian catacombs, which owe their significance\nnot to the legendary persecutions but to the worship of the dead,[737]\nwe come across the same fundamental motive. The burial of the dead in a\nholy place (in the “garden of the dead,” in cloisters, crypts, etc.) is\nrestitution to the mother, with the certain hope of resurrection by\nwhich such burial is rightfully rewarded. The animal of death which\ndwells in the cave had to be soothed in early times through human\nsacrifices; later with natural gifts.[738] Therefore, the Attic custom\ngives to the dead the μελιτοῦττα, to pacify the dog of hell, the\nthree-headed monster at the gate of the underworld. A more recent\nelaboration of the natural gifts seems to be the obolus for Charon, who\nis, therefore, designated by Rohde as the second Cerberus, corresponding\nto the Egyptian dog-faced god Anubis.[739] Dog and serpent of the\nunderworld (Dragon) are likewise identical. In the tragedies, the\nErinnyes are serpents as well as dogs; the serpents Tychon and Echnida\nare parents of the serpents—Hydra, the dragon of the Hesperides, and\nGorgo; and of the dogs, Cerberus, Orthrus, Scylla.[740] Serpents and\ndogs are also protectors of the treasure. The chthonic god was probably\nalways a serpent dwelling in a cave, and was fed with πελανοί.[741] In\nthe Asclepiadean of the later period, the sacred serpents were scarcely\nvisible, meaning that they probably existed only figuratively.[742]\nNothing was left but the hole in which the snake was said to dwell.\nThere the πελανοί[743] were placed; later the obolus was thrown in. The\nsacred cavern in the temple of Kos consisted of a rectangular pit, upon\nwhich was laid a stone lid, with a square hole; this arrangement serves\nthe purpose of a treasure house. The snake hole had become a slit for\nmoney, a “sacrificial box,” and the cave had become a “treasure.” That\nthis development, which Herzog traces, agrees excellently with the\nactual condition is shown by a discovery in the temple of Asclepius and\nHygieia in Ptolemais:\n\n  “An encoiled granite snake, with arched neck, was found. In the middle\n  of the coil is seen a narrow slit, polished by usage, just large\n  enough to allow a coin of four centimeters diameter at most to fall\n  through. At the side are holes for handles to lift the heavy pieces,\n  the under half of which is used as a cover.”—_Herzog_, _Ibid._, p.\n  212.\n\nThe serpent, as protector of the hoard, now lies on the treasure house.\nThe fear of the maternal womb of death has become the guardian of the\ntreasure of life. That the snake in this connection is really a symbol\nof death, that is to say, of the dead libido, results from the fact that\nthe souls of the dead, like the chthonic gods, appear as _serpents_, as\ndwellers in the kingdom of the mother of death.[744] This development of\nsymbol allows us to recognize easily the transition of the originally\nvery primitive significance of the crevice in the earth as mother to the\nmeaning of treasure house, and can, therefore, support the etymology of\n_Hort_, “hoard, treasure,” as suggested by Kluge, κεύθω, belonging to\nκὲῦθος, means the innermost womb of the earth (Hades); κύσθος, that\nKluge adds, is of similar meaning, cavity or womb. Prellwitz does not\nmention this connection. Fick,[745] however, compares New High German\n_hort_, Gothic _huzd_, to Armenian _kust_, “abdomen”; Church Slavonian\n_čista_, Vedic _kostha_ = abdomen, from the Indo-Germanic root\n_koustho -s_ = viscera, lower abdomen, room, store-room. Prellwitz\ncompares κύσθος κύστις = urinary bladder, bag, purse; Sanskrit\n_kustha-s_ = cavity of the loins; then κύτος = cavity, vault; κύτις =\nlittle chest, from κυέω = I am pregnant. Here, from κύτος = cave, κύυαρ\n= hole, κύαθος = cup, κύλα - depression under the eye, κῦμα = swelling,\nwave, billow, κῦρος = power, force, κύριος = lord, Old Iranian _caur_,\n_cur_ = hero; Sanskrit _çura -s_ = strong, hero. The fundamental\nIndo-Germanic roots[746] are _kevo_ = to swell, to be strong. From that\nthe above-mentioned κυέω, κύαρ, κῦρος and Latin _cavus_ = hollow,\nvaulted, cavity, hole; _cavea_ = cavity, enclosure, cage, scene and\nassembly; _caulæ_ = cavity, opening, enclosure, stall[747]; _kuéyô_ =\nswell; participle, _kueyonts_ = swelling; _en-kueyonts_ = pregnant,\nἐγηυέων = Latin _inciens_ = pregnant; compare Sanskrit _vi-çvá-yan_ =\nswelling; _kûro -s_ (_kevaro -s_), strong, powerful hero.\n\nThe treasure which the hero fetches from the dark cavern is swelling\nlife; it is himself, the hero, new-born from the anxiety of pregnancy\nand the birth throes. Thus the Hindoo fire-bringer is called Mâtariçvan,\nmeaning the one swelling in the mother. The _hero striving towards the\nmother is the dragon, and when he separates from the mother he becomes\nthe conqueror of the dragon_.[748] This train of thought, which we have\nalready hinted at previously in Christ and Antichrist, may be traced\neven into the details of Christian phantasy. There is a series of\nmediæval pictures[749] in which the communion cup contains a dragon, a\nsnake or some sort of small animal.[750]\n\nThe cup is the receptacle, the maternal womb, of the god resurrected in\nthe wine; the cup is the cavern where the serpent dwells, the god who\nsheds his skin, in the state of metamorphosis; for Christ is also the\nserpent. These symbolisms are used in an obscure connection in I\nCorinthians, verse 10: Paul writes of the Jews who “were all baptized\nunto Moses in the cloud and in the sea” (also reborn) and “did all drink\nthe same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual rock that\nfollowed them, and that rock was Christ.” They drank from the mother\n(the generative rock, birth from the rock) the milk of rejuvenation, the\nmead of immortality, and this Rock was Christ, here identified with the\nmother, because he is the symbolic representative of the mother libido.\nWhen we drink from the cup, then we drink from the mother’s breast\nimmortality and everlasting salvation. Paul wrote of the Jews that they\nate and then rose up to dance and to indulge in fornication, and then\ntwenty-three thousand of them were swept off by the plague of serpents.\nThe remedy for the survivors, however, was the sight of a serpent\nhanging on a pole. From it was derived the cure.",
