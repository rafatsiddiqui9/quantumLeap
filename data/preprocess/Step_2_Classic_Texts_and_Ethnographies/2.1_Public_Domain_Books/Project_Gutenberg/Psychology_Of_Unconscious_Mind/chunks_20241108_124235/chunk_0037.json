They represent brothers who reveal their character through the\nsymbolic position of the torch. Cumont connects them, not without\nmeaning, with the sepulchral “erotes” who as genii with the reversed\ntorches have traditional meaning. The one is supposed to stand for death\nand the other for life. I cannot refrain from mentioning the similarity\nbetween the Sacrificium Mithriacum (where the sacrificed bull in the\ncentre is flanked on both sides by Dadophores) to the Christian\nsacrifice of the lamb (ram). The Crucified is also traditionally flanked\nby the two thieves, one of whom ascends to Paradise, while the other\ndescends to Hell.[396] The idea of the mortal and the immortal seems to\nhave passed also into the Christian worship. Semitic gods are often\nrepresented as flanked by two Paredroi; for example, Baal of Edessa,\naccompanied by Aziz and Monimoz (Baal as the Sun, accompanied by Mars\nand Mercury, as expressed in astronomical teachings). According to the\nChaldean view, the gods are grouped into triads. In this circle of ideas\nbelongs also the Trinity, the idea of the triune God, in which Christ\nmust be considered in his unity with the Father and the Holy Ghost. So,\ntoo, do the two thieves belong inwardly to Christ. The two Dadophores\nare, as Cumont points out, nothing but offshoots[397] from the chief\nfigure of Mithra, to whom belongs a mysterious threefold character.\nAccording to an account of Dionysus Areopagita, the magicians celebrated\na festival, “τοῦ τριπλασίου Μίθρου.”[398][399] An observation likewise\nreferring to the Trinity is made by Plutarch concerning Ormuzd: τρὶς\nἑαυτὸν αὐξήσας ἀπέστησε τοῦ ἡλίου.[400] The Trinity, as three different\nstates of the unity, is also a Christian thought. In the very first\nplace this suggests a sun myth. An observation by Macrobius 1:18 seems\nto lend support to this idea:\n\n  “Hæ autem ætatum diversitates ad solem referuntur, ut parvulus\n  videatur hiemali solstitio, qualem Aegyptii proferunt ex adyto die\n  certa, ... æquinoctio vernali figura iuvenis ornatur. Postea statuitur\n  ætas ejus plenissima effigie barbæ solstitio æstivo ... exunde per\n  diminutiones veluti senescenti quarta forma deus figuratur.”[401][402]\n\nAs Cumont observes, Cautes and Cautapates occasionally carry in their\nhands the head of a bull, and a scorpion.[403] Taurus and Scorpio are\nequinoctial signs, which clearly indicate that the sacrificial scene\nrefers primarily to the Sun cycle; the rising Sun, which sacrifices\nitself at the summer solstice, and the setting Sun. In the sacrificial\nscene the symbol of the rising and setting Sun was not easily\nrepresented; therefore, this idea was removed from the sacrificial\nimage.\n\nWe have pointed out above that the Dioscuri represent a similar idea,\nalthough in a somewhat different form; the one sun is always mortal, the\nother immortal. As this entire sun mythology is merely a psychologic\nprojection to the heavens, the fundamental thesis probably is as\nfollows; just as man consists of a mortal and immortal part, so the sun\nis a pair of brothers,[404] one being mortal, the other immortal. This\nthought lies at the basis of all theology in general. Man is, indeed,\nmortal, but there are some who are immortal, or there is something in us\nwhich is immortal. Thus the gods, “a Chidher or a St. Germain,” are our\nimmortal part, which, though incomprehensible, dwells among us\nsomewhere.\n\nComparison with the sun teaches us over and over again that the gods are\nlibido. It is that part of us which is immortal, since it represents\nthat bond through which we feel that in the race we are never\nextinguished.[405] It is life from the life of mankind. Its springs,\nwhich well up from the depths of the unconscious, come, as does our life\nin general, from the root of the whole of humanity, since we are indeed\nonly a twig broken off from the mother and transplanted.\n\nSince the divine in us is the libido,[406] we must not wonder that we\nhave taken along with us in our theology ancient representations from\nolden times, which give the triune figure to the God. We have taken this\nτριπλάσιον Θεόν[407] from the phallic symbolism, the originality of\nwhich may well be uncontested.[408] The male genitals are the basis for\nthis Trinity. It is an anatomical fact that one testicle is generally\nplaced somewhat higher than the other, and it is also a very old, but,\nnevertheless, still surviving, superstition that one testicle generates\na boy and the other a girl.[409] A late Babylonian bas-relief from\nLajard’s[410] collection seems to be in accordance with this view. In\nthe middle of the image stands an androgynous god (masculine and\nfeminine face[411]); upon the right, male side, is found a serpent, with\na sun halo round its head; upon the left, female side, there is also a\nserpent, with the moon above its head. Above the head of the god there\nare three stars. This ensemble would seem to confirm the Trinity[412] of\nthe representation. The Sun serpent at the right side is male; the\nserpent at the left side is female (signified by the moon). This image\npossesses a symbolic sexual suffix, which makes the sexual significance\nof the whole obtrusive. Upon the male side a rhomb is found—a favorite\nsymbol of the female genitals; upon the female side there is a wheel or\nfelly. A wheel always refers to the Sun, but the spokes are thickened\nand enlarged at the ends, which suggests phallic symbolism. It seems to\nbe a phallic wheel, which was not unknown in antiquity. There are\nobscene bas-reliefs where Cupid turns a wheel of nothing but\nphalli.[413] It is not only the serpent which suggests the phallic\nsignificance of the Sun; I quote one especially marked case, from an\nabundance of proof. In the antique collection at Verona I discovered a\nlate Roman mystic inscription in which are the following\nrepresentations:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThese symbols are easily read: Sun—Phallus, Moon—Vagina (Uterus). This\ninterpretation is confirmed by another figure of the same collection.\nThere the same representation is found, only the vessel[414] is replaced\nby the figure of a woman. The impressions on coins, where in the middle\na palm is seen encoiled by a snake, flanked by two stones (testicles),\nor else in the middle a stone encircled by a snake; to the right a palm,\nto the left a shell (female genitals[415]), should be interpreted in a\nsimilar manner. In Lajard’s “Researches” (“The Cult of Venus”) there is\na coin of Perga, where Artemis of Perga is represented by a conical\nstone (phallic) flanked by a man (claimed to be Men) and by a female\nfigure (claimed to be Artemis). Men (the so-called Lunus) is found upon\nan Attic bas-relief apparently with the spear but fundamentally a\nsceptre with a phallic significance, flanked by Pan with a club\n(phallus) and a female figure.[416] The traditional representation of\nthe Crucified flanked by John and Mary is closely associated with this\ncircle of ideas, precisely as is the Crucified with the thieves. From\nthis we see how, beside the Sun, there emerges again and again the much\nmore primitive comparison of the libido with the phallus. An especial\ntrace still deserves mention here. The Dadophor Cautapates, who\nrepresents Mithra, is also represented with the cock[417] and the\npineapple. But these are the attributes of the Phrygian god Men, whose\ncult was widely diffused. Men was represented with Pileus,[418] the\npineapple and the cock, also in the form of a boy, just as the\nDadophores are boyish figures. (This last-named property relates them\nwith Men to the Cabiri.) Men has a very close connection with Attis, the\nson and lover of Cybele. In the time of the Roman Cæsars, Men and Attis\nwere entirely identified, as stated above. Attis also wears the Pileus\nlike Men, Mithra and the Dadophores. As the son and lover of his mother\nhe again leads us to the source of this religion-creating incest libido,\nnamely, to the mother. Incest leads logically to ceremonial castration\nin the Attic-Cybele cult, for the Hero, driven insane by his mother,\nmutilates himself.[419] I must at present forego entering more deeply\ninto this matter, because the incest problem is to be discussed at the\nclose. Let this suggestion suffice—that from different directions the\nanalysis of the libido symbolism always leads back again to the mother\nincest. Therefore, we may surmise that the longing of the libido raised\nto God (repressed into the unconscious) is a primitive, incestuous one\nwhich concerns the mother. Through renouncing the virility to the first\nbeloved, the mother, the feminine element becomes extremely predominant;\nhence the strongly androgynous character of the dying and resurrected\nRedeemer. That these heroes are nearly always wanderers[420] is a\npsychologically clear symbolism. The wandering is a representation of\nlonging,[421] of the ever-restless desire, which nowhere finds its\nobject, for, unknown to itself, it seeks the lost mother. The wandering\nassociation renders the Sun comparison easily intelligible; also, under\nthis aspect, the heroes always resemble the wandering Sun, which seems\nto justify the fact that the myth of the hero is a sun myth. But the\nmyth of the hero, however, is, as it appears to me, the myth of our own\nsuffering unconscious, which has an unquenchable longing for all the\ndeepest sources of our own being; for the body of the mother, and\nthrough it for communion with infinite life in the countless forms of\nexistence. Here I must introduce the words of the Master who has divined\nthe deepest roots of Faustian longings:\n\n      “Unwilling, I reveal a loftier mystery.—\n      In solitude are throned the Goddesses,\n      No Space around them, Place and Time still less:\n      Only to speak of them embarrasses.\n      They are THE MOTHERS!\n\n      “Goddesses unknown to ye,\n      The Mortals,—named by us unwillingly.\n      Delve in the deepest depths must thou to reach them:\n      ’Tis thine own fault that we for help beseech them.\n\n      “Where is the way?\n\n                  “No way! To the Unreachable,\n      Ne’er to be trodden! A way to the Unbeseechable,\n      Never to be besought! Art thou prepared?\n      There are no locks, no latches to be lifted!\n      Through endless solitudes shalt thou be drifted!\n      Hast thou through solitudes and deserts dared?\n      And hadst thou swum to farthest verge of ocean\n      And there the boundless space beheld,\n      Still hadst thou seen wave after wave in motion,\n      Even though impending doom thy fear compelled.\n      Thou hadst seen something—in the beryl dim\n      Of peace-lulled seas, the sportive dolphins swim;\n      Hadst seen the flying clouds, sun, moon and star;\n      Nought shalt thou see in endless Void afar—\n      Not hear thy footstep fall, nor meet\n      A stable spot to rest thy feet.\n\n                “Here, take this key!\n      The Key will scent the true place from all others;\n      Follow it down! ‘Twill lead thee to the Mothers.\n\n      “Descend then! I could also say: Ascend!\n      ’Twere all the same. _Escape from the Created_\n      To shapeless forms in liberated spaces!\n      Enjoy what long ere this was dissipated!\n      There whirls the press, like clouds on clouds unfolding;\n      Then with stretched arm swing high the key thou’rt holding!\n\n      “At last a blazing tripod,[422] tells thee this,\n      That there the utterly deepest bottom is.\n      Its light to thee will then the Mothers show,\n      Some in their seats, the others stand or go,\n      At their own will: Formation, Transformation,\n      The Eternal Mind’s eternal recreation,\n      Forms of all Creatures,—there are floating free.\n      They’ll see thee not! for only wraiths they see.\n      So pluck up heart,—the danger then is great.\n      Go to the tripod ere thou hesitate,\n      And touch it with the key.”\n\n",
