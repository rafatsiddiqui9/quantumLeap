    "paragraph": "It frequently happens that the young person is so closely bound in the family relations that it is only with the greatest difficulty that he can attain any measure of freedom and then only very imperfectly, so that the libido sexualis can only express itself in certain feelings and phantasies which clearly reveal the existence of the complex until then entirely hidden and unrealized. Now commences the secondary struggle against the unfilial and immoral feelings with a consequent development of intense resistances expressing themselves in irritation, anger, revolt and antagonism against the parents, or else in an especially tender, submissive and yielding attitude which over-compensates for the rebellion and reaction held within.This struggle and conflict gives rise to the unconscious phantasy of self-sacrifice which really means the sacrificing of the childish tendencies and love type in order to free libido; for his nature demands that he attain the capacity for the accomplishment of his own personal fulfilment, the satisfaction of which belongs to the developed man and woman.This conception has been worked out in detail by Jung in the book which is herein presented to English readers.We now come to the most important of Jung\u2019s conceptions in that it bears practically upon the treatment of certain types of the neuroses and stands theoretically in direct opposition to Freud\u2019s hypothesis. While recognizing fully the influence of the parents and of the sexual constitution of the child, Jung refuses to see in this infantile past the real cause for the later development of the illness. He definitely places the cause of the pathogenic conflict _in the present moment_ and considers that in seeking for the cause in the distant past one is only following the desire of the patient, which is to withdraw himself as much as possible from the present important period.",

    "question": "How does Jung's conception of neuroses differ from Freud's?",
    "answer": "Jung's conception of neuroses differs from Freud's in that while both recognize the influence of parents and the child's sexual constitution on the development of illness, Jung places the cause of the pathogenic conflict in the present moment. In contrast, Freud's hypothesis suggests that the real cause of the illness lies in the infantile past. Jung argues that seeking the cause in the distant past is often a desire by the patient to avoid addressing the present important period.",
