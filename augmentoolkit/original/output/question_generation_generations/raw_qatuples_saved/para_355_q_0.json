    "paragraph": "This very typical wound, which also destroyed R\u00ea, is described in the following manner in an Egyptian hymn:\u201cThe ancient of the Gods moved his mouth,      He cast his saliva upon the earth,      And what he spat, fell upon the ground.      With her hands Isis kneaded that and the soil      Which was about it, together:      From that she created a venerable worm,      And made him like a spear.      She did not twist him living around her face,      But threw him coiled upon the path,      Upon which the great God wandered at ease      Through all his lands.\u201cThe venerable God stepped forth radiantly,      The gods who served Pharaoh accompanied him,      And he proceeded as every day.      Then the venerable worm stung him....      The divine God opened his mouth      And the voice of his majesty echoed even to the sky.      And the gods exclaimed: Behold!      Thereupon he could not answer,      His jaws chattered,      All his limbs trembled      And the poison gripped his flesh,      As the Nile seizes upon the land.\u201dIn this hymn Egypt has again preserved for us a primitive conception of the serpent\u2019s sting. The aging of the autumn sun as an image of human senility is symbolically traced back to the mother through the poisoning by the serpent. The mother is reproached, because her malice causes the death of the sun-god. The serpent, the primitive symbol of fear,[615] illustrates the repressed tendency to turn back to the mother, because the only possibility of security from death is possessed by the mother, as the source of life.Accordingly, only the mother can cure him, sick unto death, and, therefore, the hymn goes on to depict how the gods were assembled to take counsel:",
