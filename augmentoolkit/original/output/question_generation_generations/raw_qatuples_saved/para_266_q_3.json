    "paragraph": "parallel to the substitution of the missing phallus of Osiris. Mithra is represented in a special ceremony, holding the bull\u2019s shoulder over Sol, his son and vice-regent. This scene may be compared to a sort of dedication, or accolade (something like the ceremony of confirmation). The blow of the hammer as a generating, fructifying, inspiring function is retained as a folk-custom and expressed by striking with the twig of life, which has the significance of a charm of fertility. In the neuroses, the sexual meaning of castigation plays an important part, for among many children castigation may elicit a sexual orgasm. The ritual act of striking has the same significance of generating (fructifying), and is, indeed, merely a variant of the original phallic ceremonial. Of similar character to the bull\u2019s shoulder is the cloven hoof of the devil, to which a sexual meaning also appertains. The ass\u2019s jawbone wielded by Samson has the same worth. In the Polynesian Maui myth the jawbone, the weapon of the hero, is derived from the man-eating woman, Muriranga-whenua, whose body swells up enormously from lusting for human flesh (Frobenius). Hercules\u2019 club is made from the wood of the maternal olive tree. Faust\u2019s key also \u201cknows the mothers.\u201d The libido springs from the mother, and with this weapon alone can man overcome death.",

    "question": "How does the Polynesian Maui myth relate to the sexual meaning of castigation and weapons in rituals?\n\n**ANSWORD:**\nIn the Polynesian Maui myth, the jawbone, the weapon of the hero, is derived from a man-eating woman named Muriranga-whenua, whose body swells up enormously due to a lust for human flesh (Frobenius). This myth underscores the sexual and generative significance of the weapon, highlighting how it represents both the source of life and the means to overcome death.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the connection between the club of Hercules and the maternal olive tree, and how does it relate to the concept of overcoming death?",
    "answer": "Hercules\u2019 club is made from the wood of the maternal olive tree, symbolizing the connection to the maternal source of life. This weapon, with its maternal origin, is the only one that can overcome death, reflecting the idea that the libido, which springs from the mother, is the key to overcoming mortality and achieving a generative, life-affirming force.",
