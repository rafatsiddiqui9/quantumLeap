    "paragraph": "With this we turn back to the question from which we digressed, namely, whether or not Miss Miller has created something valuable with her poem. If we bear in mind under what psychologic or moral conditions Christianity came into existence; that is to say, at a time when fierce brutality was an every-day spectacle, then we understand the religious seizure of the whole personality and the worth of that religion which defended the people of the Roman culture against the visible storms of wickedness. It was not difficult for those people to remain conscious of sin, for they saw it every day spread out before their eyes. The religious product was at that time the accomplishment of the total personality. Miss Miller not only undervalues her \u201csins,\u201d but the connection between the \u201cdepressing and unrelenting need\u201d and her religious product has even escaped her. Thus her poetical creation completely loses the living value of a religious product. It is not much more than a sentimental transformation of the erotic which is secretly carried out close to consciousness and principally possesses the same worth as the manifest content of the dream[99] with its uncertain and delusive perishableness. Thus the poem is properly only a dream become audible.",

    "question": "What does the author suggest about the worth of Miss Miller's poem in comparison to historical religious products?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that Miss Miller's poem lacks the living value of a religious product that emerged from historical conditions of brutality and wickedness. While her poem may have some emotional or sensual content, it is not as meaningful or transformative as the religious products that arose from the need to defend against and reflect on widespread violence and sin in early Christian times.",
