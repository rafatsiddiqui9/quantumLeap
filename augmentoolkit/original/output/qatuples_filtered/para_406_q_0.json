    "paragraph": "(35) \u201cFor I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and  the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her  mother-in-law.(36) \u201cAnd a man\u2019s foes shall be they of his own household.(37) \u201cHe that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of  me.\u201dOr _Luke_, chap. xii, v. 51:\u201cSuppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay:  but rather division.(52) \u201cFor from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,  three against two, and two against three.(53) \u201cThe father shall be divided against the son, and the son against  the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against  the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the  daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.\u201dHorus snatched from his mother her head adornment, the power. Just as Adam struggled with Lilith, so he struggles for power. Nietzsche, in \u201cHuman, All Too Human,\u201d expressed the same in very beautiful words:\u201cOne may suppose that a mind, in which the \u2018type of free mind\u2019 is to  ripen and sweeten at maturity, has had its decisive crisis in a great  detachment, so that before this time it was just so much the more a  fettered spirit and appeared chained forever to its corner and its  pillar.[629] What binds it most firmly? What cords are almost  untearable? Among human beings of a high and exquisite type, it would  be duties: that reverence, which is suitable for youth, that modesty  and tenderness for all the old honored and valued things, that  thankfulness for the earth from which they grew, for the hand which  guided them, for the shrine where they learnt to pray:\u2014their loftiest  moments themselves come to bind them the firmest, to obligate them the  most permanently. The great detachment comes suddenly for people so  bound.",

    "question": "Based on the biblical passage, what does Jesus say about the division within a household?",
    "answer": "According to the biblical passage, Jesus states that a man's foes will be those of his own household. He explains that there will be division within the family, where a father may be against his son, a mother against her daughter, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. This indicates that the core relationships within a family can become strained.",
