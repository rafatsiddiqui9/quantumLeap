Experience forces us to the assumption of a\ncapacity for displacement of the libido, because functions or\nlocalizations of non-sexual force are undoubtedly capable of taking up a\ncertain amount of libidinous sexual impetus, a libidinous afflux.[238]\nFunctions or objects could, therefore, obtain sexual value, which under\nnormal circumstances really have nothing to do with sexuality.[239] From\nthis fact results the Freudian comparison of the libido with a stream,\nwhich is divisible, which can be dammed up, which overflows into\nbranches, and so on.[240] Freud’s original conception does not interpret\n“everything sexual,” although this has been asserted by critics, but\nrecognizes the existence of certain forces, the nature of which are not\nwell known; to which Freud, however, compelled by the notorious facts\nwhich are evident to any layman, grants the capacity to receive\n“affluxes of libido.” The hypothetical idea at the basis is the symbol\nof the “Triebbündel”[241] (bundle of impulses), wherein the sexual\nimpulse figures as a partial impulse of the whole system, and its\nencroachment into the other realms of impulse is a fact of experience.\nThe theory of Freud, branching off from this interpretation, according\nto which the motor forces of a neurotic system correspond precisely to\ntheir libidinous additions to other (non-sexual) functional impulses,\nhas been sufficiently proven as correct, it seems to me, by the work of\nFreud and his school.[242] Since the appearance of the “Three\nContributions,” in 1905, a change has taken place[243] in the libido\nconception; its field of application has been widened. An extremely\nclear example of this amplification is this present work. However, I\nmust state that Freud, as well as myself, saw the need of widening the\nconception of libido. It was paranoia, so closely related to dementia\npræcox, which seemed to compel Freud to enlarge the earlier limits of\nthe conception. The passage in question, which I will quote here, word\nfor word, reads:[244]\n\n  “A third consideration which presents itself, in regard to the views\n  developed here, starts the query as to whether we should accept as\n  sufficiently effectual the universal receding of the libido from the\n  outer world, in order to interpret from that, the end of the world: or\n  whether in this case, the firmly rooted possession of the ‘I’ must not\n  suffice to uphold the rapport with the outer world. Then one must\n  either let that which we call possession of the libido (interest from\n  erotic sources) coincide with interest in general, or else take into\n  consideration the possibility that great disturbance in the\n  disposition of the libido can also induce a corresponding disturbance\n  in the possession of the ‘I.’ Now, these are the problems, which we\n  are still absolutely helpless and unfitted to answer. Things would be\n  different could we proceed from a safe fund of knowledge of instinct.\n  But the truth is, we have nothing of that kind at our disposal. We\n  understand instinct as the resultant of the reaction of the somatic\n  and the psychic. We see in it the psychical representation of organic\n  forces and take the popular distinction between the ‘I’ impulse and\n  the sexual impulse, which appears to us to be in accord with the\n  biological double rôle of the individual being who aspires to his own\n  preservation as well as to the preservation of the species. But\n  anything beyond this is a structure, which we set up, and also\n  willingly let fall again in order to orient ourselves in the confusion\n  of the dark processes of the soul; we expect particularly, from the\n  psychoanalytic investigations into diseased soul processes, to have\n  certain decisions forced upon us in regard to questions of the theory\n  of instinct. This expectation has not yet been fulfilled on account of\n  the still immature and limited investigations in these fields. At\n  present the possibility of the reaction of libido disturbance upon the\n  possession of the ‘I’ can be shown as little as the reverse; the\n  secondary or induced disturbances of the libido processes through\n  abnormal changes in the ‘I.’ It is probable that processes of this\n  sort form the distinctive character of the psychoses. The conclusions\n  arising from this, in relation to paranoia, are at present uncertain.\n  One cannot assert that the paranoiac has completely withdrawn his\n  interest from the outer world, nor withdrawn into the heights of\n  repression, as one sometimes sees in certain other forms of\n  hallucinatory psychoses. He takes notice of the outer world, he takes\n  account of its changes, he is stirred to explanations by their\n  influence, and therefore I consider it highly probable that the\n  changed relation to the world is to be explained, wholly or in great\n  part, by the deficiency of the libido interest.”\n\nIn this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question whether the\nwell-known longing for reality of the paranoic dement (and the dementia\npræcox patients),[245] to whom I have especially called attention in my\nbook, “The Psychology of Dementia Præcox,”[246] is to be traced back to\nthe withdrawal of the “libidinous affluxes” alone, or whether this\ncoincides with the so-called objective interest in general. It is hardly\nto be assumed that the normal “fonction du réel” (Janet)[247] is\nmaintained only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest. The fact\nis that in very many cases reality disappears entirely, so that not a\ntrace of psychological adaptation or orientation can be recognized.\nReality is repressed under these circumstances and replaced by the\ncontents of the complex. One must of necessity say that not only the\nerotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared, that is to\nsay, the whole adaptation to reality has ceased. To this category belong\nthe stuporose and catatonic automatons.\n\nI have previously made use of the expression “psychic energy” in my\n“Psychology of Dementia Præcox” because I was unable to establish the\ntheory of this psychosis upon the conception of the displacement of the\naffluxes of libido. My experience, at that time chiefly psychiatric, did\nnot enable me to understand this theory. However, the correctness of\nthis theory in regard to neuroses, strictly speaking the transference\nneuroses, was proven to me later after increased experience in the field\nof hysteria and compulsion neuroses. In the territory of these neuroses\nit is mainly a question whether any portion of the libido which is\nspared through the specific repression becomes introverted and\nregressive into earlier paths of transference; for example, the path of\nthe parental transference.[248] With that, however, the former\nnon-sexual psychologic adaptation to the environment remains preserved\nso far as it does not concern the erotic and its secondary positions\n(symptoms). The reality which is lacking to the patients is just that\nportion of the libido to be found in the neurosis. In dementia præcox,\non the contrary, not merely that portion of libido which is saved in the\nwell-known specific sexual repression is lacking for reality, but much\nmore than one could write down to the account of sexuality in a strict\nsense. The function of reality is lacking to such a degree that even the\nmotive power must be encroached upon in the loss. The sexual character\nof this must be disputed absolutely,[249] for reality is not understood\nto be a sexual function. Moreover, if that were so, the introversion of\nthe libido in the strict sense must have as a result a loss of reality\nin the neuroses, and, indeed, a loss which could be compared with that\nof dementia præcox. These facts have rendered it impossible for me to\ntransfer Freud’s theory of libido to dementia præcox, and, therefore, I\nam of the opinion that Abraham’s investigation[250] is hardly tenable\ntheoretically, from the standpoint of the Freudian theory of libido. If\nAbraham believes that through the withdrawal of the libido from the\nouter world the paranoid system or the schizophrenic symptomatology\nresults, then this assumption is not justified from the standpoint of\nthe knowledge of that time, because a mere libido introversion and\nregression leads, speedily, as Freud has clearly shown, into the\nneuroses, and, strictly speaking, into the transference neuroses, and\nnot into dementia præcox. Therefore, the transference of the libido\ntheory to dementia præcox is impossible, because this illness produces a\nloss of reality which cannot be explained by the deficiency of the\nlibido defined in this narrow sense.\n\nIt affords me especial satisfaction that our teacher also, when he laid\nhis hand on the delicate material of the paranoic psychology, was forced\nto doubt the applicability of the conception of libido held by him at\nthat time. The sexual definition of this did not permit me to understand\nthose disturbances of function, which affect the vague territory of the\nhunger instinct just as much as that of the sexual instinct. For a long\ntime the theory of libido seemed to me inapplicable to dementia præcox.\nWith increasing experience in analytical work, however, I became aware\nof a gradual change in my conception of libido. In place of the\ndescriptive definition of the “Three Contributions” there gradually grew\nup a generic definition of the libido, which rendered it possible for me\nto replace the expression “psychic energy” by the term “libido.” I was\nforced to ask myself whether indeed the function of reality to-day does\nnot consist only in its smaller part of libido sexualis and in the\ngreater part of other impulses? It is still a very important question\nwhether phylogenetically the function of reality is not, at least in\ngreat part, of sexual origin. To answer this question directly in regard\nto the function of reality is not possible, but we shall attempt to come\nto an understanding indirectly.",
