    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ the mythical king who rules in Egyptian Thebes and whose wife was appropriately\
    \ named Thebe. The Bœotian Thebes founded by Cadmus received on that account a\
    \ surname, “Ogygian.” This surname was also given to the great flood, as it was\
    \ called “Ogygian” because it occurred under Ogyges. This coincidence will be\
    \ found later on to be hardly accidental. The fact that the city and the wife\
    \ of Ogyges bear the same name indicates that somewhere a relation must exist\
    \ between the city and the woman, which is not difficult to understand, for the\
    \ city is identical with the woman. We meet a similar idea in Hindoo lore where\
    \ Indra appears as the husband of Urvara, but Urvara means “the fertile land.”\
    \ In a similar way the occupancy of a country by the king was understood as marriage\
    \ with the ploughed land. Similar representations must have prevailed in Europe\
    \ as well. Princes had to guarantee, for example, a good harvest at their accession.\
    \ The Swedish King Domaldi was actually killed on account of the failure of the\
    \ harvest (Ynglinga sâga 18). In the Rama sâga the hero Rama marries Sîtâ, the\
    \ furrow of the field.[424] To the same group of ideas belongs the Chinese custom\
    \ of the Emperor ploughing a furrow at his ascension to the throne. This idea\
    \ of the soil being feminine also embraces the idea of continual companionship\
    \ with the woman, a physical communication. Shiva, the Phallic God, is, like Mahadeva\
    \ and Parwati, male and female. He has even given one-half of his body to his\
    \ consort Parwati as a dwelling place.[425] Inman[426] gives us a drawing of a\
    \ Pundite of Ardanari-Iswara; one-half of the god is masculine, the other half\
    \ feminine, and the genitals are in continuous cohabitation. The motive of continuous\
