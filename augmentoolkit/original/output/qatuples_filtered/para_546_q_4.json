    "paragraph": "The double significance of the tree is readily explained by the fact that such symbols are not to be understood \u201canatomically\u201d but psychologically as libido symbols; therefore, it is not permissible to interpret the tree on account of its similar form as directly phallic; it can also be called a woman or the uterus of the mother. The uniformity of the significance lies alone in the similarity to the libido.[451] One loses one\u2019s way in one \u201ccul de sac\u201d after another by saying that this is the symbol substituted for the mother and that for the penis. In this realm there is no fixed significance of things. The only reality here is the libido, for which \u201call that is perishable is merely a symbol.\u201d It is not the physical actual mother, but the libido of the son, the object of which was once the mother. We take mythologic symbols much too concretely and wonder at every step about the endless contradictions. These contradictions arise only because we constantly forget that in the realm of phantasy \u201cfeeling is all.\u201d Whenever we read, therefore, \u201chis mother was a wicked sorcerer,\u201d the translation is as follows: The son is in love with her, namely, he is unable to detach his libido from the mother-imago; he therefore suffers from incestuous resistance.The symbolism of water and trees, which are met with as further attributes in the symbol of the City, also refer to that amount of libido which unconsciously is fastened to the mother-imago. In certain parts of Revelation the unconscious psychology of religious longing is revealed, namely, the longing for the _mother_.[452] The expectation of Revelation ends in the mother: \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f14\u03c4\u03b9 (\u201cand there shall be no more curse\u201d). There shall be no more sins, no repression, no disharmony with one\u2019s self, no guilt, no fear of death and no pain of separation more!",

    "question": "What does the author suggest is the religious longing expressed in certain parts of Revelation?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that certain parts of Revelation reveal the unconscious psychological longing for the mother. This longing is a deep emotional need rooted in the psyche, and it reflects the child's attachment to the mother figure. The author believes that the expectation of Revelation ends in the fulfillment of this longing, symbolized by the absence of curses, sins, repression, guilt, fear of death, and pain of separation.",
