{"paragraph": "\u201cFaint with famine, Hiawatha          Started from his bed of branches,          From the twilight of his wigwam          Forth into the flush of sunset          Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;          At his touch he felt new courage          Throbbing in his brain and bosom,          Felt new life and hope and vigor          Run through every nerve and fibre.\u201dThe battle at sunset with the god of the maize gives Hiawatha new strength; and thus it must be, because the fight for the individual depths, against the paralyzing longing for the mother, gives creative strength to men. Here, indeed, is the source of all creation, but it demands heroic courage to fight against these forces and to wrest from them the \u201ctreasure difficult to attain.\u201d He who succeeds in this has, in truth, attained the best. Hiawatha wrestles with himself for his creation.[655] The struggle lasts again the charmed three days. The fourth day, just as Mondamin prophesied, Hiawatha conquers him, and Mondamin sinks to the ground in death. As Mondamin previously desired, Hiawatha digs his grave in mother earth, and soon afterwards from this grave the young and fresh maize grows for the nourishment of mankind.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
