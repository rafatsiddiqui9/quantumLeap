    "paragraph": "The deadly arrows do not strike the hero from without, but it is he himself who, in disharmony with himself, hunts, fights and tortures himself. Within himself will has turned against will, libido against libido\u2014therefore, the poet says, \u201cPierced through thyself,\u201d that is to say, wounded by his own arrow. Because we have discerned that the arrow is a libido symbol, the idea of \u201cpenetrating or piercing through\u201d consequently becomes clear to us. It is a phallic act of union with one\u2019s self, a sort of self-fertilization (introversion); also a self-violation, a self-murder; therefore, Zarathustra may call himself his own hangman, like Odin, who sacrifices himself to Odin.The wounding by one\u2019s own arrow means, first of all, _the state of introversion_. What this signifies we already know\u2014the libido sinks into its \u201cown depths\u201d (a well-known comparison of Nietzsche\u2019s) and finds there below, in the shadows of the unconscious, the substitute for the upper world, which it has abandoned: _the world of memories_ (\u201c\u2019mid a hundred memories\u201d), the strongest and most influential of which are the early infantile memory pictures. It is the world of the child, this paradise-like state of earliest childhood, from which we are separated by a hard law. In this subterranean kingdom slumber sweet feelings of home and the endless hopes of all that is to be. As Heinrich in the \u201cSunken Bell,\u201d by Gerhart Hauptmann, says, in speaking of his miraculous work:\u201cThere is a song lost and forgotten,       A song of home, a love song of childhood,       Brought up from the depths of the fairy well,       Known to all, but yet unheard.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the term \"introversion\" signify in the context provided?",
    "answer": "In the context provided, \"introversion\" signifies a state where libido sinks into its \"own depths,\" or the unconscious. This leads to finding a substitute for the upper world, which the person has abandoned, in the form of memories, particularly from early childhood. It is a journey into the subconscious where sweet feelings of home and endless hopes reside.",
