Jamais plus, jamais mes yeux grisés,\n           Mes regards dont c’était les frémissantes fêtes,\n           Ne baiseront au vol les gestes que vous faites;\n           J’en revois un petit qui vous est familier\n           Pour toucher votre front et je voudrais crier—.\n                 Et je crie:\n           Adieu!—Ma chère, ma chérie,\n           Mon trésor—mon amour!\n           Mon coeur ne vous quitta jamais une seconde,\n           Et je suis et je serai jusque dans l’autre monde\n           Celui qui vous aime sans mesure, celui—”\n\nWhereupon Roxane recognizes in him the real loved one. It is already too\nlate; death comes; and in agonized delirium, Cyrano raises himself, and\ndraws his sword:\n\n               “Je crois, qu’elle regarde....\n               Qu’elle ose regarder mon nez, la camarde!\n\n                          (Il lève son épée.)\n\n        Que dites-vous?... C’est inutile!\n              Je le sais!\n        Mais on ne se bat pas dans l’espoir du succès!\n        Non! Non! C’est bien plus beau, lorsque c’est inutile!\n        —Qu’est-ce que c’est que tous ceux-là?—Vous êtes mille?\n        Ah! je vous reconnais, tous mes vieux ennemis!\n        Le mensonge!\n\n                    (Il frappe de son épée le vide.)\n\n                  Tiens, tiens, ha! ha! les Compromis,\n                  Les Préjugés, les Lâchetés!...\n\n                              (Il frappe.)\n\n               Que je pactise?\n         Jamais, jamais!—Ah, te voilà, toi, la Sottise!\n         —Je sais bien qu’à la fin vous me mettrez à bas;\n         N’importe: je me bats! je me bats! je me bats!\n         Oui, vous m’arrachez tout, le laurier et la rose!\n         Arrachez! Il y a malgré vous quelque chose\n         Que j’emporte, et ce soir, quand j’entrerai chez Dieu,\n         Mon salut balaiera largement le seuil bleu.\n         Quelque chose que sans un pli, sans une tache,\n         J’emporte malgré vous, et c’est—mon panache.”\n\nCyrano, who under the hateful exterior of his body hid a soul so much\nmore beautiful, is a yearner and one misunderstood, and his last triumph\nis that he departs, at least, with a clean shield—“Sans un pli et sans\nune tache.” The identification of the author with the dying Christian,\nwho in himself is a figure but little impressive and sympathetic,\nexpresses clearly that a sudden end is destined for her love just as for\nChristian’s love. The tragic intermezzo with Christian, however, is\nplayed as we have seen upon a background of much wider significance,\nviz., the misunderstood love of Cyrano for Roxane. Therefore, the\nidentification with Christian has only the significance of a substitute\nmemory (“deckerinnerung”), and is really intended for Cyrano. That this\nis just what we might expect will be seen in the further course of our\nanalysis.\n\nBesides this story of identification with Christian, there follows as a\nfurther example an extraordinarily plastic memory of the sea, evoked by\nthe sight of a photograph of a steamboat on the high seas. (“Je sentis\nles pulsations des machines, le soulèvement des vagues, le balancement\ndu navire.”)\n\nWe may mention here the supposition that there are connected with sea\njourneys particularly impressive and strong memories which penetrate\ndeeply into the soul and give an especially strong character to the\nsurface memories through unconscious harmony. To what extent the\nmemories assumed here agree with the above mentioned problem we shall\nsee in the following pages.\n\nThis example, following at this time, is singular: Once, while in\nbathing, Miss Miller wound a towel around her hair, in order to protect\nit from a wetting. At the same moment she had the following strong\nimpression:\n\n  “Il me sembla que j’étais sur un piédestal, une véritable statue\n  égyptienne, avec tous ses détails: membres raides, un pied en avant,\n  la main tenant des insignes,” and so on.\n\nMiss Miller identified herself, therefore, with an Egyptian statue, and\nnaturally the foundation for this was a subjective pretension. That is\nto say, “I am like an Egyptian statue, just as stiff, wooden, sublime\nand impassive,” qualities for which the Egyptian statue is proverbial.\nOne does not make such an assertion to one’s self without an inner\ncompulsion, and the correct formula might just as well be, “as stiff,\nwooden, etc., as an Egyptian statue I might indeed be.” The sight of\none’s own unclothed body in a bath has undeniable effects for the\nphantasy, which can be set at rest by the above formula.[58]\n\nThe example which follows this, emphasizes the author’s personal\ninfluence upon an artist:\n\n  “J’ai réussi à lui faire rendre des paysages, comme ceux du lac Léman,\n  où il n’a jamais été, et il prétendait que je pouvais lui faire rendre\n  des choses qu’il n’avait jamais vues, et lui donner la sensation d’une\n  atmosphère ambiante qu’il n’avait jamais sentie; bref que je me\n  servais de lui comme lui-même se servait de son crayon, c’est à dire\n  comme d’un simple instrument.”\n\nThis observation stands in abrupt contrast to the phantasy of the\nEgyptian statue. Miss Miller had here the unspoken need of emphasizing\nher almost magic effect upon another person. This could not have\nhappened, either, without an unconscious need, which is particularly\nfelt by one who does not often succeed in making an emotional impression\nupon a fellow being.\n\nWith that, the list of examples which are to picture Miss Miller’s\nautosuggestibility and suggestive effect, is exhausted. In this respect,\nthe examples are neither especially striking nor interesting. From an\nanalytical viewpoint, on the contrary, they are much more important,\nsince they afford us a glance into the soul of the writer. Ferenczi[59]\nhas taught us in an excellent work what is to be thought about\nsuggestibility, that is to say, that these phenomena win new aspects in\nthe light of the Freudian libido theory, in so much as their effects\nbecome clear through “Libido-besetzungen.” This was already indicated\nabove in the discussion of the examples, and in the greatest detail\nregarding the identification with Christian. The identification becomes\neffective by its receiving an influx of energy from the strongly\naccentuated thought and emotional feeling underlying the Christian\nmotif. Just the reverse is the suggestive effect of the individual in an\nespecial capacity for concentrating interest (that is to say, libido)\nupon another person, by which the other is unconsciously compelled to\nreaction (the same or opposed). The majority of the examples concern\ncases where Miss Miller is put under the effects of suggestion; that is\nto say, when the libido has spontaneously gained possession of certain\nimpressions, and this is impossible if the libido is dammed up to an\nunusual degree by the lack of application to reality. Miss Miller’s\nobservations about suggestibility inform us, therefore, of the fact that\nthe author is pleased to tell us in her following phantasies something\nof the history of her love.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER III\n                          THE HYMN OF CREATION\n\n\nThe second chapter in Miss Miller’s work is entitled, “Gloire à Dieu.\nPoème onirique.”\n\nWhen twenty years of age, Miss Miller took a long journey through\nEurope. We leave the description of it to her:\n\n  “After a long and rough journey from New York to Stockholm, from there\n  to Petersburg and Odessa, I found it a true pleasure[60] to leave the\n  world of inhabited cities—and to enter the world of waves, sky and\n  silence—I stayed hours long on deck to dream, stretched out in a\n  reclining chair. The histories, legends and myths of the different\n  countries which I saw in the distance, came back to me indistinctly\n  blended together in a sort of luminous mist, in which things lost\n  their reality, while the dreams and thoughts alone took on somewhat\n  the appearance of reality. At first, I even avoided all company and\n  kept to myself, lost wholly in my dreams, where all that I knew of\n  great, beautiful and good came back into my consciousness with new\n  strength and new life. I also employed a great part of my time writing\n  to my distant friends, reading and sketching out short poems about the\n  regions visited. Some of these poems were of a very serious\n  character.”\n\nIt may seem superfluous, perhaps, to enter intimately into all these\ndetails. If we recall, however, the remark made above,—that when people\nlet their unconscious speak, they always tell us the most important\nthings of their intimate selves—then even the smallest detail appears to\nhave meaning. Valuable personalities invariably tell us, through their\nunconscious, things that are generally valuable, so that patient\ninterest is rewarded.\n\nMiss Miller describes here a state of “introversion.” After the life of\nthe cities with their many impressions had been absorbing her interest\n(with that already discussed strength of suggestion which powerfully\nenforced the impression) she breathed freely upon the ocean, and after\nso many external impressions, became engrossed wholly in the internal\nwith intentional abstraction from the surroundings, so that things lost\ntheir reality and dreams became truth. We know from psychopathology that\ncertain mental disturbances[61] exist which are first manifested by the\nindividuals shutting themselves off slowly, more and more, from reality\nand sinking into their phantasies, during which process, in proportion\nas the reality loses its hold, the inner world gains in reality and\ndetermining power.[62] This process leads to a certain point (which\nvaries with the individual) when the patients suddenly become more or\nless conscious of their separation from reality. The event which then\nenters is the pathological excitation: that is to say, the patients\nbegin to turn towards the environment, with diseased views (to be sure)\nwhich, however, still represent the compensating, although unsuccessful,\nattempt at transference.[63] The methods of reaction are, naturally,\nvery different. I will not concern myself more closely about this here.\n\nThis type appears to be generally a psychological rule which holds good\nfor all neuroses and, therefore, also for the normal in a much less\ndegree. We might, therefore, expect that Miss Miller, after this\nenergetic and persevering introversion, which had even encroached for a\ntime upon the feeling of reality, would succumb anew to an impression of\nthe real world and also to just as suggestive and energetic an influence\nas that of her dreams. Let us proceed with the narrative:\n\n  “But as the journey drew to an end, the ship’s officers outdid\n  themselves in kindness (tout ce qu’il y a de plus empressé et de plus\n  aimable) and I passed many amusing hours teaching them English. On the\n  Sicilian coast, in the harbor of Catania, I wrote a sailor’s song\n  which was very similar to a song well known on the sea, (Brine, wine\n  and damsels fine). The Italians in general all sing very well, and one\n  of the officers who sang on deck during night watch, had made a great\n  impression upon me and had given me the idea of writing some words\n  adapted to his melody. Soon after that, I was very nearly obliged to\n  reverse the well-known saying, ‘Veder Napoli e poi morir,’—that is to\n  say, suddenly I became very ill, although not dangerously so. I\n  recovered to such an extent, however, that I could go on land to visit\n  the sights of the city in a carriage. This day tired me very much, and\n  since we had planned to see Pisa the following day, I went on board\n  early in the evening and soon lay down to sleep without thinking of\n  anything more serious than the beauty of the officers and the ugliness\n  of the Italian beggars.”",
  "llm_raw_response": "The given text can be broken down into the following coherent sections by topic:\n\n**Section 1: Analysis of a Poem by Cyrano de Bergerac**\n\nThis section begins with a poem by Cyrano de Bergerac, where he expresses his love for Roxane and his desire to be with her. The poem is followed by a description of Cyrano's death, where he identifies himself with the dying Christian from the Bible. This identification is seen as a substitute memory and is intended to highlight Cyrano's own misunderstood love for Roxane.\n\n**Section 2: Analysis of Miss Miller's Autosuggestibility**\n\nThis section discusses Miss Miller's autosuggestibility and suggestive effect, using several examples to illustrate her tendency to identify herself with various objects or people. The examples include:\n\n* Miss Miller identifying herself with an Egyptian statue, where she feels stiff, wooden, and sublime.\n* Miss Miller's observation that she was able to make an artist create landscapes and atmospheres that she had never seen before, highlighting her almost magical effect on others.\n\n**Section 3: Analysis of Miss Miller's Journey through Europe**\n\nThis section describes Miss Miller's journey through Europe, where she takes a long journey from New York to Stockholm, Petersburg, and Odessa. During this journey, she experiences a state of \"introversion,\" where she becomes engrossed in her internal world and loses touch with reality. She writes poetry and sketches out short poems about the regions she visits, and describes a sailor's song that she writes on the Sicilian coast.\n\n**Section 4: Analysis of Miss Miller's Psychological State**\n\nThis section discusses Miss Miller's psychological state, where she experiences a pathological excitation after becoming more conscious of her separation from reality. The section also mentions that this type of psychological state is generally a rule for all neuroses and normal individuals in a lesser degree.\n\nOverall, the text can be seen as a collection of analytical sections that explore the psychological and literary themes of the works of Miss Miller and Cyrano de Bergerac.",
