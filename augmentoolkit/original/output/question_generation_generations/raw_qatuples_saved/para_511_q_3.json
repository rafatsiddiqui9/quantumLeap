    "paragraph": "Thus we understand why the Indian fire-bringer M\u00e2tari\u00e7van is called \u201cthe one swelling in the mother\u201d; the ark (little box, chest, cask, vessel, etc.) is a symbol of the womb, just as is the sea, into which the Sun sinks for rebirth. From this circle of ideas we understand the mythologic statements about Ogyges; he it is who possesses the mother, the City, who is united with the mother; therefore under him came the great flood, for it is a typical fragment of the sun myth that the hero, when united with the woman attained with difficulty, is exposed in a cask and thrown into the sea, and then lands for a new life on a distant shore. The middle part, the \u201cnight journey on the sea\u201d in the ark, is lacking in the tradition of Ogyges.[430] But the rule in mythology is that the typical parts of a myth can be united in all conceivable variations, which adds greatly to the extraordinary difficulty of the interpretation of a particular myth without knowledge of all the others. The meaning of this cycle of myths mentioned here is clear; it is the longing _to attain rebirth through the return to the mother\u2019s womb, that is to say, to become as immortal as the sun_. This longing for the mother is frequently expressed in our holy scriptures.[431] I recall, particularly the place in the epistle to the Galatians, where it is said (iv:26):(26) \u201cBut Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us  all.(27) \u201cFor it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that beareth not: break  forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many  more children than she which hath an husband.(28) \u201cNow we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.(29) \u201cBut as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was  born after the spirit, even so it is now.",

    "question": "How does the text explain the longing for rebirth through the return to the mother\u2019s womb?",
    "answer": "The text explains that the longing for rebirth through the return to the mother\u2019s womb is a fundamental theme in many myths. This longing is symbolized by the journey of the hero in the ark, which represents a return to the womb for a new life. This theme is also expressed in religious texts, such as the epistle to the Galatians, where it is said that Jerusalem above, which is the mother of all, signifies a return to the spiritual womb for renewal and rebirth.",
