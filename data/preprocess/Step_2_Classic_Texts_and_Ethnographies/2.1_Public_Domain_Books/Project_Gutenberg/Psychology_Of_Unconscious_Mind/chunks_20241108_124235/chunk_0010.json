That\n  which once ruled in the waking state, when the psychical life was\n  still young and impotent, appears to be banished to the dream life, in\n  somewhat the same way as the bow and arrow, those discarded, primitive\n  weapons of adult humanity, have been relegated to the nursery.”[32]\n\nAll this experience suggests to us that we draw a parallel between the\nphantastical, mythological thinking of antiquity and the similar\nthinking of children, between the lower human races and dreams.[33] This\ntrain of thought is not a strange one for us, but quite familiar through\nour knowledge of comparative anatomy and the history of development,\nwhich show us how the structure and function of the human body are the\nresults of a series of embryonic changes which correspond to similar\nchanges in the history of the race. Therefore, the supposition is\njustified that ontogenesis corresponds in psychology to phylogenesis.\nConsequently, it would be true, as well, that the state of infantile\nthinking in the child’s psychic life, as well as in dreams, is nothing\nbut a re-echo of the prehistoric and the ancient.[34]\n\nIn regard to this, Nietzsche takes a very broad and remarkable\nstandpoint.[35]\n\n  “In our sleep and in our dreams we pass through the whole thought of\n  earlier humanity. I mean, in the same way that man reasons in his\n  dreams, he reasoned when in the waking state many thousands of years.\n  The first _causa_ which occurred to his mind in reference to anything\n  that needed explanation, satisfied him and passed for truth. In the\n  dream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within\n  us, for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty\n  developed, and which is still developing in every individual. The\n  dream carries us back into earlier states of human culture, and\n  affords us a means of understanding it better. The dream thought is so\n  easy to us now, because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the\n  interminable stages of evolution during which this phantastic and\n  facile form of theorizing has prevailed. To a certain extent the dream\n  is a restorative for the brain, which during the day is called upon to\n  meet the severe demands for trained thought, made by the conditions of\n  a higher civilization.\n\n  “From these facts, we can understand how lately more acute logical\n  thinking, the taking seriously of cause and effect, has been\n  developed; when our functions of reason and intelligence still reach\n  back involuntarily to those primitive forms of conclusion, and we live\n  about half our lives in this condition.”\n\nWe have already seen that Freud, independently of Nietzsche, has reached\na similar standpoint from the basis of dream analysis. The step from\nthis established proposition to the perception of the myths as familiar\ndream images is no longer a great one. Freud has formulated this\nconclusion himself.[36]\n\n  “The investigation of this folk-psychologic formation, myths, etc., is\n  by no means finished at present. To take an example of this, however,\n  it is probable that the myths correspond to the distorted residue of\n  wish phantasies of whole nations, the secularized dreams of young\n  humanity.”\n\nRank[37] understands the myths in a similar manner, as a mass dream of\nthe people.[38] Riklin[39] has insisted rightly upon the dream mechanism\nof the fables, and Abraham[40] has done the same for the myths. He says:\n\n  “The myth is a fragment of the infantile soul-life of the people.”\n\nand\n\n  “Thus the myth is a _sustained, still remaining_ fragment from the\n  infantile soul-life of the people, and the dream is the myth of the\n  individual.”\n\nAn unprejudiced reading of the above-mentioned authors will certainly\nallay all doubts concerning the intimate connection between dream\npsychology and myth psychology. The conclusion results almost from\nitself, that the age which created the myths thought childishly—that is\nto say, phantastically, as in our age is still done, to a very great\nextent (associatively or analogically) in dreams. The beginnings of myth\nformations (in the child), the taking of phantasies for realities, which\nis partly in accord with the historical, may easily be discovered among\nchildren.\n\nOne might raise the objection that the mythological inclinations of\nchildren are implanted by education. The objection is futile. Has\nhumanity at all ever broken loose from the myths? Every man has eyes and\nall his senses to perceive that the world is dead, cold and unending,\nand he has never yet seen a God, nor brought to light the existence of\nsuch from empirical necessity. On the contrary, there was need of a\nphantastic, indestructible optimism, and one far removed from all sense\nof reality, in order, for example, to discover in the shameful death of\nChrist really the highest salvation and the redemption of the world.\nThus one can indeed withhold from a child the substance of earlier myths\nbut not take from him the need for mythology. One can say, that should\nit happen that all traditions in the world were cut off with a single\nblow, then with the succeeding generation, the whole mythology and\nhistory of religion would start over again. Only a few individuals\nsucceed in throwing off mythology in a time of a certain intellectual\nsupremacy—the mass never frees itself. Explanations are of no avail;\nthey merely destroy a transitory form of manifestation, but not the\ncreating impulse.\n\nLet us again take up our earlier train of thought.\n\nWe spoke of the ontogenetic re-echo of the phylogenetic psychology among\nchildren, we saw that phantastic thinking is a characteristic of\nantiquity, of the child, and of the lower races; but now we know also\nthat our modern and adult man is given over in large part to this same\nphantastic thinking, which enters as soon as the directed thinking\nceases. A lessening of the interest, a slight fatigue, is sufficient to\nput an end to the directed thinking, the exact psychological adaptation\nto the real world, and to replace it with phantasies. We digress from\nthe theme and give way to our own trains of thought; if the slackening\nof the attention increases, then we lose by degrees the consciousness of\nthe present, and the phantasy enters into possession of the field.\n\nHere the important question obtrudes itself: How are phantasies created?\nFrom the poets we learn much about it; from science we learn little. The\npsychoanalytic method, presented to science by Freud, shed light upon\nthis for the first time. It showed us that there are typical cycles. The\nstutterer imagines he is a great orator. The truth of this, Demosthenes,\nthanks to his energy, has proven. The poor man imagines himself to be a\nmillionaire, the child an adult. The conquered fight out victorious\nbattles with the conquerer; the unfit torments or delights himself with\nambitious plans. We imagine that which we lack. The interesting question\nof the “why” of all this we must here leave unanswered, while we return\nto the historic problem: From what source do the phantasies draw their\nmaterials?[41] We chose, as an example, a typical phantasy of puberty. A\nchild in that stage before whom the whole frightening uncertainty of the\nfuture fate opens, puts back the uncertainty into the past, through his\nphantasy, and says, “If only I were not the child of my ordinary\nparents, but the child of a rich and fashionable count, and had been\nmerely passed over to my parents, then some day a golden coach would\ncome, and the count would take his child back with him to his wonderful\ncastle,” and so it goes on, as in Grimm’s Fairy Tales which the mother\ntells to her children.[42] With a normal child, it stops with the\nfugitive, quickly-passing idea which is soon covered over and forgotten.\nHowever, at one time, and that was in the ancient world of culture, the\nphantasy was an openly acknowledged institution. The heroes,—I recall\nRomulus and Remus, Semiramis, Moses and many others,—have been separated\nfrom their real parents.[43] Others are directly sons of gods, and the\nnoble races derive their family trees from heroes and gods. As one sees\nby this example, the phantasy of modern humanity is nothing but a\nre-echo of an old-folk-belief, which was very widespread originally.[44]\nThe ambitious phantasy chooses, among others, a form which is classic,\nand which once had a true meaning. The same thing holds good in regard\nto the sexual phantasy. In the preamble we have spoken of dreams of\nsexual assault: the robber who breaks into the house and commits a\ndangerous act. That, too, is a mythological theme, and in the\nprehistoric era was certainly a reality too.[45] Wholly apart from the\nfact that the capture of women was something general in the lawless\nprehistoric times, it was also a subject of mythology in cultivated\nepochs. I recall the capture of Proserpina, Deianira, Europa, the Sabine\nwomen, etc. We must not forget that, even to-day, marriage customs exist\nin various regions which recall the ancient custom of marriage by\ncapture.\n\nThe symbolism of the instrument of coitus was an inexhaustible material\nfor ancient phantasy. It furnished a widespread cult that was designated\nphallic, the object of reverence of which was the phallus. The companion\nof Dionysus was Phales, a personification of the phallus proceeding from\nthe phallic Herme of Dionysus. The phallic symbols were countless. Among\nthe Sabines, the custom existed for the bridegroom to part the bride’s\nhair with a lance. The bird, the fish and the snake were phallic\nsymbols. In addition, there existed in enormous quantities theriomorphic\nrepresentations of the sexual instinct, in connection with which the\nbull, the he-goat, the ram, the boar and the ass were frequently used.\nAn undercurrent to this choice of symbol was furnished by the sodomitic\ninclination of humanity. When in the dream phantasy of modern man, the\nfeared man is replaced by an animal, there is recurring in the\nontogenetic re-echo the same thing which was openly represented by the\nancients countless times. There were he-goats which pursued nymphs,\nsatyrs with she-goats; in still older times in Egypt there even existed\na shrine of a goat god, which the Greeks called Pan, where the\nHierodules prostituted themselves with goats.[46] It is well known that\nthis worship has not died out, but continues to live as a special custom\nin South Italy and Greece.[47]\n\nTo-day we feel for such a thing nothing but the deepest abhorrence, and\nnever would admit it still slumbered in our souls. Nevertheless, just as\ntruly as the idea of the sexual assault is there, so are these things\nthere too; which we should contemplate still more closely,—not through\nmoral eye-glasses, with horror, but with interest as a natural science,\nsince these things are venerable relics of past culture periods. We\nhave, even to-day, a clause in our penal code against sodomy. But that\nwhich was once so strong as to give rise to a worship among a highly\ndeveloped people has probably not wholly disappeared from the human soul\nduring the course of a few generations. We may not forget that since the\nsymposium of Plato, in which homo-sexuality faces us on the same level\nwith the so-called “normal sexuality,” only eighty generations have\npassed. And what are eighty generations? They shrink to an imperceptible\nperiod of time when compared with the space of time which separates us\nfrom the homo-Neandertalensis or Heidelbergensis. I might call to mind,\nin this connection, some choice thoughts of the great historian\nGuglielmo Ferrero:[48]\n\n  “It is a very common belief that the further man is separated from the\n  present by time, the more does he differ from us in his thoughts and\n  feelings; that the psychology of humanity changes from century to\n  century, like fashions of literature. Therefore, no sooner do we find\n  in past history an institution, a custom, a law or a belief a little\n  different from those with which we are familiar, than we immediately\n  search for some complex meanings, which frequently resolve themselves\n  into phrases of doubtful significance.\n\n  “Indeed, man does not change so quickly; his psychology at bottom\n  remains the same, and even if his culture varies much from one epoch\n  to another, it does not change the functioning of his mind. The\n  fundamental laws of the mind remain the same, at least during the\n  short historical period of which we have knowledge, and all phenomena,\n  even the most strange, must be capable of explanation by those common\n  laws of the mind which we can recognize in ourselves.”",
