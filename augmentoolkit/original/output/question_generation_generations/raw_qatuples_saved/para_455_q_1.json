    "paragraph": "After the birth the four genii of the East, West, South and North come to render service as bearers of the palanquin. (The coming of the wise men at Christ\u2019s birth.) We also find here a distinct reference to the \u201cfour winds.\u201d For the completion of the symbolism there is to be found in the Buddha myth, as well as in the birth legend of Christ, besides the impregnation by star and wind, also the fertilization by an animal, here an elephant, which with its phallic trunk fulfilled in Maya the Christian method of fructification through the ear or the head. It is well known that, in addition to the dove, the unicorn is also a procreative symbol of the Logos.Here arises the question why the birth of a hero always had to take place under such strange symbolic circumstances? It might also be imagined that a hero arose from ordinary surroundings and gradually grew out of his inferior environment, perhaps with a thousand troubles and dangers. (And, indeed, this motive is by no means strange in the hero myth.) It might be said that superstition demands strange conditions of birth and generation; but why does it demand them?",

    "question": "How does the text explain the presence of such strange symbolic circumstances in the birth of a hero?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that the birth of a hero often involves strange symbolic circumstances to emphasize the extraordinary nature of the hero's origin. It posits that a hero could also arise from ordinary surroundings and gradually grow out of his inferior environment, perhaps with many troubles and dangers. However, the text questions why superstition demands strange conditions of birth and generation, implying that these circumstances serve a deeper symbolic purpose.",
