    "paragraph": "A Gnostic gem has been preserved upon which there is a representation of an ass suckling her foal, above which is the symbol of Cancer, and the circumscription D.N.I.H.Y.X.P.S.: Dominus Noster Jesus Christus, with the supplement Dei filius. As Justinus Martyr indignantly observes, the connections of the Christian legend with that of Dionysus are unmistakable. (Compare, for example, the miracle of the wine.) In the last-named legend the ass plays an important r\u00f4le. Generally speaking, the ass has an entirely different meaning in the Mediterranean countries than with us\u2014an economic one. Therefore, it is a benediction when Jacob says (Genesis, chap. xlix, verse 14):\u201cIssachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens.\u201dThe above-mentioned thought is altogether Oriental. Just as in Egypt the new-born sun is a bull-calf, in the rest of the Orient it can easily be an ass\u2019s foal, to whom the vine is the nurse. Hence the picture in the blessing of Jacob, where it is said of Judah:\u201cHis eyes are ruddy with wine and his teeth white with milk.\u201dThe mock crucifix of the Palatine, with an ass\u2019s head, evidently alludes to a very significant background._To Nature._\u201cWhile about thy veil I lingered, playing,      And, like any bud, upon thee hung,[790]     Still I felt thy heart in every straying      Sound about my heart that shook and clung.     While I groped with faith and painful yearning,      To your picture, glowing and unfurled,     Still I found a place for all my burning      Tears, and for my love I found a world!",

    "question": "How does the meaning of the ass differ between Mediterranean countries and other regions?",
    "answer": "In Mediterranean countries, the ass has an economic significance, but in other regions, it can symbolize spiritual or mythological concepts. For example, in certain contexts, the ass can represent a nurturing figure, such as the ass\u2019s foal being a nursling of the vine.",
