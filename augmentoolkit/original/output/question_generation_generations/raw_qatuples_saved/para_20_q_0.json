    "paragraph": "Now, amusing to relate, Mama hurried to his help. It is a peculiar fact that the woodpecker was also the \u201cMama\u201d of Romulus and Remus, who put nourishment into the mouths of the twins with his beak.[690] (Compare with that the r\u00f4le of the vulture in Leonardo\u2019s dream. The vulture is sacred to Mars, like the woodpecker.) With the maternal significance of the woodpecker, the ancient Italian folk-superstition agrees: that from the tree upon which this bird nested any nail which has been driven in will soon drop out again.[691] The woodpecker owes its special significance to the circumstance that he _hammers holes into trees_. (\u201cTo drive nails in,\u201d as above!) It is, therefore, understandable that he was made much of in the Roman legend as an old king of the country, a possessor or ruler of the holy tree, the primitive image of the Paterfamilias. An old fable relates how Circe, the spouse of King Picus, transformed him into the Picus Martius, the woodpecker. The sorceress is the \u201cnew-creating mother,\u201d who has \u201cmagic influence\u201d upon the sun-husband. She kills him, transforms him into the soul-bird, the unfulfilled wish. Picus was also understood as the wood demon and incubus, as well as the soothsayer, all of which fully indicate the mother libido.[692] Picus was often placed on a par with Picumnus by the ancients. Picumnus is the inseparable companion of Pilumnus, and both are actually called _infantium dii_, \u201cthe gods of little children.\u201d Especially it was said of Pilumnus that he defended new-born children against the destroying attacks of the wood demon, Silvanus. (Good and bad mother, the motive of the two mothers.)",
