In accordance with the infantile character of this hero,\nit would most surely be time for him to take his departure from the\nstage, or, in childish language, to die. Death is to come to him in the\nform of an arrow-wound. Considering the fact that heroes themselves are\nvery often great archers or succumb to an arrow-wound (St. Sebastian, as\nan example), it may not be superfluous to inquire into the meaning of\ndeath through an arrow.\n\nWe read in the biography of the stigmatized nun Katherine Emmerich[599]\nthe following description of the evidently neurotic sickness of her\nheart:\n\n  “When only in her novitiate, she received as a Christmas present from\n  the holy Christ a very tormenting heart trouble for the whole period\n  of her nun’s life. God showed her inwardly the purpose; it was on\n  account of the decline of the spirit of the order, especially for the\n  sins of her fellow-sisters. But what rendered this trouble most\n  painful was the gift which she had possessed from youth, namely, to\n  see before her eyes the inner nature of man as he really was. She felt\n  the heart trouble physically as if her heart was continually pierced\n  by arrows.[600] These arrows—and this represented the still worse\n  mental suffering—she recognized as the thoughts, plots, secret\n  speeches, misunderstandings, scandal and uncharitableness, in which\n  her fellow-sisters, wholly without reason and unscrupulously, were\n  engaged against her and her god-fearing way of life.”\n\nIt is difficult to be a saint, because even a patient and long-suffering\nnature will not readily bear such a violation, and defends itself in its\nown way. The companion of sanctity is temptation, without which no true\nsaint can live. We know from analytic experience that these temptations\ncan pass unconsciously, so that only their equivalents would be produced\nin consciousness in the form of symptoms. We know that it is proverbial\nthat heart and smart (Herz and Schmerz) rhyme. It is a well-known fact\nthat hysterics put a physical pain in place of a mental pain. The\nbiographer of Emmerich has comprehended that very correctly. Only her\ninterpretation of the pain is, as usual, projected. It is always the\nothers who secretly assert all sorts of evil things about her, and this\nshe pretended gave her the pains.[601] The case, however, bears a\nsomewhat different aspect. The very difficult renunciation of all life’s\njoys, this death before the bloom, is generally painful, and especially\npainful are the unfulfilled wishes and the attempts of the animal nature\nto break through the power of repression. The gossip and jokes of the\nsisters very naturally centre around these most painful things, so that\nit must appear to the saint as if her symptoms were caused by this.\nNaturally, again, she could not know that gossip tends to assume the\nrôle of the unconscious, which, like a clever adversary, always aims at\nthe actual gaps in our armor.\n\nA passage from Gautama Buddha embodies this idea:[602]\n\n                  “A wish earnestly desired\n                  Produced by will, and nourished\n                  When gradually it must be thwarted,\n                  Burrows like an arrow in the flesh.”\n\nThe wounding and painful arrows do not come from without through gossip,\nwhich only attacks externally, but they come from ambush, from our own\nunconscious. This, rather than anything external, creates the\ndefenseless suffering. It is our _own repressed and unrecognized desires\nwhich fester like arrows in our flesh_.[603] In another connection this\nwas clear to the nun, and that most literally. It is a well-known fact,\nand one which needs no further proof to those who understand, that these\nmystic scenes of union with the Saviour generally are intermingled with\nan enormous amount of sexual libido.[604] Therefore, it is not\nastonishing that the scene of the stigmata is nothing but an incubation\nthrough the Saviour, only slightly changed metaphorically, as compared\nwith the ancient conception of “unio mystica,” as cohabitation with the\ngod. Emmerich relates the following of her stigmatization:\n\n  “I had a contemplation of the sufferings of Christ, and implored him\n  to let me feel with him his sorrows, and prayed five paternosters to\n  the honor of the five sacred wounds. Lying on my bed with outstretched\n  arms, I entered into a great sweetness and into an endless thirst for\n  the torments of Jesus. Then I saw a light descending upon me: it came\n  obliquely from above. It was a crucified body, living and transparent,\n  with arms extended, but without a cross. The wounds shone brighter\n  than the body; they were five circles of glory, coming forth from the\n  whole glory. I was enraptured and my heart was moved with great pain\n  and yet with sweetness from longing to share in the torments of my\n  Saviour. And my longings for the sorrows of the Redeemer increased\n  more and more on gazing on his wounds, and passed from my breast,\n  through my hands, sides and feet to his holy wounds: then from the\n  hands, then from the sides, then from the feet of the figure threefold\n  shining red beams ending below in an arrow, shot forth to my hands,\n  sides and feet.”\n\nThe beams, in accordance with the phallic fundamental thought, are\nthreefold, terminating below in an arrow-point.[605] Like Cupid, the\nsun, too, has its quiver, full of destroying or fertilizing arrows, sun\nrays,[606] which possess phallic meaning. On this significance evidently\nrests the Oriental custom of designating brave sons as arrows and\njavelins of the parents. “To make sharp arrows” is an Arabian expression\nfor “to generate brave sons.” The Psalms declare (cxxvii:4):\n\n  “Like as the arrows in the hands of the giant; even so are the young\n  children.”\n\n(Compare with this the remarks previously made about “boys.”) Because of\nthis significance of the arrow it is intelligible why the Scythian king\nAriantes, when he wished to prepare a census, demanded an arrow-head\nfrom each man. A similar meaning attaches equally to the lance. Men are\ndescended from the lance, because the ash is the mother of lances.\nTherefore, the men of the Iron Age are derived from her. The marriage\ncustom to which Ovid alludes (“Comat virgineas hasta recurva\ncomas”—_Fastorum_, lib. ii: 560) has already been mentioned. Kaineus\nissued a command that his lance be honored. Pindar relates in the legend\nof this Kaineus:\n\n  “He descended into the depths, splitting the earth with a straight\n  foot.”[607]\n\nHe is said to have originally been a maiden named Kainis, who, because\nof her complaisance, was transformed into an invulnerable man by\nPoseidon. Ovid pictures the battle of the Lapithæ with the invulnerable\nKaineus; how at last they covered him completely with trees, because\nthey could not otherwise touch him. Ovid says at this place:\n\n           “Exitus in dubio est: alii sub inania corpus\n           Tartara detrusum silvarum mole ferebant,\n           Abnuit Ampycides: medioque ex aggere fulvis\n           Vidit avem pennis liquidas exire sub auras.”[608]\n\nRoscher considers this bird to be the golden plover (Charadrius\npluvialis), which borrows its name from the fact that it lives in the\nχαράδρα, a crevice in the earth. By his song he proclaims the\napproaching rain. Kaineus was changed into this bird.\n\nWe see again in this little myth the typical constituents of the libido\nmyth: original bisexuality, immortality (invulnerability) through\nentrance into the mother (splitting the mother with the foot, and to\nbecome covered up) and resurrection as a bird of the soul and a bringer\nof fertility (ascending sun). When this type of hero causes his lance to\nbe worshipped, it probably means that his lance is a valid and\nequivalent expression of himself.\n\nFrom our present standpoint, we understand in a new sense that passage\nin Job, which I mentioned in Chapter IV of the first part of this book:\n\n  “He has set me up for his mark.\n\n  “His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and\n  doth not spare:—he poureth out my gall upon the ground.\n\n  “He breaketh me with breach upon breach: he runneth upon me like a\n  giant.”—_Job_ xvi:12–13–14.\n\nNow we understand this symbolism as an expression for the soul torment\ncaused by the onslaught of the unconscious desires. The libido festers\nin his flesh, a cruel god has taken possession of him and pierced him\nwith his painful libidian projectiles, with thoughts, which\noverwhelmingly pass through him. (As a dementia præcox patient once said\nto me during his recovery: “To-day a thought suddenly thrust itself\nthrough me.”) This same idea is found again in Nietzsche in Zarathustra:\n\n                           _The Magician_\n\n           Stretched out, shivering\n           Like one half dead whose feet are warmed,\n           Shaken alas! by unknown fevers,\n           Trembling from the icy pointed arrows of frost,\n           Hunted by Thee, O Thought!\n           Unutterable! Veiled! Horrible One!\n           Thou huntsman behind the clouds!\n           Struck to the ground by thee,\n           Thou mocking eye that gazeth at me from the dark!\n           —————— Thus do I lie\n           Bending, writhing, tortured\n           With all eternal tortures,\n           Smitten\n           By thee, crudest huntsman,\n           Thou unfamiliar God.\n\n           Smite deeper!\n           Smite once more:\n           Pierce through and rend my heart!\n           What meaneth this torturing\n           With blunt-toothed arrows?\n           Why gazeth thou again,\n           Never weary of human pain,\n           With malicious, God-lightning eyes,\n           Thou wilt not kill,\n           But torture, torture?\n\nNo long-drawn-out explanation is necessary to enable us to recognize in\nthis comparison the old, universal idea of the martyred sacrifice of\nGod, which we have met previously in the Mexican sacrifice of the cross\nand in the sacrifice of Odin.[609] This same conception faces us in the\noft-repeated martyrdom of St. Sebastian, where, in the delicate-glowing\nflesh of the young god, all the pain of renunciation which has been felt\nby the artist has been portrayed. An artist always embodies in his\nartistic work a portion of the mysteries of his time. In a heightened\ndegree the same is true of the principal Christian symbol, the crucified\none pierced by the lance, the conception of the man of the Christian era\ntormented by his wishes, crucified and dying in Christ.\n\nThis is not torment which comes from without, which befalls mankind; but\nthat he himself is the hunter, murderer, sacrificer and sacrificial\nknife is shown us in another of Nietzsche’s poems, wherein the apparent\ndualism is transformed into the soul conflict through the use of the\nsame symbolism:\n\n                 “Oh, Zarathustra,\n                 Most cruel Nimrod!\n                 Whilom hunter of God\n                 The snare of all virtue,\n                 An arrow of evil!\n                 Now\n                 Hunted by thyself\n                 Thine own prey\n                 Pierced through thyself,\n                 Now\n                 Alone with thee\n                 Twofold in thine own knowledge\n                 Mid a hundred mirrors\n                 False to thyself,\n                 Mid a hundred memories\n                 Uncertain\n                 Ailing with each wound\n                 Shivering with each frost\n                 Caught in thine own snares,\n                 Self knower!\n                 Self hangman!\n\n                 “Why didst thou strangle thyself\n                 With the noose of thy wisdom?\n                 Why hast thou enticed thyself\n                 Into the Paradise of the old serpent?\n                 Why hast thou crept\n                 Into thyself, thyself?...”\n\nThe deadly arrows do not strike the hero from without, but it is he\nhimself who, in disharmony with himself, hunts, fights and tortures\nhimself. Within himself will has turned against will, libido against\nlibido—therefore, the poet says, “Pierced through thyself,” that is to\nsay, wounded by his own arrow. Because we have discerned that the arrow\nis a libido symbol, the idea of “penetrating or piercing through”\nconsequently becomes clear to us. It is a phallic act of union with\none’s self, a sort of self-fertilization (introversion); also a\nself-violation, a self-murder; therefore, Zarathustra may call himself\nhis own hangman, like Odin, who sacrifices himself to Odin.",
