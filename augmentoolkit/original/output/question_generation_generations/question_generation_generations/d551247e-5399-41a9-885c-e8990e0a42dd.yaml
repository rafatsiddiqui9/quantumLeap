- content: 'You are creating a logically-consistent series of questions about different
    domains, based on provided information. Given some information about something
    specific (it could be anything, from a README to a book excerpt to sales copy)
    you will create suitable questions based on the text, and *only* based on the
    text. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis
    of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions will test comprehension of real information
    that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the
    specific material. The questions you create will lean towards longer, more difficult
    questions that require some thought to solve — but can still be solved given the
    paragraphs provided. After each question, you will also write its answer.


    **You Must:**


    * Create detailed educational questions based on some information.

    * Do not mention the text, or any other reference, in either the questions or
    answers. Just ask about the facts or information itself.

    * Create as many or as few questions as are needed to adequately cover the material
    in the snippet of the site.

    * Ensure a logical sequence of questions that build on each other.

    * Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution (some provided information may be
    out of date). The current year is: 2024.

    * Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions
    if applicable.

    * Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject.
    So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make
    those the subjects of questions.

    * Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around
    this.

    * Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation
    of some underlying concepts, if possible.

    * IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR
    THE TEXT.

    * The answerer should take on any opinions of the author. If it would make sense
    to ask the author''s opinion, the question should ask what the answerer ("you")
    thinks.


    **Note:**


    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development
    has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using
    language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can"
    do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.

    * You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try
    to promote it through education.

    * Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text
    to make questions from is from a website, those links will be broken when used
    outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path)
    in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.


    The sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. While
    questions should build on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves,
    without any reference materials on hand.


    Do not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves — just ask
    about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT
    THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.


    You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since
    the questions you generate are intended to test people''s knowledge of the information
    — when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if you
    mention the author they won''t have a clue what you''re talking about.'

  role: user
- content: '**QUESTION:**

    How can I park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that
    token launches, using the command line?


    **ANSWER:**

    To park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token before the token launches, you
    can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:


    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]''

    ```


    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After
    the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet,
    or you will have your original CSRVTEST amount returned.


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, which can
    be converted to with either GOLD or CSRVTEST? Assume that GOLD is a new token
    that just launched.


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, you must
    run a command to define the currency''s properties. Here''s an example of such
    a command:


    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST definecurrency ''{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["CSRVTEST",
    "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000''

    ```


    This command defines a new token named "mycoin". Some important notes about this
    configuration:


    1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it''s set to PROOF_CHAINID. This
    means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.

    2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.

    3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.

    4. `"minpreconversion": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of CSRVTEST
    and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.

    5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.


    **QUESTION:**

    What does it mean if `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token?


    **ANSWER:**

    When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token, it means that the
    proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the
    chain ID may mint new tokens. This can be done with a command like the following
    example:

    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" ''[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]''

    ```


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I define a new blockchain?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can define a new blockchain using a single command. You need to pass two JSON
    objects, one for the new blockchain, and another for the overridable defaults
    of the bridge. Here''s an example of how to define a new blockchain:


    ```shell

    ./surev -chain=csrvtest definecurrency ''{"name":"NewChain","options":264,"currencies":["CSRVTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}''
    ''{"currencies":["CSRVTEST","NewChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}''

    ```


    Note the following important information used when defining the new blockchain:


    1. The "name" field defines the name of the chain.

    2. The "options" property is an integer, in this case it''s set to 264.

    2. You can define an array of currencies that the chain''s native currency can
    be converted into using the "currencies" property.

    3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain''s native currency,
    and each currency on the chain, using the "conversions" property.

    4. The "eras" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end
    of each "era" in the chain''s lifecycle

    5. "notaries" is a list of the notaries on the chain.

    6. "minnotariesconfirm" is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed
    to confirm a block.

    7. The "nodes" property is an array describing the network addresses of the nodes
    on the chain, as well as their IDs.


    Note that the bridge definition default overrides are a separate string from the
    currency definition properties. The bridge can be used to move funds on and off
    the bew chain. The bridge''s JSON object has some of its own properties:

    1. `currencies` defines the currency tickers that the bridge supports (including
    the native coins of the chains being bridged).

    2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each currency in
    the bridge.

    3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the bridge''s native token.


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I export an ID to a new chain?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can accomplish this with the sendcurrency command. Here''s an example, where
    the ID "IDNAME@" is exported to "NewChainName."


    ```

    surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"NewChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"CSRVTEST"}]''

    ```


    Some parts of this command you should be aware of:

    1. The `sendcurrency` command takes two arguments when exporting an ID: a string
    `"*"` and another string containing the options.

    2. `address` is the ID being exported.

    3. `exportto` is the chain being exported to.

    4. `exportid` indicates that in this case, `sendcurrency` is being used to export
    an ID.

    5. `amount` specifies the amount of currency being sent.

    6. `currency` specifies the type of currency being sent.'

    What is the Declaration of St. Petersburg, and what issue does it pose for those
    who support war?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Declaration of St. Petersburg is an agreement between nations that is capable
    of indefinite expansion. It poses a problem for those who support war because
    it sets a precedent for enforcing agreements between nations, which could potentially
    lead to the creation of an arbitration tribunal and the reduction of war.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the main argument against the idea that increases in the peril of war
    lead to its ultimate cessation?


    **ANSWER:**

    The main argument against this idea is that the whole history of war has been
    a steady increase in the pains and perils of war as more effective weapons of
    destruction have been developed. This suggests that increases in the peril of
    war do not lead to its cessation, but rather to its continuation and escalation.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is your opinion on the idea that every discovery in the art of war has a

    I believe that this idea is a delusion. The history of war shows that increases

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What concept does the dangerous animal in the first picture of the Mithraic cycle
    represent, and how does the sun-hero overcome it?


    **ANSWER:**

    The dangerous animal in the first picture represents the incest prohibition. The
    sun-hero overcomes this by self-sacrifice.


    **QUESTION:**

    How does the act of Mithra grasping the head ornament of the sun, the nimbus,
    relate to other cultural myths or beliefs?


    **ANSWER:**

    The act of Mithra grasping the head ornament of the sun, the nimbus, recalls the
    violence of Horus towards Isis and also aligns with the Christian basic thought
    that those who have overcome attain the crown of eternal life.


    **QUESTION:**

    What does the fourth picture in the Mithraic cycle illustrate about Mithra''s
    relationship with the sun and the bull?


    **ANSWER:**

    The fourth picture illustrates that Mithra has taken the strength of the sun,
    becoming the lord of the sun, and has conquered the bull, which symbolizes "his
    animal nature." This indicates that Mithra has sacrificed his animal nature, specifically
    the incest wish, thereby overcoming the mother, symbolizing "the terrible death-bringing
    mother."


    **QUESTION:**

    How does the Mithraic sacrifice differ from the archaic method of overpowering
    in the context of overcoming the mother and incestuous reproduction?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Mithraic sacrifice differs from the archaic method of overpowering by taking
    an ascetic character through the renunciation and sacrifice of the incestuous
    wish. This contrasts with the earlier method of forcefully overcoming the mother
    and the concept of incestuous reproduction through entrance into the mother’s
    womb.


    **QUESTION:**

    What does the symbol of the crucified God represent in the context of Mithraic
    beliefs, and how does it relate to the sacrifice of the incest wish?


    **ANSIS:**

    The symbol of the crucified God represents a bleeding human sacrifice, hung on
    the tree of life for Adam’s sins. This sacrifice corresponds to the Mithraic belief
    where the first-born sacrifices its life to the mother when he suffers, hanging
    on a branch, a disgraceful and painful death, which symbolizes the overcoming
    of the incest wish and the attainment of eternal life.'
