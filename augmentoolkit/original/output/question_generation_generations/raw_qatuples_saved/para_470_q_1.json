    "paragraph": "Jo\u00ebl paints here, in unmistakable symbolism, the confluence of subject and object as the reunion of mother and child. The symbols agree with those of mythology, even in their details. The encircling and devouring motive is distinctly suggested. The sea, devouring the sun and giving birth to it anew, is already an old acquaintance. The moment of the rise of consciousness, the separation of subject and object is a birth; truly philosophical thought hangs with lame wings upon the few great primitive pictures of human speech, above the simple, all-surpassing greatness of which no thought can rise. The idea of the jelly fish is not \u201caccidental.\u201d Once when I was explaining to a patient the maternal significance of water at this contact with the mother complex, she experienced a very unpleasant feeling. \u201cIt makes me squirm,\u201d she said, \u201cas if I touched a jelly fish.\u201d Here, too, the same idea! The blessed state of sleep before birth and after death is, as Jo\u00ebl observed, something like old shadowy memories of that unsuspecting, thoughtless state of early childhood, where as yet no opposition disturbed the peaceful flow of dawning life, to which the inner longing always draws us back again and again, and from which the active life must free itself anew with struggle and death, so that it may not be doomed to destruction. Long before Jo\u00ebl, an Indian chieftain had said the same thing in similar words to one of the restless wise men:\u201cAh, my brother, you will never learn to know the happiness of  thinking nothing and doing nothing: this is next to sleep; this is the  most delightful thing there is. Thus we were before birth, thus we  shall be after death.\u201d[646]We shall see in Hiawatha\u2019s later fate how important his early impressions are in his choice of a wife. Hiawatha\u2019s first deed was to kill a roebuck with his arrow:",
