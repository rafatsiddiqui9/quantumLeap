It is always thought of as entirely independent, an idea current\nnot only in antiquity, but also apparent in the pornographic drawings of\nour children and artists. It is a seer, an artist and a worker of\nwonders; therefore it should not surprise us when certain phallic\ncharacteristics are found again in the mythological seer, artist and\nsorcerer. Hephaestus, Wieland the smith, and Mani, the founder of\nManicheism, whose followers were also famous, have crippled feet. The\nancient seer Melampus possessed a suggestive name (Blackfoot),[212] and\nit seems also to be typical for seers to be blind. Dwarfed stature,\nugliness and deformity have become especially typical for those\nmysterious chthonian gods, the sons of Hephaestus, the Cabiri,[213] to\nwhom great power to perform miracles was ascribed. The name signifies\n“powerful,” and the Samothracian cult is most intimately united with\nthat of the ithyphallic Hermes, who, according to the account of\nHerodotus, was brought to Attica by the Pelasgians. They are also called\nμεγάλοι θεοί, the great gods. Their near relations are the “Idaean\ndactyli” (finger or Idaean thumb),[214] to whom the mother of the gods\nhad taught the blacksmith’s art. (“The key will scent the true place\nfrom all others! follow it down!—’twill lead thee to the Mothers!”) They\nwere the first leaders, the teachers of Orpheus, and invented the\nEphesian magic formulas and the musical rhythms.[215] The characteristic\ndisparity which is shown above in the Upanishad text, and in “Faust,” is\nalso found here, since the gigantic Hercules passed as an Idaean dactyl.\n\nThe colossal Phrygians, the skilled servants of Rhea,[216] were also\nDactyli. The Babylonian teacher of wisdom, Oannes,[217] was represented\nin a phallic fish form.[218] The two sun heroes, the Dioscuri, stand in\nrelation to the Cabiri;[219] they also wear the remarkable pointed\nhead-covering (Pileus) which is peculiar to these mysterious gods,[220]\nand which is perpetuated from that time on as a secret mark of\nidentification. Attis (the elder brother of Christ) wears the pointed\ncap, just as does Mithra. It has also become traditional for our\npresent-day chthonian infantile gods,[221] the brownies (Penates), and\nall the typical kind of dwarfs. Freud[222] has already called our\nattention to the phallic meaning of the hat in modern phantasies. A\nfurther significance is that probably the pointed cap represents the\nforeskin. In order not to go too far afield from my theme, I must be\nsatisfied here merely to present the suggestion. But at a later\nopportunity I shall return to this point with detailed proof.\n\nThe dwarf form leads to the figure of the divine boy, the _puer\neternus_, the young Dionysus, Jupiter Anxurus, Tages,[223] and so on. In\nthe vase painting of Thebes, already mentioned, a bearded Dionysus is\nrepresented as ΚΑΒΕΙΡΟΣ, together with a figure of a boy as Παῖς,\nfollowed by a caricatured boy’s figure designated as ΠΡΑΤΟΛΑΟΣ and then\nagain a caricatured man, which is represented as ΜΙΤΟΣ.[224] Μίτος\nreally means thread, but in orphic speech it stands for semen. It was\nconjectured that this collection corresponded to a group of statuary in\nthe sanctuary of a cult. This supposition is supported by the history of\nthe cult as far as it is known; it is an original Phœnician cult of\nfather and son;[225] of an old and young Cabir who were more or less\nassimilated with the Grecian gods. The double figures of the adult and\nthe child Dionysus lend themselves particularly to this assimilation.\nOne might also call this the cult of the large and small man. Now, under\nvarious aspects, Dionysus is a phallic god in whose worship the phallus\nheld an important place; for example, in the cult of the Argivian\nBull—Dionysus. Moreover, the phallic herme of the god has given occasion\nfor a personification of the phallus of Dionysus, in the form of the god\nPhales, who is nothing else but a Priapus. He is called ἑταῖρος or\nσύγκωμος Βάκχου[226].[227] Corresponding to this state of affairs, one\ncannot very well fail to recognize in the previously mentioned Cabiric\nrepresentation, and in the added boy’s figure, the picture of man and\nhis penis.[228] The previously mentioned paradox in the Upanishad text\nof large and small, of giant and dwarf, is expressed more mildly here by\nman and boy, or father and son.[229] The motive of deformity which is\nused constantly by the Cabiric cult is present also in the vase picture,\nwhile the parallel figures to Dionysus and Παῖς are the caricatured\nΜίτος and Πρατόλαος. Just as formerly the difference in size gave\noccasion for division, so does the deformity here.[230]\n\nWithout first bringing further proof to bear, I may remark that from\nthis knowledge especially strong sidelights are thrown upon the original\npsychologic meaning of the religious heroes. Dionysus stands in an\nintimate relation with the psychology of the early Asiatic God who died\nand rose again from the dead and whose manifold manifestations have been\nbrought together in the figure of Christ into a firm personality\nenduring for centuries. We gain from our premise the knowledge that\nthese heroes, as well as their typical fates, are personifications of\nthe human libido and its typical fates. They are imagery, like the\nfigures of our nightly dreams—the actors and interpreters of our secret\nthoughts. And since we, in the present day, have the power to decipher\nthe symbolism of dreams and thereby surmise the mysterious psychologic\nhistory of development of the individual, so a way is here opened to the\nunderstanding of the secret springs of impulse beneath the psychologic\ndevelopment of races. Our previous trains of thought, which demonstrate\nthe phallic side of the symbolism of the libido, also show how\nthoroughly justified is the term “libido.”[231] Originally taken from\nthe sexual sphere, this word has become the most frequent technical\nexpression of psychoanalysis, for the simple reason that its\nsignificance is wide enough to cover all the unknown and countless\nmanifestations of the Will in the sense of Schopenhauer. It is\nsufficiently comprehensive and rich in meaning to characterize the real\nnature of the psychical entity which it includes. The exact classical\nsignificance of the word libido qualifies it as an entirely appropriate\nterm. Libido is taken in a very wide sense in Cicero:[232]\n\n  “(Volunt ex duobus opinatis) bonis (nasci) Libidinem et Lætitiam; ut\n  sit lætitia præsentium bonorum: libido futurorum.—Lætitia autem et\n  Libido in bonorum opinione versantur, cum Libido ad id, quod videtur\n  bonum, illecta et inflammata rapiatur.—Natura enim omnes ea, quæ bona\n  videntur, sequuntur, fugiuntque contraria. Quamobrem simul objecta\n  species cuiuspiam est, quod bonum videatur, ad id adipiscendum\n  impellit ipsa natura. Id cum constanter prudenterque fit, ejusmodi\n  appetitionem stoici βούλησιν appellant, nos appellamus voluntatem; eam\n  illi putant in solo esse sapiente, quam sic definiunt; voluntas est\n  quæ quid cum ratione desiderat: quæ autem ratione adversa incitata est\n  vehementius, ea libido est, vel cupiditas effrenata, quæ in omnibus\n  stultis invenitur.”[233]\n\nThe meaning of libido here is “to wish,” and in the stoical distinction\nof will, dissolute desire. Cicero[234] used “libido” in a corresponding\nsense:\n\n            “Agere rem aliquam libidine, non ratione.”[235]\n\nIn the same sense Sallust says:\n\n                    “Iracundia pars est libidinis.”\n\nIn another place in a milder and more general sense, which completely\napproaches the analytical use:\n\n  “Magisque in decoris armis et militaribus equis, quam in scortis et\n  conviviis libidinem habebant.”[235]\n\nAlso:\n\n             “Quod si tibi bona libido fuerit patriæ, etc.”\n\nThe use of libido is so general that the phrase “libido est scire”\nmerely had the significance of “I will, it pleases me.” In the phrase\n“aliquam libido urinæ lacessit” libido had the meaning of urgency. The\nsignificance of sexual desire is also present in the classics.\n\nThis general classical application of the conception agrees with the\ncorresponding etymological context of the word, _libido_ or _lubido_\n(with _libet_, more ancient _lubet_), it pleases me, and _libens_ or\n_lubens_ = gladly, willingly. Sanskrit, _lúbhyati_ = to experience\nviolent longing, _lôbhayati_ = excites longing, _lubdha-h_ = eager,\n_lôbha-h_ = longing, eagerness. Gothic = _liufs_, and Old High German\n_liob_ = love. Moreover, in Gothic, _lubains_ was represented as hope;\nand Old High German, _lobôn_ = to praise, _lob_ = commendation, praise,\nglory; Old Bulgarian, _ljubiti_ = to love, _ljuby_ = love; Lithuanian,\n_liáupsinti_ = to praise.[236] It can be said that the conception of\nlibido as developed in the new work of Freud and of his school has\nfunctionally the same significance in the biological territory as has\nthe conception of energy since the time of Robert Mayer in the physical\nrealm.[237] It may not be superfluous to say something more at this\npoint concerning the conception of libido after we have followed the\nformation of its symbol to its highest expression in the human form of\nthe religious hero.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER II\n            THE CONCEPTION AND THE GENETIC THEORY OF LIBIDO",
