That I love you excessively, that I have from my  desire, for I too desire that men love me excessively. That I love you  long, that I have from my everlastingness, for I am without end.\u201d[131]The religious regression makes use indeed of the parent image without, however, consciously making it an object of transference, for the incest horror[132] forbids that. It remains rather as a synonym, for example, of the father or of God, or of the more or less personified symbol of the sun and fire.[133] Sun and fire\u2014that is to say, the fructifying strength and heat\u2014are attributes of the libido. In Mysticism the inwardly perceived, divine vision is often merely sun or light, and is very little, or not at all, personified. In the Mithraic liturgy there is found, for example, a significant quotation:\u1f29 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5, \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6  \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.[134]Hildegarde von Bingen (1100\u20131178) expresses herself in the following manner:[135]\u201cBut the light I see is not local, but far off, and brighter than the  cloud which supports the sun. I can in no way know the form of this  light since I cannot entirely see the sun\u2019s disc. But within this  light I see at times, and infrequently, another light which is called  by me the living light, but when and in what manner I see this I do  not know how to say, and when I see it all weariness and need is  lifted from me, then too, I feel like a simple girl and not like an  old woman.\u201dSymeon, the New Theologian (970\u20131040), says the following:",
