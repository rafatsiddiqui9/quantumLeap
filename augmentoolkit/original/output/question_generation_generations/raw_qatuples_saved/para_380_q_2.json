    "paragraph": "We might say that the real transference taught in the Christian community is the condition absolutely necessary for the efficacy of the miracle of redemption; the first letter of John comes out frankly with this:\u201cHe that loveth his brother abideth in the light.\u201d\u2014_I John_ ii: 10.\u201cIf we love one another, God abideth in us.\u201d\u2014_I John_ iv: 12.The Deity continues to be efficacious in the Christian religion only upon the foundation of brotherly love. Consequently, here too the mystery of redemption is the unresisting real transference.[87] One may properly ask one\u2019s self, for what then is the Deity useful, if his efficacy consists only in the _real transference_? To this also the evangelical message has a striking answer:\u201cMen are all brothers in Christ.\u201d\u201cSo Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many,  shall appear a second time apart from sin to them that wait for him  unto salvation.\u201d\u2014_Heb._ ix: 28.",

    "question": "According to the text, what is the Deity's role if its efficacy is limited to \"real transference\"?",
    "answer": "The text implies that the Deity's role, if its efficacy is limited to \"real transference,\" might be questionable. The question posed is, \"To this also the evangelical message has a striking answer: 'Men are all brothers in Christ.'\" This suggests that the concept of all humanity being brothers in Christ provides a broader context for the Deity's usefulness and efficacy beyond just \"real transference.\"",
