{"paragraph": "The identification with God necessarily has as a result the enhancing of the meaning and power of the individual.[127] That seems, first of all, to have been really its purpose: a strengthening of the individual against his all too great weakness and insecurity in real life. This great megalomania thus has a genuinely pitiable background. The strengthening of the consciousness of power is, however, only an external result of the \u201cbecoming-one with God.\u201d Of much more significance are the deeper-lying disturbances in the realm of feeling. _Whoever introverts libido\u2014that is to say, whoever takes it away from a real object without putting in its place a real compensation\u2014is overtaken by the inevitable results of introversion._ The libido, which is turned inward into the subject, awakens again from among the sleeping remembrances one which contains the path upon which earlier the libido once had come to the real object. At the very first and in foremost position it was father and mother who were the objects of the childish love. They are unequalled and imperishable. Not many difficulties are needed in an adult\u2019s life to cause those memories to reawaken and to become effectual. _In religion the regressive reanimation of the father-and-mother imago is organized into a system._ The benefits of religion are the benefits of parental hands; its protection and its peace are the results of parental care upon the child; its mystic feelings are the unconscious memories of the tender emotions of the first childhood, just as the hymn expresses it:\u201cI am in my country, I come into my city. Daily am I together with my  father Atum.\u201d[128]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
