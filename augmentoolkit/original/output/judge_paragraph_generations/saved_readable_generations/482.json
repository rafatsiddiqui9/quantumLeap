{"paragraph": "The descent of the three hundred and sixty-five steps refers to the sun\u2019s course, to the cavern of death and rebirth. That this cavern actually stands in a relation to the subterranean mother of death can be shown by a note in Malalas, the historian of Antioch,[718] who relates that Diocletian consecrated there a crypt to Hecate, to which one descends by three hundred and sixty-five steps. Cave mysteries seem to have been celebrated for Hecate in Samothrace as well. The serpent also played a great part as a regular symbolic attribute in the service of Hecate. The mysteries of Hecate flourished in Rome towards the end of the fourth century, so that the two foregoing legends might indeed relate to her cult. Hecate[719] is a real spectral goddess of night and phantoms, a Mar; she is represented as riding, and in Hesiod occurs as the _patron_ of riders.

In the middle  of the coil is seen a narrow slit, polished by usage, just large  enough to allow a coin of four centimeters diameter at most to fall  through. At the side are holes for handles to lift the heavy pieces,  the under half of which is used as a cover.\u201d\u2014_Herzog_, _Ibid._, p.  212.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
