{"paragraph": "The phallus is the being, which moves without limbs, which sees without eyes, which knows the future; and as symbolic representative of the universal creative power existent everywhere immortality is vindicated in it. It is always thought of as entirely independent, an idea current not only in antiquity, but also apparent in the pornographic drawings of our children and artists. It is a seer, an artist and a worker of wonders; therefore it should not surprise us when certain phallic characteristics are found again in the mythological seer, artist and sorcerer. Hephaestus, Wieland the smith, and Mani, the founder of Manicheism, whose followers were also famous, have crippled feet. The ancient seer Melampus possessed a suggestive name (Blackfoot),[212] and it seems also to be typical for seers to be blind. Dwarfed stature, ugliness and deformity have become especially typical for those mysterious chthonian gods, the sons of Hephaestus, the Cabiri,[213] to whom great power to perform miracles was ascribed. The name signifies \u201cpowerful,\u201d and the Samothracian cult is most intimately united with that of the ithyphallic Hermes, who, according to the account of Herodotus, was brought to Attica by the Pelasgians. They are also called \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03af, the great gods. Their near relations are the \u201cIdaean dactyli\u201d (finger or Idaean thumb),[214] to whom the mother of the gods had taught the blacksmith\u2019s art. (\u201cThe key will scent the true place from all others! follow it down!\u2014\u2019twill lead thee to the Mothers!\u201d) They were the first leaders, the teachers of Orpheus, and invented the Ephesian magic formulas and the musical rhythms.[215] The characteristic disparity which is shown above in the Upanishad text, and in \u201cFaust,\u201d is also found here, since the gigantic Hercules passed as an Idaean dactyl.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
