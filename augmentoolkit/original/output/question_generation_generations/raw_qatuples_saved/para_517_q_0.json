    "paragraph": "The futility of this attitude is to be clearly seen in the failure after all these centuries to even approximate it, as evidenced in our human relations and institutions, and is quite as ineffectual in this realm as in that of sexuality where the effort to overcome this imperious domination has been attempted by lowering the instinct, and seeing in it something vile or unclean, something unspeakable and unholy. Instead of destroying the power of sexuality this struggle has only warped and distorted, injured and mutilated the expression; for not without destruction of the individual can these fundamental instincts be destroyed. Life itself has needs and imperiously demands expression through the forms created. All nature answers to this freely and simply except man. His failure to recognize himself as an instrument through which the life energy is coursing and the demands of which must be obeyed, is the cause of his misery. Despite his possession of intellect and self-consciousness, he cannot without disaster to himself refuse the tasks of life and the fulfilment of his own needs. Man\u2019s great task is the adaptation of himself to reality and the recognition of himself as an instrument for the expression of life according to his individual possibilities.It is in his privilege as a self-creator that his highest purpose is found.",

    "answer": "The text suggests that attempts to change human relations and institutions over centuries have been futile. These efforts have not significantly altered the fundamental nature of human interactions and institutions, just as they have been ineffective in addressing issues related to sexuality.",
