    "paragraph": "We owe our knowledge of the ethnologic phantasy of boring to the valuable work of Abraham,[282] who also refers us to the writings of Adalbert Kuhn.[283] Through this investigation we learn that Prometheus, the fire-bringer, may be a brother of the Hindoo Pramantha, that is to say, of the masculine fire-rubbing piece of wood. The Hindoo fire-bringer is called M\u00e2tari\u00e7van, and the activity of the fire preparation is always designated in the hieratic text by the verb \u201cmanth\u00e2mi,\u201d[284] which means _shaking_, _rubbing_, _bringing forth by rubbing_. Kuhn has put this verb in connection with the Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9, which means \u201cto learn,\u201d and has explained this conceptual relationship.[285] The \u201ctertium comparationis\u201d might lie in the rhythm, the movement to and fro in the mind. According to Kuhn, the root \u201cmanth\u201d or \u201cmath\u201d must be traced from \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 (\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1, \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) to \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf-\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 to \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2,[286] who is the Greek fire-robber. Through an unauthorized Sanskrit word \u201cpram\u00e2thyus,\u201d which comes by way of \u201cpramantha,\u201d and which possesses the double meaning of \u201cRubber\u201d and \u201cRobber,\u201d the transition to Prometheus was effected. With that, however, the prefix \u201cpra\u201d caused special difficulty, so that the whole derivation was doubted by a series of authors, and was held, in part, as erroneous. On the other hand, it was pointed out that as the Thuric Zeus bore the especially interesting cognomen \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf-\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, thus \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf-\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 might not be an original Indo-Germanic stem word that was related to the Sanskrit \u201cpramantha,\u201d but might represent only a cognomen. This interpretation is supported by a gloss of Hesychius, \u1f38\u03b8\u03ac\u03c2: \u1f41 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03be \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2.[287] Another gloss of Hesychius explains \u1f30\u03b8\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9) as \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, through which \u1f38\u03b8\u03ac\u03c2 attains the meaning of \u201cthe flaming one,\u201d analogous to \u0391\u1f34\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd or \u03a6\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2.[288] The relation of Prometheus to pramantha could scarcely be so direct as Kuhn conjectures.",
