    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ Since the dream is unconcerned with the real condition of things, it brings\
    \ the most heterogeneous matter together, and a world of impossibilities takes\
    \ the place of realities. Freud finds progression characteristic of thinking when\
    \ awake; that is to say, the advancement of the thought excitation from the system\
    \ of the inner or outer perception through the “endopsychic” work of association,\
    \ conscious and unconscious, to the motor end; that is to say, towards innervation.\
    \ In the dream he finds the reverse, namely, regression of the thought excitation\
    \ from the preconscious or unconscious to the system of perception, by the means\
    \ of which the dream receives its ordinary impression of sensuous distinctness,\
    \ which can rise to an almost hallucinating clearness. The dream thinking moves\
    \ in a retrograde manner towards the raw material of memory. “The structure of\
    \ the dream thoughts is dissolved during the progress of regression into its raw\
    \ material.” The reanimation of the original perception is, however, only one\
    \ side of regression. The other side is regression to the infantile memory material,\
    \ which might also be understood as regression to the original perception, but\
    \ which deserves especial mention on account of its independent importance. This\
    \ regression might, indeed, be considered as “historical.” The dream, according\
    \ to this conception, might also be described as _the substitute of the infantile\
    \ scene, changed through transference into the recent scene_.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion\
