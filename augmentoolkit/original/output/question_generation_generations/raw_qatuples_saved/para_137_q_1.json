    "paragraph": "\u201cWhat was hidden in the shell,     Was born through the power of fiery torments.     From this first arose love,     As the germ of knowledge,     The wise found the roots of existence in non-existence,     By investigating the hearts impulses.\u201d[768]This philosophical view interprets the world as an emanation of the libido, and this must be widely accepted from the theoretic as well as the psychologic standpoint, for the function of reality is an instinctive function, having the character of biological adaptation. When the insane Schreber brought about the end of the world through his libido-introversion, he expressed an entirely rational psychologic view, just as Schopenhauer wished to abolish through negation (holiness, asceticism) the error of the primal will, through which the world was created. Does not Goethe say:\u201cYou follow a false trail;         Do not think that we are not serious;         Is not the kernel of nature         In the hearts of men?\u201dThe hero, who is to accomplish the rejuvenation of the world and the conquest of death, is the libido, which, brooding upon itself in introversion, coiling as a snake around its own egg, apparently threatens life with a poisonous bite, in order to lead it to death, and from that darkness, conquering itself, gives birth to itself again. Nietzsche knows this conception:[769]\u201cHow long have you sat already upon your misfortune.      Give heed! lest you hatch an egg,      A basilisk egg      Of your long travail.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the text connect the concept of libido to the idea of creation and the end of the world?",
    "answer": "The text connects the concept of libido to the idea of creation and the end of the world by describing how the psyche\u2019s introspective and introverted process of the libido can lead to both the creation of the world and its potential destruction. It uses the example of Schreber and Schopenhauer to illustrate how this introspective process can be rational and aimed at negating or reforming the primal will.",
