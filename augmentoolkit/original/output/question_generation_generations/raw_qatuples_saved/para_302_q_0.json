    "paragraph": "\u201cWhen only in her novitiate, she received as a Christmas present from  the holy Christ a very tormenting heart trouble for the whole period  of her nun\u2019s life. God showed her inwardly the purpose; it was on  account of the decline of the spirit of the order, especially for the  sins of her fellow-sisters. But what rendered this trouble most  painful was the gift which she had possessed from youth, namely, to  see before her eyes the inner nature of man as he really was. She felt  the heart trouble physically as if her heart was continually pierced  by arrows.[600] These arrows\u2014and this represented the still worse  mental suffering\u2014she recognized as the thoughts, plots, secret  speeches, misunderstandings, scandal and uncharitableness, in which  her fellow-sisters, wholly without reason and unscrupulously, were  engaged against her and her god-fearing way of life.\u201d",
