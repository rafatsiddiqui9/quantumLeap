    "paragraph": "The neurotic who cannot leave the mother has good reasons; the fear of death holds him there. It seems as if no idea and no word were strong enough to express the meaning of this. Entire religions were constructed in order to give words to the immensity of this conflict. This struggle for expression which continued down through the centuries certainly cannot have its source in the restricted realm of the vulgar conception of incest. Rather one must understand the law which is ultimately expressed as \u201cIncest prohibition\u201d as coercion to domestication, and consider the religious systems as institutions which first receive, then organize and gradually sublimate, the motor forces of the animal nature not immediately available for cultural purposes.",

    "question": "Why do you think entire religions were constructed to address the concept of incest prohibition?",
    "answer": "Entire religions were constructed to address the concept of incest prohibition because they serve to give words and form to the deep, fundamental conflict and struggle for expression that this prohibition represents. This struggle has persisted through centuries and is not rooted in a simple understanding of incest but is rather a broader coercion towards domestication and cultural norms.",
