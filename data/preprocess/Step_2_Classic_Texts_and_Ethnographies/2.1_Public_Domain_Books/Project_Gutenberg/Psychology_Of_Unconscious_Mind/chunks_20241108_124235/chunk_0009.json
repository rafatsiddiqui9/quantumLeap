  "original_text": "These arguments of Baldwin abundantly emphasize the wide-reaching\nlimitations of thinking caused by language.[25] These limitations are of\nthe greatest significance, both subjectively and objectively; at least\ntheir meaning is great enough to force one to ask one’s self if, after\nall, in regard to independence of thought, Franz Mauthner, thoroughly\nsceptical, is not really correct in his view that thinking is speech and\nnothing more. Baldwin expresses himself more cautiously and reservedly;\nnevertheless, his inner meaning is plainly in favor of the primacy of\nspeech (naturally not in the sense of the spoken word); the directed\nthinking, or as we might perhaps call it, the thinking in internal\nspeech, is the manifest instrument of culture, and we do not go astray\nwhen we say that the powerful work of education which the centuries have\ngiven to directed thinking has produced, just through the peculiar\ndevelopment of thinking from the individual subjective into the social\nobjective, a practical application of the human mind to which we owe\nmodern empiricism and technic, and which occurs for absolutely the first\ntime in the history of the world. Inquisitive minds have often tormented\nthemselves with the question why the undoubtedly extraordinary knowledge\nof mathematics and principles and material facts united with the\nunexampled art of the human hand in antiquity never arrived at the point\nof developing those known technical statements of fact, for instance,\nthe principles of simple machines, beyond the realm of the amusing and\ncurious to a real technic in the modern sense. There is necessarily only\none answer to this; the ancients almost entirely, with the exception of\na few extraordinary minds, lacked the capacity to allow their interest\nto follow the transformations of inanimate matter to the extent\nnecessary for them to be able to reproduce the process of nature,\ncreatively and through their own art, by means of which alone they could\nhave succeeded in putting themselves in possession of the force of\nnature. That which they lacked was training in directed thinking, or, to\nexpress it psychoanalytically, the ancients did not succeed in tearing\nloose the libido which might be sublimated, from the other natural\nrelations, and did not turn voluntarily to anthropomorphism. The secret\nof the development of culture lies in the _mobility of the libido_, and\nin its capacity for transference. It is, therefore, to be assumed that\nthe directed thinking of our time is a more or less modern acquisition,\nwhich was lacking in earlier times.\n\nBut with that we come to a further question, viz., what happens if we do\nnot think directedly? Then our thinking lacks the major idea, and the\nfeeling of direction which emanates from that.[26] We no longer compel\nour thoughts along a definite track, but let them float, sink and mount\naccording to their own gravity. According to Kulpe[27] thinking is a\nkind of inner will action, the absence of which necessarily leads to an\nautomatic play of ideas. James understands the non-directed thinking, or\n“merely associative” thinking, as the ordinary one. He expresses himself\nabout that in the following manner:\n\n  “Our thought consists for the great part of a series of images, one of\n  which produces the other; _a sort of passive dream-state of which the\n  higher animals are also capable_. This sort of thinking leads,\n  nevertheless, to reasonable conclusions of a practical as well as of a\n  theoretical nature.\n\n  “As a rule, the links of this sort of irresponsible thinking, which\n  are accidentally bound together, are empirically concrete things, not\n  abstractions.”\n\nWe can, in the following manner, complete these definitions of William\nJames. This sort of thinking does not tire us; it quickly leads us away\nfrom reality into phantasies of the past and future. Here, thinking in\nthe form of speech ceases, image crowds upon image, feeling upon\nfeeling; more and more clearly one sees a tendency which creates and\nmakes believe, not as it truly is, but as one indeed might wish it to\nbe.[28] The material of these thoughts which turns away from reality,\ncan naturally be only the past with its thousand memory pictures. The\ncustomary speech calls this kind of thinking “dreaming.”\n\nWhoever attentively observes himself will find the general custom of\nspeech very striking, for almost every day we can see for ourselves how,\nwhen falling asleep, phantasies are woven into our dreams, so that\nbetween the dreams of day and night there is not so great a difference.\nThus we have two forms of thinking—_directed thinking_ and _dream or\nphantasy thinking_. The first, working for communication with speech\nelements, is troublesome and exhausting; the latter, on the contrary,\ngoes on without trouble, working spontaneously, so to speak, with\nreminiscences. The first creates innovations, adaptations, imitates\nreality and seeks to act upon it. The latter, on the contrary, turns\naway from reality, sets free subjective wishes, and is, in regard to\nadaptation, wholly unproductive.[29]\n\nLet us leave aside the query as to why we possess these two different\nways of thinking, and turn back to the second proposition, namely, how\ncomes it that we have two different ways of thinking? I have intimated\nabove that history shows us that directed thinking was not always as\ndeveloped as it is at present. In this age the most beautiful expression\nof directed thinking is science, and the technic fostered by it. Both\nthings are indebted for their existence simply to an energetic education\nin directed thinking. At the time, however, when a few forerunners of\nthe present culture, like the poet Petrarch, first began to appreciate\nNature understandingly[30] there was already in existence an equivalent\nfor our science, to wit, scholasticism.[31] This took its objects from\nthe phantasies of the past, and it gave to the mind a dialectic training\nin directed thinking. The only success which beckoned the thinker was\nrhetorical victory in disputation, and not a visible transformation of\nreality.\n\nThe subjects of thinking were often astonishingly phantastical; for\nexample, questions were discussed, such as how many angels could have a\nplace on the point of a needle? Whether Christ could have done his work\nof redemption equally well if he had come into the world as a pea? The\npossibility of such problems, to which belong the metaphysical problems\nin general, viz., to be able to know the unknowable, shows us of what\npeculiar kind that mind must have been which created such things which\nto us are the height of absurdity. Nietzsche had guessed, however, at\nthe biological background of this phenomenon when he spoke of the\n“beautiful tension” of the Germanic mind which the Middle Ages created.\nTaken historically, scholasticism, in the spirit of which persons of\ntowering intellectual powers, such as Thomas of Aquinas, Duns Scotus,\nAbélard, William of Occam and others, have labored, is the mother of the\nmodern scientific attitude, and a later time will see clearly how and in\nwhat scholasticism still furnishes living undercurrents to the science\nof to-day. Its whole nature lies in dialectic gymnastics which have\nraised the symbol of speech, the word, to an almost absolute meaning, so\nthat it finally attained to that substantiality which expiring antiquity\ncould lend to its _logos_ only temporarily, through attributes of\nmystical valuation. The great work of scholasticism, however, appears to\nbe the foundation of firmly knitted intellectual sublimation, the\n_conditio sine qua non_ of the modern scientific and technical spirit.\n\nShould we go further back into history, we shall find that which to-day\nwe call science, dissolved into an indistinct cloud. The modern\nculture-creating mind is incessantly occupied in stripping off all\nsubjectivity from experience, and in finding those formulas which bring\nNature and her forces to the best and most fitting expression. It would\nbe an absurd and entirely unjustified self-glorification if we were to\nassume that we are more energetic or more intelligent than the\nancients—our materials for knowledge have increased, but not our\nintellectual capacity. For this reason, we become immediately as\nobstinate and insusceptible in regard to new ideas as people in the\ndarkest times of antiquity. Our knowledge has increased but not our\nwisdom. The main point of our interest is displaced wholly into material\nreality; antiquity preferred a mode of thought which was more closely\nrelated to a phantastic type. Except for a sensitive perspicuity towards\nworks of art, not attained since then, we seek in vain in antiquity for\nthat precise and concrete manner of thinking characteristic of modern\nscience. We see the antique spirit create not science but mythology.\nUnfortunately, we acquire in school only a very paltry conception of the\nrichness and immense power of life of Grecian mythology.\n\nTherefore, at first glance, it does not seem possible for us to assume\nthat that energy and interest which to-day we put into science and\ntechnic, the man of antiquity gave in great part to his mythology. That,\nnevertheless, gives the explanation for the bewildering changes, the\nkaleidoscopic transformations and new syncretistic groupings, and the\ncontinued rejuvenation of the myths in the Grecian sphere of culture.\nHere, we move in a world of phantasies, which, little concerned with the\nouter course of things, flows from an inner source, and, constantly\nchanging, creates now plastic, now shadowy shapes. This phantastical\nactivity of the ancient mind created artistically _par excellence_. The\nobject of the interest does not seem to have been to grasp hold of the\n“how” of the real world as objectively and exactly as possibly, but to\næsthetically adapt subjective phantasies and expectations. There was\nvery little place among ancient people for the coldness and disillusion\nwhich Giordano Bruno’s thoughts on eternity and Kepler’s discoveries\nbrought to modern humanity. The naïve man of antiquity saw in the sun\nthe great Father of the heaven and the earth, and in the moon the\nfruitful good Mother. Everything had its demons; they animated equally a\nhuman being and his brother, the animal. Everything was considered\naccording to its anthropomorphic or theriomorphic attributes, as human\nbeing or animal. Even the disc of the sun was given wings or four feet,\nin order to illustrate its movement. Thus arose an idea of the universe\nwhich was not only very far from reality, but was one which corresponded\nwholly to subjective phantasies.\n\nWe know, from our own experience, this state of mind. It is an infantile\nstage. To a child the moon is a man or a face or a shepherd of the\nstars. The clouds in the sky seem like little sheep; the dolls drink,\neat and sleep; the child places a letter at the window for the\nChrist-child; he calls to the stork to bring him a little brother or\nsister; the cow is the wife of the horse, and the dog the husband of the\ncat. We know, too, that lower races, like the negroes, look upon the\nlocomotive as an animal, and call the drawers of the table the child of\nthe table.\n\nAs we learn through Freud, the dream shows a similar type. Since the\ndream is unconcerned with the real condition of things, it brings the\nmost heterogeneous matter together, and a world of impossibilities takes\nthe place of realities. Freud finds progression characteristic of\nthinking when awake; that is to say, the advancement of the thought\nexcitation from the system of the inner or outer perception through the\n“endopsychic” work of association, conscious and unconscious, to the\nmotor end; that is to say, towards innervation. In the dream he finds\nthe reverse, namely, regression of the thought excitation from the\npreconscious or unconscious to the system of perception, by the means of\nwhich the dream receives its ordinary impression of sensuous\ndistinctness, which can rise to an almost hallucinating clearness. The\ndream thinking moves in a retrograde manner towards the raw material of\nmemory. “The structure of the dream thoughts is dissolved during the\nprogress of regression into its raw material.” The reanimation of the\noriginal perception is, however, only one side of regression. The other\nside is regression to the infantile memory material, which might also be\nunderstood as regression to the original perception, but which deserves\nespecial mention on account of its independent importance. This\nregression might, indeed, be considered as “historical.” The dream,\naccording to this conception, might also be described as _the substitute\nof the infantile scene, changed through transference into the recent\nscene_.\n\nThe infantile scene cannot carry through its revival; it must be\nsatisfied with its return as a dream. From this conception of the\nhistorical side of regression, it follows consequently that the modes of\nconclusion of the dream, in so far as one may speak of them, must show\nat the same time an analogous and infantile character. This is truly the\ncase, as experience has abundantly shown, so that to-day every one who\nis familiar with the subject of dream analysis confirms Freud’s\nproposition that _dreams are a piece of the conquered life of the\nchildish soul_. Inasmuch as the childish psychic life is undeniably of\nan archaic type, this characteristic belongs to the dream in quite an\nunusual degree. Freud calls our attention to this especially.",
