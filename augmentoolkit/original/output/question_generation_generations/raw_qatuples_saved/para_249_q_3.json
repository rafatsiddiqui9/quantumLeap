    "paragraph": "Pegasus with his foot strikes out of the earth the spring Hippocrene. Upon a Corinthian statue of Bellerophon, which was also a fountain, the water flowed out from the horse\u2019s hoof. Balder\u2019s horse gave rise to a spring through his kick. Thus the horse\u2019s foot is the dispenser of fruitful moisture.[585] A legend of lower Austria, told by Jaehns, informs us that a gigantic man on a white horse is sometimes seen riding over the mountains. This means a speedy rain. In the German legend the goddess of birth, Frau Holle, appears on horseback. Pregnant women near confinement are prone to give oats to a white horse from their aprons and to pray him to give them a speedy delivery. It was originally the custom for the horse to rub against the woman\u2019s genitals. The horse (like the ass) had in general the significance of a priapic animal.[586] Horse\u2019s tracks are idols dispensing blessing and fertility. Horse\u2019s tracks established a claim, and were of significance in determining boundaries, like the priaps of Latin antiquity. Like the phallic Dactyli, a horse opened the mineral riches of the Harz Mountains with his hoof. The horseshoe, an equivalent for horse\u2019s foot,[587] brings luck and has apotropaic meaning. In the Netherlands an entire horse\u2019s foot is hung up in the stable to ward against sorcery. The analogous effect of the phallus is well known; hence the phalli at the gates. In particular the horse\u2019s leg turned lightning aside, according to the principle \u201csimilia similibus.\u201dHorses also symbolize the wind, that is to say, the tertium comparationis is again the libido symbol. The German legend recognizes the wind as the wild huntsman in pursuit of the maiden. Stormy regions frequently derive their names from horses, as the White Horse Mountain of the L\u00fcneburger heath. The centaurs are typical wind gods, and have been represented as such by B\u00f6cklin\u2019s artistic intuition.[588]",
