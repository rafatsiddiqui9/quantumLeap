    "paragraph": "No one dealing with analytic psychology can fail to be struck by the tremendous and unnecessary burdens which man has placed upon himself, and how greatly he has increased the difficulties of adaptation by his rigid intellectual views and moral formulas, and by his inability to admit to himself that he is actually just a human being imperfect, and containing within himself all manner of tendencies, good and bad, all striving for some satisfactory goal. Further, that the refusal to see himself in this light instead of as an ideal person in no way alters the actual condition, and that in fact, through the cheap pretense of being able only to consider himself as a very virtuous person, or as shocked and hurt when observing the \u201csins\u201d of others, he actually is prevented from developing his own character and bringing his own capacities to their fullest expressions.There is frequently expressed among people the idea of how fortunate it is that we cannot see each other\u2019s thoughts, and how disturbing it would be if our real feelings could be read. But what is so shameful in these secrets of the soul? They are in reality our own egoistic desires all striving, longing, wishing for satisfaction, for happiness; those desires which instinctively crave their own gratification but which can only be really fulfilled by adapting them to the real world and to the social group.Why is it that it is so painful for man to admit that the prime influence in all human endeavor is found in the ego itself, in its desires, wishes, needs and satisfactions, in short, in its need for self-expression and self-perpetuation, the evolutionary impetus in life?",

    "question": "Why does the author find it painful for man to admit that the prime influence in all human endeavor is found in the ego itself?",
    "answer": "The author finds it painful for man to admit that the prime influence in all human endeavor is found in the ego because it exposes the instinctive desires, wishes, needs, and the need for self-expression and self-perpetuation. This acknowledgment is seen as a direct challenge to the social and moral constructs that man often holds onto, which can make it difficult to accept the evolutionary impetus in life.",
