    "paragraph": "By means of the secular practice of the na\u00efve projection which is, as we have seen, nothing else than a veiled or indirect real-transference (through the spiritual, through the logos), Christian training has produced a widespread weakening of the animal nature so that a great part of the strength of the impulses could be set free for the work of social preservation and fruitfulness.[100] This abundance of libido, to make use of this singular expression, pursues with a budding renaissance (for example Petrarch) a course which outgoing antiquity had already sketched out as religious; viz., the way of the transference to nature.[101] The transformation of this libidinous interest is in great part due to the Mithraic worship, which was a nature religion in the best sense of the word;[102] while the primitive Christians exhibited throughout an antagonistic attitude to the beauties of this world.[103] I remember the passage of St. Augustine mentioned by J.

Christian training has led to a widespread weakening of the animal nature, allowing a significant portion of the impulses to be directed towards social preservation and fruitfulness. This process has resulted in an abundance of libido, which has led to a renaissance, as seen in figures like Petrarch, where this libidinous interest is transferred to nature.",
