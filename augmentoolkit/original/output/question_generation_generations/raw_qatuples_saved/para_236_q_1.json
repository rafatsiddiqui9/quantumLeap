    "paragraph": "The discovery of fire seems to be due to a very similar regression to the presexual stage, more particularly to the nearest stage of the displaced rhythmic manifestation. The libido, introverted from the incest prohibition (with the more detailed designation of the motor components of coitus), when it reaches the presexual stage, meets the related infantile boring, to which it now gives, in accordance with its realistic destination, an actual material. (Therefore the material is fittingly called \u201cmateria,\u201d as the object is the mother as above.) As I sought to show above, the action of the infantile boring requires only the strength and perseverance of an adult man and suitable \u201cmaterial\u201d in order to generate fire. If this is so, it may be expected that analogous to our foregoing case of onanistic boring the generation of fire originally occurred as such an act of quasi-onanistic activity, objectively expressed. The demonstration of this can never be actually furnished, but it is thinkable that somewhere traces of this original onanistic preliminary exercise of fire production have been preserved. I have succeeded in finding a passage in a very old monument of Hindoo literature which contains this transition of the sexual libido through the onanistic phase in the preparation of fire. This passage is found in Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad:[309]",

    "question": "What is the significance of the \"materia\" in the context of fire discovery?",
    "answer": "The \"materia\" is significant because it represents the actual material that the libido, when introverted and in the presexual stage, provides to the infantile boring action. This material is essential for generating fire, and it is called \"materia\" because it serves as the object, analogous to the mother.",
