    "paragraph": "(30) \u201cNevertheless, what sayeth the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman  and her son; for the son of a bondwoman shall not be heir with the son  of a freewoman.(31) \u201cSo, then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of  the free.\u201dChapter v:(1) \u201cStand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us  free.\u201dThe Christians are the children of the City Above, a symbol of the mother, not sons of the earthly city-mother, who is to be cast out; for those born after the flesh are opposed to those born after the spirit, who are not born from the mother in the flesh, but from a symbol for the mother. One must again think of the Indians at this point, who say the first people proceeded from the sword-hilt and a shuttle. The religious thought is bound up with the compulsion to call the mother no longer mother, but City, Source, Sea, etc. This compulsion can be derived from the need to manifest an amount of libido bound up with the mother, but in such a way that the mother is represented by or concealed in a symbol. The symbolism of the city we find well-developed in the revelations of John, where two cities play a great part, one of which is insulted and cursed by him, the other greatly desired. We read in Revelation (xvii:1):(1) \u201cCome hither: I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great  whore that sitteth on many waters.(2) \u201cWith whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and  the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her  fornication.(3) \u201cSo he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I  saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of the names of  blasphemy, and having seven heads and ten horns.",

    "question": "How does the text explain the distinction between \"sons of the bondwoman\" and \"sons of the free woman\"?",
    "answer": "The text explains that \"sons of the bondwoman\" are opposed to \"sons of the free woman.\" Those born \"after the flesh\" (bondwoman) are contrasted with those born \"after the spirit\" (free woman), who are symbolically born from a higher, spiritual concept represented by a city or other symbols rather than a physical mother.",
