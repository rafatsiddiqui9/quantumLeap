- content: 'Text: """The double significance of the tree is readily explained by the
    fact that such symbols are not to be understood “anatomically” but psychologically
    as libido symbols; therefore, it is not permissible to interpret the tree on account
    of its similar form as directly phallic; it can also be called a woman or the
    uterus of the mother. The uniformity of the significance lies alone in the similarity
    to the libido.[451] One loses one’s way in one “cul de sac” after another by saying
    that this is the symbol substituted for the mother and that for the penis. In
    this realm there is no fixed significance of things. The only reality here is
    the libido, for which “all that is perishable is merely a symbol.” It is not the
    physical actual mother, but the libido of the son, the object of which was once
    the mother. We take mythologic symbols much too concretely and wonder at every
    step about the endless contradictions. These contradictions arise only because
    we constantly forget that in the realm of phantasy “feeling is all.” Whenever
    we read, therefore, “his mother was a wicked sorcerer,” the translation is as
    follows: The son is in love with her, namely, he is unable to detach his libido
    from the mother-imago; he therefore suffers from incestuous resistance.The symbolism
    of water and trees, which are met with as further attributes in the symbol of
    the City, also refer to that amount of libido which unconsciously is fastened
    to the mother-imago. In certain parts of Revelation the unconscious psychology
    of religious longing is revealed, namely, the longing for the _mother_.[452] The
    expectation of Revelation ends in the mother: καὶ πᾶν κατάθεμα οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι (“and

    disharmony with one’s self, no guilt, no fear of death and no pain of separation
