Nature seems suddenly to have assumed a\nvery strange significance. This phenomenon can be explained only through\nthe fact that a great amount of libido was stored up and now is given to\nnature. As is well known, men of even dull and prosy minds, in the\nspringtime of love, suddenly become aware of nature, and even make poems\nabout it. But we know that libido, prevented from an actual way of\ntransference, always reverts to an earlier way of transference.\nMinnehaha, the laughing water, is so clearly an allusion to the mother\nthat the secret yearning of the hero for the mother is powerfully\ntouched. Therefore, without having undertaken anything, he goes home to\nNokomis; but there again he is driven away, because Minnehaha already\nstands in his path.\n\nHe turns, therefore, even further away, into that early youthful period,\nthe tones of which recall Minnehaha most forcibly to his thoughts, where\nhe learnt to hear the mother-sounds in the sounds of nature. In this\nvery strange revival of the impressions of nature we recognize a\nregression to those earliest and strongest nature impressions which\nstand next to the subsequently extinguished, even stronger, impressions\nwhich the child received from the mother. The glamour of this feeling\nfor her is transferred to other objects of the childish environment\n(father’s house, playthings, etc.), from which later those magic\nblissful feelings proceed, which seem to be peculiar to the earliest\nchildish memories. When, therefore, Hiawatha hides himself in the lap of\nnature, it is really the mother’s womb, and it is to be expected that he\nwill emerge again new-born in some form.\n\nBefore turning to this new creation arising from introversion, there is\nstill a further significance of the preceding question to be considered:\nwhether life is dependent upon “these things”? Life may depend upon\nthese things in the degree that they serve _for nourishment_. We must\ninfer in this case that suddenly the question of nutrition came very\nnear the hero’s heart. (This possibility will be thoroughly proven in\nwhat follows.) The question of nutrition, indeed, enters seriously into\nconsideration. First, because regression to the mother necessarily\nrevives that special path of transference; namely, that of nutrition\nthrough the mother. As soon as the libido regresses to the presexual\nstage, there we may expect to see the function of nutrition and its\nsymbols put in place of the sexual function. Thence is derived an\nessential root of the displacement from below upwards (Freud), because,\nin the presexual stage, the principal value belongs not to the genitals,\nbut to the mouth. Secondly, because the hero fasted, his hunger becomes\npredominant. Fasting, as is well known, is employed to silence\nsexuality; also, it expresses symbolically the resistance against\nsexuality, translated into the language of the presexual stage. On the\nfourth day of his fast the hero ceased to address himself to nature; he\nlay exhausted, with half-closed eyes, upon his couch, sunk deep in\ndreams, the picture of extreme introversion.\n\nWe have already seen that, in such circumstances, an infantile internal\nequivalent for reality appears, in the place of external life and\nreality. This is also the case with Hiawatha:\n\n                “And he saw a youth approaching,\n                Dressed in garments green and yellow,\n                Coming through the purple twilight,\n                Through the splendor of the sunset;\n                Plumes of green bent o’er his forehead,\n                And his hair was soft and golden.”\n\nThis remarkable apparition reveals himself in the following manner to\nHiawatha:\n\n                “From the Master of Life descending,\n                I, the friend of man, Mondamin,\n                Come to warn you and instruct you,\n                How by struggle and by labor\n                You shall gain what you have prayed for.\n                Rise up from your bed of branches;\n                Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!”\n\nMondamin is the maize: a god, who is eaten, arising from Hiawatha’s\nintroversion. His hunger, taken in a double sense, his longing for the\nnourishing mother, gives birth from his soul to another hero, the edible\nmaize, the son of the earth mother. Therefore, he again arises at\nsunset, symbolizing the entrance into the mother, and in the western\nsunset glow he begins again the mystic struggle with the self-created\ngod, the god who has originated entirely from the longing for the\nnourishing mother. The struggle is again the struggle for liberation\nfrom this destructive and yet productive longing. Mondamin is,\ntherefore, equivalent to the mother, and the struggle with him means the\noverpowering and impregnation of the mother. This interpretation is\nentirely proven by a myth of the Cherokees, “who invoke it (the maize)\nunder the name of ‘The Old Woman,’ in allusion to a myth that it sprang\nfrom the blood of an old woman killed by her disobedient sons”:[654]\n\n                  “Faint with famine, Hiawatha\n                  Started from his bed of branches,\n                  From the twilight of his wigwam\n                  Forth into the flush of sunset\n                  Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;\n                  At his touch he felt new courage\n                  Throbbing in his brain and bosom,\n                  Felt new life and hope and vigor\n                  Run through every nerve and fibre.”\n\nThe battle at sunset with the god of the maize gives Hiawatha new\nstrength; and thus it must be, because the fight for the individual\ndepths, against the paralyzing longing for the mother, gives creative\nstrength to men. Here, indeed, is the source of all creation, but it\ndemands heroic courage to fight against these forces and to wrest from\nthem the “treasure difficult to attain.” He who succeeds in this has, in\ntruth, attained the best. Hiawatha wrestles with himself for his\ncreation.[655] The struggle lasts again the charmed three days. The\nfourth day, just as Mondamin prophesied, Hiawatha conquers him, and\nMondamin sinks to the ground in death. As Mondamin previously desired,\nHiawatha digs his grave in mother earth, and soon afterwards from this\ngrave the young and fresh maize grows for the nourishment of mankind.\n\nConcerning the thought of this fragment, we have therein a beautiful\nparallel to the mystery of Mithra, where first the battle of the hero\nwith his bull occurs. Afterwards Mithra carries in “transitus” the bull\ninto the cave, where he kills him. From this death all fertility grows,\nall that is edible.[656] The cave corresponds to the grave. The same\nidea is represented in the Christian mysteries, although generally in\nmore beautiful human forms. The soul struggle of Christ in Gethsemane,\nwhere he struggles with himself in order to complete his work, then the\n“transitus,” the carrying of the cross,[657] where he takes upon himself\nthe symbol of the destructive mother, and therewith takes himself to the\nsacrificial grave, from which, after three days, he triumphantly arises;\nall these ideas express the same fundamental thoughts. Also, the symbol\nof eating is not lacking in the Christian mystery. Christ is a god who\nis eaten in the Lord’s Supper. His death transforms him into bread and\nwine, which we partake of in grateful memory of his great deed.[658] The\nrelation of Agni to the Somadrink and that of Dionysus to wine[659] must\nnot be omitted here. An evident parallel is Samson’s rending of the\nlion, and the subsequent inhabitation of the dead lion by honey bees,\nwhich gives rise to the well-known German riddle:\n\n  “Speise ging von dem Fresser und Süssigkeit von dem Starken (Food went\n  from the glutton and sweet from the strong).”[660]\n\nIn the Eleusinian mysteries these thoughts seem to have played a rôle.\nBesides Demeter and Persephone, Iakchos is a chief god of the Eleusinian\ncult; he was the “puer æternus,” the eternal boy, of whom Ovid says the\nfollowing:\n\n            “Tu puer æternus, tu formosissimus alto\n            Conspiceris cœlo tibi, cum sine cornibus astas,\n            Virgineum caput est,” etc.[661]\n\nIn the great Eleusinian festival procession the image of Iakchos was\ncarried. It is not easy to say which god is Iakchos, possibly a boy, or\na new-born son, similar to the Etrurian Tages, who bears the surname\n“the freshly ploughed boy,” because, according to the myth, he arose\nfrom the furrow of the field behind the peasant, who was ploughing. This\nidea shows unmistakably the Mondamin motive. The plough is of well-known\nphallic meaning; the furrow of the field is personified by the Hindoos\nas woman. The psychology of this idea is that of a coitus, referred back\nto the presexual stage (stage of nutrition). The son is the edible fruit\nof the field. Iakchos passes, in part, as son of Demeter or of\nPersephone, also appropriately as consort of Demeter. (Hero as\nprocreator of himself.) He is also called τῆς Δήμητρος δαίμων (Δαίμων\nequals libido, also Mother libido.) He was identified with Dionysus,\nespecially with the Thracian Dionysus-Zagreus, of whom a typical fate of\nrebirth was related. Hera had goaded the Titans against Zagreus, who,\nassuming many forms, sought to escape them, until they finally took him\nwhen he had taken on the form of a bull. In this form he was killed\n(Mithra sacrifice) and dismembered, and the pieces were thrown into a\ncauldron; but Zeus killed the Titans by lightning, and swallowed the\nstill-throbbing heart of Zagreus. Through this act he gave him existence\nonce more, and Zagreus as Iakchos again came forth.\n\nIakchos carries the torch, the phallic symbol of procreation, as Plato\ntestifies. In the festival procession, the sheaf of corn, the cradle of\nIakchos, was carried. (λῖκνον, mystica vannus Iacchi.) The Orphic\nlegend[662] relates that Iakchos was brought up by Persephone, when,\nafter three years’ slumber in the λῖκνον,[663] he awoke. This statement\ndistinctly suggests the Mondamin motive. The 20th of Boedromion (the\nmonth Boedromion lasts from about the 5th of September to the 5th of\nOctober) is called Iakchos, in honor of the hero. On the evening of this\nday the great torchlight procession took place on the seashore, in which\nthe quest and lament of Demeter was represented. The rôle of Demeter,\nwho, seeking her daughter, wanders over the whole earth without food or\ndrink, has been taken over by Hiawatha in the Indian epic. He turns to\nall created things without obtaining an answer. As Demeter first learns\nof her daughter from the subterranean Hecate, so does Hiawatha first\nfind the one sought for, Mondamin,[664] in the deepest introversion\n(descent to the mother). Hiawatha produces from himself, Mondamin, as a\nmother produces the son. The longing for the mother also includes the\nproducing mother (first devouring, then birth-giving). Concerning the\nreal contents of the mysteries, we learn through the testimony of Bishop\nAsterius, about 390 A.D., the following:\n\n  “Is not there (in Eleusis) the gloomiest descent, and the most solemn\n  communion of the hierophant and the priestess; between him and her\n  alone? Are the torches not extinguished, and does not the vast\n  multitude regard as their salvation that which takes place between the\n  two in the darkness?”[665]",
