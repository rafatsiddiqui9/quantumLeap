    "paragraph": "Hiawatha hears human speech in the sounds of Nature; thus he understands Nature\u2019s speech. The wind says, \u201cWawa.\u201d The cry of the wild goose is \u201cWawa.\u201d Wah-wah-taysee means the small glowworm which enchants him.

This implies that Hiawatha understands Nature's speech and that the natural world is closely interconnected with human language and thought.",
