Miss Miller had here the unspoken need of emphasizing her almost magic effect upon another person. This could not have happened, either, without an unconscious need, which is particularly felt by one who does not often succeed in making an emotional impression upon a fellow being.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the narrator describe their ability to influence another person in terms of creating the perception of places and atmospheres they have never experienced?", "answer": "The narrator describes their ability to make someone imagine landscapes, such as the Lake Geneva (Lake Léman), that they have never seen, and to instill a sense of an environment they have never felt directly. They note that they use the person as a mere instrument, similar to how the person uses their pencil, to create these experiences.", "question_group_id": "2139f276-22f6-4034-aa43-4a6467572161", "paragraph_idx": 11, "question_idx": 0}
