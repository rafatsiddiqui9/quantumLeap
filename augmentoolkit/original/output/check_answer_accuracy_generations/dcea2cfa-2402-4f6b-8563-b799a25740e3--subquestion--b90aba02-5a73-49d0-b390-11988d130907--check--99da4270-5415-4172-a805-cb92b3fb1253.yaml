- content: 'Text: """The retrospective longing acts like a paralyzing poison upon
    the energy and enterprise; so that it may well be compared to a poisonous serpent
    which lies across our path. Apparently, it is a hostile demon which robs us of
    energy, but, in reality, it is the individual unconscious, the retrogressive tendency
    of which begins to overcome the conscious forward striving. The cause of this
    can be, for example, the natural aging which weakens the energy, or it may be
    great external difficulties, which cause man to break down and become a child
    again, or it may be, and this is probably the most frequent cause, the woman who
    enslaves the man, so that he can no longer free himself, and becomes a child again.[618]
    It may be of significance also that Isis, as sister-wife of the sun-god, creates
    the poisonous animal from the spittle of the god, which is perhaps a substitute
    for sperma, and, therefore, is a symbol of libido. She creates the animal from
    the libido of the god; that means she receives his power, making him weak and
    dependent, so that by this means she assumes the dominating rôle of the mother.
    (Mother transference to the wife.) This part is preserved in the legend of Samson,
    in the rôle of Delilah, who cut off Samson’s hair, the sun’s rays, thus robbing
    him of his strength.[619] Any weakening of the adult man strengthens the wishes
