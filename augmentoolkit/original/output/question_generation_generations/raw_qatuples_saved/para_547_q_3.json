    "question": "Explain the significance of the longing for the sun in the narrative and how it relates to other longings mentioned.",
    "answer": "The longing for the sun in the narrative is significant because it represents a deep and universal longing for the divine or the source of all creation. This longing is similar to the desire for the ship's officer, indicating that the object of longing is not just a specific person or thing but a deeper, symbolic connection to the divine. This longing is seen as crucial, as it drives much of the narrative's themes and conflicts.",
