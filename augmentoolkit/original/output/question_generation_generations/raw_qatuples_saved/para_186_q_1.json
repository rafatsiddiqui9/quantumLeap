Above all, \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 is of great significance as a surname for \u1f38\u03b8\u03ac\u03c2, since the \u201cflaming one\u201d is the \u201cfore-thinker.\u201d (_Pramati_ = precaution is also an attribute of Agni, although _pramati_ is of another derivation.) Prometheus, however, belongs to the line of Phlegians which was placed by Kuhn in uncontested relationship to the Indian priest family of Bh\u1e5bgu.[289] The Bh\u1e5bgu are like M\u00e2tari\u00e7van (the \u201cone swelling in the mother\u201d), also fire-bringers. Kuhn quotes a passage, according to which Bh\u1e5bgu also arises from the flame like Agni. (\u201cIn the flame Bh\u1e5bgu originated. Bh\u1e5bgu roasted, but did not burn.\u201d) This view leads to a root related to Bh\u1e5bgu, that is to say, to the Sanskrit _bhr\u00e2y_ = to light, Latin _fulgeo_ and Greek \u03c6\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9 (Sanskrit _bhargas_ = splendor, Latin _fulgur_). Bh\u1e5bgu appears, therefore, as \u201cthe shining one.\u201d \u03a6\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cd\u03b1\u03c2 means a certain species of eagle, on account of its burnished gold color. The connection with \u03c6\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, which signifies \u201cto burn,\u201d is clear. The Phlegians are also the fire eagles.[290] Prometheus also belongs to the Phlegians. The path from Pramantha to Prometheus passes not through the word, but through the idea, and, therefore, we should adopt this same meaning for Prometheus as that which Pramantha attains from the Hindoo fire symbolism.[291]",

    "question": "What evidence supports the connection between Bh\u1e5bgu and the concept of fire and light?",
    "answer": "Bh\u1e5bgu is described as arising from the flame like Agni, and the Bh\u1e5bgu are associated with the root _bhr\u00e2y_ which means \"to light.\" This is also related to the Latin _fulgeo_ and Greek \u03c6\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9 (both meaning \"to burn\"), which is connected to the Sanskrit _bhargas_ (meaning \"splendor\") and _fulgur_ (lightning). Therefore, Bh\u1e5bgu is seen as the \"shining one.\"",
