    "paragraph": "In this poem nearly all the symbolism is collected which we have elaborated previously from other connections. Distinct traces of the primitive identity of serpent and hero are still extant in the myth of Cecrops. Cecrops is himself half-snake, half-man. Originally, he probably was the Athenian snake of the citadel itself. As a buried god, he is like Erechtheus, a chthonic snake god. Above his subterranean dwelling rises the Parthenon, the temple of the virgin goddess (compare the analogous idea of the Christian church). The casting of the skin of the god, which we have already mentioned in passing, stands in the closest relation to the nature of the hero. We have spoken already of the Mexican god who casts his skin. It is also told of Mani, the founder of the Manichaean sect, that he was killed, skinned, stuffed and hung up.[775] That is the death of Christ, merely in another mythological form.[776]Marsyas, who seems to be a substitute for Attis, the son-lover of Cybele, was also skinned.[777] Whenever a Scythian king died, slaves and horses were slaughtered, skinned and stuffed, and then set up again.[778] In Phrygia, the representatives of the father-god were killed and skinned. The same was done in Athens with an ox, who was skinned and stuffed and again hitched to the plough.In this manner the revival of the fertility of the earth was celebrated.[779]This readily explains the fragment from the Sabazios mysteries, transmitted to us by Firmicus:[780] \u03a4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd[781].",

    "question": "What is the symbolic connection between Cecrops and the Athenian snake of the citadel in the poem?",
    "answer": "Cecrops is described as half-snake, half-man, which connects him to the Athenian snake of the citadel itself. This suggests that Cecrops was originally a chthonic snake god representing the buried, protective deity of the city.",
