    "paragraph": "The vision following upon that of the city is that of a \u201cstrange fir tree with gnarled branches.\u201d This vision does not seem extraordinary to us after all that we have learned of the tree of life and its associations with the city and the waters of life. This especial tree seems simply to continue the category of the mother symbols. The attribute \u201cstrange\u201d probably signifies, as in dreams, a special emphasis, that is, a special underlying complex material. Unfortunately, the author gives us no individual material for this. As the tree already suggested in the symbolism of the city is particularly emphasized through the further development of Miss Miller\u2019s visions here, I find it necessary to discuss at some length the history of the symbolism of the tree.After the completed \u201cnight journey to the sea,\u201d the chest of Osiris was cast ashore by Byblos, and lay in the branches of an Erica, which grew around the coffin and became a splendid tree. The king of the land had the tree placed as a column under his roof.[474] During this period of Osiris\u2019s absence (the winter solstice) the lament customary during thousands of years for the dead god and his return occurs, and its \u03b5\u1f55\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is a feast of joy. A passage from the mournful quest of Isis is especially noteworthy:\u201cShe flutters like a swallow lamenting around the column, which  encloses the god sleeping in death.\u201d(This same motive returns in the Kyffh\u00e4user saga.)[Illustration: FRUCTIFICATION FOLLOWING UPON THE MITHRAIC SACRIFICE]",

    "question": "What is the vision described as a \"strange fir tree with gnarled branches\" and how does it relate to previous symbols?",
    "answer": "The vision of a \"strange fir tree with gnarled branches\" continues the category of mother symbols, similar to the tree of life. The term \"strange\" likely signifies a special emphasis or complex material, but the author does not provide specific details about this.",
