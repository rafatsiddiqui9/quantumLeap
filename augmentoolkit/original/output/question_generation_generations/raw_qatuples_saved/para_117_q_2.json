    "paragraph": "We know, from our own experience, this state of mind. It is an infantile stage. To a child the moon is a man or a face or a shepherd of the stars. The clouds in the sky seem like little sheep; the dolls drink, eat and sleep; the child places a letter at the window for the Christ-child; he calls to the stork to bring him a little brother or sister; the cow is the wife of the horse, and the dog the husband of the cat. We know, too, that lower races, like the negroes, look upon the locomotive as an animal, and call the drawers of the table the child of the table.",

    "question": "What is an example of how lower races or different cultures might view inanimate objects?\n\n**ANSISWER:**\nAn example of how lower races or different cultures might view inanimate objects is that they could look upon the locomotive as an animal, attributing it with animal characteristics and even calling the drawers of the table the child of the table. This shows a tendency to personify inanimate objects,\u8d4b\u4e88\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u66f4\u5177\u542f\u53d1\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6df1\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff1a\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does human imagination shape our perceptions of the world, even in adult life, based on the given examples?",
    "answer": "Human imagination shapes our perceptions of the world by attributing human or animal characteristics to inanimate objects. For instance, the moon being seen as a man, the clouds as sheep, and a locomotive as an animal. This imaginative interpretation helps us understand and relate to the world around us, even if it sometimes involves personification or anthropomorphism.",
