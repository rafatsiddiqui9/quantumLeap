    "paragraph": "\u201cAnd following It my spirit demanded to embrace the splendor beheld,  but it found It not as creature and did not succeed in coming out from  among created beings, so that it might embrace that uncreated and  uncomprehended splendor. Nevertheless it wandered everywhere, and  strove to behold It. _It penetrated the air, it wandered over the  Heavens, it crossed over the abysses, it searched, as it seemed to it,  the ends of the world._[138] But in all of that it found nothing, for  all was created. And I lamented and was sorrowful, and my breast  burned, and I lived as one distraught in mind. But It came, as It  would, and descending like a luminous mystic cloud, It seemed to  envelop my whole head so that dismayed I cried out. But flying away  again It left me alone. And when I, troubled, sought for It, I  realized suddenly _that It was in me, myself, and in the midst of my  heart It appeared as the light of a spherical sun_.\u201dIn Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cGlory and Eternity\u201d we meet with an essentially similar symbol:\u201cHush!

Then take the night which brings     The heart upon thy tongue, charmed wisdom mine!\u201cI look above, there rolls the star-strewn sea.     O night, mute silence, voiceless cry of stars!     And lo! A sign! The heaven its verge unbars\u2014     A shining constellation falls towards me.\u201d[139]It is not astonishing if Nietzsche\u2019s great inner loneliness calls again into existence certain forms of thought which the mystic ecstasy of the old cults has elevated to ritual representation. In the visions of the Mithraic liturgy we have to deal with many similar representations which we can now understand without difficulty as the ecstatic symbol of the libido:",
