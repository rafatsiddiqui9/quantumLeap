During the ascent through the\nanimal kingdom an important displacement in the fundamentals of the\nprocreative instinct has taken place. The mass of the reproductive\nproducts with the uncertainty of fertilization has more and more\nbeen replaced by a controlled impregnation and an effective\nprotection of the offspring. In this way part of the energy required\nin the production of eggs and sperma has been transposed into the\ncreation of mechanisms for allurement and for protection of the\nyoung. Thus we discover the first instincts of art in animals used\nin the service of the impulse of creation, and limited to the\nbreeding season. The original sexual character of these biological\ninstitutions became lost in their organic fixation and functional\nindependence. Even if there can be no doubt about the sexual origin\nof music, still it would be a poor, unæsthetic generalization if one\nwere to include music in the category of sexuality. A similar\nnomenclature would then lead us to classify the cathedral of Cologne\nas mineralogy because it is built of stones. It can be a surprise\nonly to those to whom the history of evolution is unknown to find\nhow few things there really are in human life which cannot be\nreduced in the last analysis to the instinct of procreation. It\nincludes very nearly everything, I think, which is beloved and dear\nto us. We spoke just now of libido as the creative impulse and at\nthe same time we allied ourselves with the conception which opposes\nlibido to hunger in the same way that the instinct of the\npreservation of the species is opposed to the instinct of\nself-preservation. In nature, this artificial distinction does not\nexist. Here we see only a continuous life impulse, a will to live\nwhich will attain the creation of the whole species through the\npreservation of the individual. Thus far this conception coincides\nwith the idea of the Will in Schopenhauer, for we can conceive Will\nobjectively, only as a manifestation of an internal desire. This\nthrowing of psychological perceptions into material reality is\ncharacterized philosophically as “introjection.” (Ferenczi’s\nconception of “introjection” denoted the reverse, that is, the\ntaking of the outer world into the inner world.)[251] Naturally, the\nconception of the world was distorted by introjection. Freud’s\nconception of the principle of desire is a voluntary formulation of\nthe idea of introjection, while his once more voluntarily conceived\n“principle of reality” corresponds functionally to that which I\ndesignate as “corrective of reality,” and R. Avenarius[252]\ndesignates as “empiriokritische Prinzipialkoordination.” The\nconception of power owes its existence to this very introjection;\nthis has already been said expressively by Galileo in his remark\nthat its origin is to be sought in the subjective perception of the\nmuscular power of the individual. Because we have already arrived at\nthe daring assumption that the libido, which was employed originally\nin the exclusive service of egg and seed production, now appears\nfirmly organized in the function of nest-building, and can no longer\nbe employed otherwise; similarly this conception forces us to relate\nit to every desire, including hunger. For now we can no longer make\nany essential distinction between the will to build a nest and the\nwill to eat. This view brings us to a conception of libido, which\nextends over the boundaries of the physical sciences into a\nphilosophical aspect—to a conception of the will in general. I must\ngive this bit of psychological “Voluntarismus” into the hands of the\nphilosophers for them to manage. For the rest I refer to the words\nof Schopenhauer[253] relating to this. In connection with the\npsychology of this conception (by which I understand neither\nmetapsychology nor metaphysics) I am reminded here of the cosmogenic\nmeaning of Eros in Plato and Hesiod,[254] and also of the orphic\nfigure of Phanes, the “_shining one_,” the first created, the\n“father of Eros.” Phanes has also orphically the significance of\nPriapus; he is a god of love, bisexual and similar to the Theban\nDionysus Lysios.[255] The orphic meaning of Phanes is similar to\nthat of the Indian Kâma, the god of love, which is also the\ncosmogenic principle. To Plotinus, of the Neo-Platonic school, the\nworld-soul is the energy of the intellect.[256] Plotinus compares\n“The One,” the creative primal principle, with light in general; the\nintellect with the Sun (♂), the world-soul with the moon (♀). In\nanother comparison Plotinus compares “The One” with the Father, the\nintellect with the Son.[257] The “One” designated as Uranus is\ntranscendent. The son as Kronos has dominion over the visible world.\nThe world-soul (designated as Zeus) appears as subordinate to him.\nThe “One,” or the Usia of the whole existence is designated by\nPlotinus as hypostatic, also as the three forms of emanation, also\nμία οὐσία ἐν τρισὶν ὑποστάσεσιν.[258] As Drews observed, this is\nalso the formula of the Christian Trinity (God the Father, God the\nSon, and God the Holy Ghost) as it was decided upon at the councils\nof Nicea and Constantinople.[259] It may also be noticed that\ncertain early Christian sectarians attributed a maternal\nsignificance to the Holy Ghost (world-soul, moon). (See what follows\nconcerning Chi of Timæus.) According to Plotinus, the world-soul has\na tendency toward a divided existence and towards divisibility, the\n_conditio sine qua non_ of all change, creation and procreation\n(also a maternal quality). It is an “unending all of life” and\nwholly energy; it is a living organism of ideas, which attain in it\neffectiveness and reality.[260] The intellect is its procreator, its\nfather, which, having conceived it, brings it to development in\nthought.[261]\n\n  “What lies enclosed in the intellect, comes to development in the\n  world-soul as logos, fills it with meaning and makes it as if\n  intoxicated with nectar.”[262]\n\nNectar is analogous to soma, the drink of fertility and of life, also to\nsperma. The soul is fructified by the intellect; as oversoul it is\ncalled heavenly Aphrodite, as the undersoul the earthly Aphrodite. “It\nknows the birth pangs,”[263] and so on. The bird of Aphrodite, the dove,\nis not without good cause the symbol of the Holy Ghost.\n\nThis fragment of the history of philosophy, which may easily be\nenlarged, shows the significance of the endopsychic perception of the\nlibido and of its symbolism in human thought.\n\nIn the diversity of natural phenomena we see the desire, the libido, in\nthe most diverse applications and forms. We see the libido in the stage\nof childhood almost wholly occupied in the instinct of nutrition, which\ntakes care of the upbuilding of the body. With the development of the\nbody there are successively opened new spheres of application for the\nlibido. The last sphere of application, and surpassing all the others in\nits functional significance, is sexuality, which seems at first almost\nbound up with the function of nutrition. (Compare with this the\ninfluence on procreation of the conditions of nutrition in lower animals\nand plants.) In the territory of sexuality, the libido wins that\nformation, the enormous importance of which has justified us in the use\nof the term libido in general. Here the libido appears very properly as\nan impulse of procreation, and almost in the form of an undifferentiated\nsexual primal libido, as an energy of growth, which clearly forces the\nindividual towards division, budding, etc. (The clearest distinction\nbetween the two forms of libido is to be found among those animals in\nwhom the stage of nutrition is separated from the sexual stage by a\nchrysalis stage.)\n\nFrom that sexual primal libido which produced millions of eggs and seeds\nfrom one small creature derivatives have been developed with the great\nlimitation of the fecundity; derivatives in which the functions are\nmaintained by a special differentiated libido. This differentiated\nlibido is henceforth desexualized because it is dissociated from its\noriginal function of egg and sperma production; nor is there any\npossibility of restoring it to its original function. Thus, in general,\nthe process of development consists in an increasing transformation of\nthe primal libido which only produced products of generation to the\nsecondary functions of allurement and protection of the young. This now\npresupposes a very different and very complicated relation to reality, a\ntrue function of reality, which, functionally inseparable, is bound up\nwith the needs of procreation. Thus the altered mode of procreation\ncarries with it as a correlate a correspondingly heightened adaptation\nto reality.[264]\n\nIn this way we attain an insight into certain primitive conditions of\nthe function of reality. It would be radically wrong to say that its\ncompelling power is a sexual one. It was a sexual one to a large extent.\nThe process of transformation of the primal libido into secondary\nimpulses always took place in the form of affluxes of sexual libido,\nthat is to say, sexuality became deflected from its original destination\nand a portion of it turned, little by little, increasing in amount, into\nthe phylogenetic impulse of the mechanisms of allurement and of\nprotection of the young. This diversion of the sexual libido from the\nsexual territory into associated functions is still taking place.[265]\nWhere this operation succeeds without injury to the adaptation of the\nindividual it is called _sublimation_. Where the attempt does not\nsucceed it is called _repression_.\n\nThe descriptive standpoint of psychology accepts the multiplicity of\ninstincts, among which is the sexual instinct, as a special phenomenon;\nmoreover, it recognizes certain affluxes of libido to non-sexual\ninstincts.\n\nQuite otherwise is the genetic standpoint. It regards the multiplicity\nof instincts as issuing from a relative unity, the primal libido;[266]\nit recognizes that definite amounts of the primal libido are split off,\nas it were, associated with the newly formed functions and finally\nmerged in them. As a result of this it is impossible, from the genetic\nstandpoint, to hold to the strictly limited conception of libido of the\ndescriptive standpoint; it leads inevitably to a broadening of the\nconception. With this we come to the theory of libido that I have\nsurreptitiously introduced into the first part of this work for the\npurpose of making this genetic conception familiar to the reader. The\nexplanation of this harmless deceit I have saved until the second part.\n\nFor the first time, through this genetic idea of libido, which in every\nway surpasses the descriptive sexual, the transference was made possible\nof the Freudian libido theory into the psychology of mental disease. The\npassage quoted above shows how the present Freudian conception of libido\ncollides with the problem of the psychoses.[267] Therefore, when I speak\nof libido, I associate with it the genetic conception which contains not\nonly the immediate sexual but also an amount of desexualized primal\nlibido. When I say a sick person takes his libido away from the outer\nworld, in order to take possession of the inner world with it, I do not\nmean that he takes away merely the affluxes from the function of\nreality, but he takes energy away, according to my view, from those\ndesexualized instincts which regularly and properly support the function\nof reality.\n\nWith this alteration in the libido conception, certain parts of our\nterminology need revision as well. As we know, Abraham has undertaken\nthe experiment of transferring the Freudian libido theory to dementia\npræcox and has conceived the characteristic lack of rapport and the\ncessation of the function of reality as autoerotism. This conception\nneeds revision. Hysterical introversion of the libido leads to\nautoerotism, since the patient’s erotic afflux of libido designed for\nthe function of adaptation is introverted, whereby his ego is occupied\nby the corresponding amount of erotic libido. The schizophrenic,\nhowever, shuns reality far more than merely the erotic afflux would\naccount for; therefore, his inner condition is very different from that\nof the hysteric. He is more than autoerotic, he builds up an\nintra-psychic equivalent for reality, for which purpose he has\nnecessarily to employ other dynamics than that afforded by the erotic\nafflux. Therefore, I must grant to Bleuler the right to reject the\nconception of autoerotism, taken from the study of hysterical neuroses,\nand there legitimate, and to replace it by the conception of\nautismus.[268] I am forced to say that this term is better fitted to\nfacts than autoerotism. With this I acknowledge my earlier idea of the\nidentity of autismus (Bleuler) and autoerotism (Freud) as unjustified,\nand, therefore, retract it.[269] This thorough revision of the\nconception of libido has compelled me to this.",
  "llm_raw_response": "I have broken down the given text into coherent sections by topic:\n\n**Section 1: The Evolution of the Procreative Instinct**\n\nThe text begins by discussing the evolution of the procreative instinct in animals. It explains how the fundamental impulse of propagation has been replaced by controlled impregnation and effective protection of offspring. This has led to a transposition of energy from the production of eggs and sperm to the creation of mechanisms for allurement and protection of young.\n\n**Section 2: The Origins of Art and the Libido**\n\nThe text then explores the origins of art in animals, which is used in the service of the impulse of creation, limited to the breeding season. It discusses how the original sexual character of these biological institutions became lost in their organic fixation and functional independence. The text also touches on the concept of libido and its relationship to art.\n\n**Section 3: The Conception of the Will and the World-Soul**\n\nThe text delves into the concept of the will and the world-soul, drawing parallels with the ideas of Schopenhauer and Plato. It explains how the world-soul is the energy of the intellect, and how it is compared to light, the sun, and the moon. The text also discusses the concept of introjection and its relationship to the world-soul.\n\n**Section 4: The Libido and its Symbolism**\n\nThe text explores the symbolism of the libido, which is seen as a manifestation of an internal desire. It discusses how the libido appears in various forms, including the stage of childhood, where it is almost wholly occupied with the instinct of nutrition. The text also explains how the libido is transformed into secondary impulses, such as allurement and protection of the young.\n\n**Section 5: The Genetic Standpoint and the Theory of Libido**\n\nThe text discusses the genetic standpoint, which regards the multiplicity of instincts as issuing from a relative unity, the primal libido. It explains how definite amounts of the primal libido are split off and merged with newly formed functions. This leads to a broadening of the conception of libido, which is seen as a relative unity.\n\n**Section 6: The Transference of the Freudian Libido Theory**\n\nThe text discusses how the genetic idea of libido surpasses the descriptive sexual conception of libido. It explains how this leads to the transference of the Freudian libido theory into the psychology of mental disease. The text also touches on the concept of autoerotism and its limitations.\n\n**Section 7: Revision of Terminology**\n\nThe text concludes by discussing the need for revision of terminology, particularly in the context of dementia praecox and schizophrenia. It introduces the concept of autismus, which is seen as a more accurate term than autoerotism. The text also acknowledges the earlier idea of the identity of autismus and autoerotism as unjustified.",
