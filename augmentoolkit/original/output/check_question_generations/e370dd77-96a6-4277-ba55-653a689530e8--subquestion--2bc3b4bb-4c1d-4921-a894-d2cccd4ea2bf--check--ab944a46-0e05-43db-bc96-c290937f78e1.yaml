    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ pieces. We come upon the _motive of dismemberment_ in countless sun myths,[475]\
    \ namely, the inversion of the idea of the composition of the child in the mother’s\
    \ womb.[476] In fact, the mother Isis collects the pieces of the body with the\
    \ help of the jackal-headed Anubis. (She finds the corpse with the help of dogs.)\
    \ Here the nocturnal devourers of bodies, the dogs and jackals, become the assistants\
    \ of the composition, of the reproduction.[477] The Egyptian vulture owes its\
    \ symbolic meaning as mother to this necrophagic habit. In Persian antiquity the\
    \ corpses were thrown out for the dogs to devour, just as to-day in the Indian\
    \ funeral pyres the removal of the carcasses is left to the vultures. Persia was\
    \ familiar with the custom of leading a dog to the bed of one dying, whereupon\
    \ the latter had to present the dog with a morsel.[478] The custom, on its surface,\
    \ evidently signifies that the morsel is to belong to the dog, so that he will\
    \ spare the body of the dead, precisely as Cerberus was soothed by the honey-cakes\
    \ which Hercules gave to him in the journey to hell. But when we bear in mind\
    \ the jackal-headed Anubis who rendered his good services in the gathering together\
    \ of the dismembered Osiris, and the mother significance of the vulture, then\
    \ the question arises whether something deeper was not meant by this ceremony.\
    \ Creuzer has also concerned himself with this idea, and has come to the conclusion\
    \ that the astral form of the dog ceremony, that is, the appearance of Sirius,\
    \ the dog star, at the period of the sun’s highest position, is related to this\
    \ in that the introduction of the dog has a compensatory significance, death being\
    \ thereby made, reversedly, equal to the sun’s highest position. This is quite\
    \ in conformity with psychologic thought, which results from the very general\
    \ fact that death is interpreted as entrance into the mother’s womb (rebirth).\n\
