It is an incredibly phantastic conception that, beside the\ngods, ordinary “wise men” unite in sacrificing the primitive being,\naside from the circumstance that, beside the primitive being, nothing\nhad existed in the beginning (that is to say, before the sacrifice), as\nwe shall soon see. If the great mystery of the mother sacrifice is meant\nthereby, then all becomes clear:\n\n               “From that great general sacrifice\n               The dripping fat was gathered up.\n               He formed the creatures of the air,\n               And animals both wild and tame.\n               From that great general sacrifice\n               Richas and Sama-hymns were born;\n               Therefrom the metres were produced,\n               The Yajus had its birth from it.\n\n               “The moon was gendered from his mind\n               And from his eye the Sun had birth;\n               Indra and Agni from his mouth\n               Were born, and Vâyu from his breath.\n\n               “Forth from his navel came midair;\n               The sky was fashioned from his head;\n               Earth from his feet, and from his ears\n               The regions. Thus they formed the worlds.”\n\nIt is evident that by this is meant not a physical, but a psychological\ncosmogony. The world arises when man discovers it. He discovers it when\nhe sacrifices the mother; that is to say, when he has freed himself from\nthe midst of his unconscious lying in the mother. That which impels him\nforward to this discovery may be interpreted psychologically as the\nso-called “Incest barrier” of Freud. The incest prohibition places an\nend to the childish longing for the food-giving mother, and compels the\nlibido, gradually becoming sexual, into the path of the biological aim.\nThe libido forced away from the mother by the incest prohibition seeks\nfor the sexual object in the place of the forbidden mother. In this\nwider psychologic sense, which expresses itself in the allegoric\nlanguage of the “incest prohibition,” “mother,” etc., must be understood\nFreud’s paradoxical sentence, “Originally we have known only sexual\nobjects.”[811] This sentence must be understood psychologically\nthroughout, in the sense of a world image created from within outwards,\nwhich has, in the first place, nothing to do with the so-called\n“objective” idea of the world. This is to be understood as a new edition\nof the subjective idea of the world corrected by reality. Biology, as a\nscience of objective experience, would have to reject unconditionally\nFreud’s proposition, for, as we have made clear above, the function of\nreality can only be partly sexual; in another equally important part it\nis self-preservation. The matter appears different for that thought\nwhich accompanies the biological function as an epiphenomenon. As far as\nour knowledge reaches, the individual act of thought is dependent wholly\nor in greatest part on the existence of a highly differentiated brain,\nwhereas the function of reality (adaptation to reality) is something\nwhich occurs in all living nature as wholly independent from the act of\nthought. This important proposition of Freud’s applies only to the act\nof thought, for thinking, as we may recognize from manifold traces,\narose dynamically from the libido, which was split off from the original\nobject at the “incest barrier” and became actual when the first budding\nsexual emotions began to flow in the current of the libido which goes to\nthe mother. Through the incest barrier the sexual libido is forced away\nfrom the identification with the parents, and introverted for lack of\nadequate activity. It is the sexual libido which forces the growing\nindividual slowly away from his family. If this necessity did not exist,\nthen the family would always remain clustered together in a solid group.\nHence the neurotic always renounces a complete erotic experience,[812]\nin order that he may remain a child. Phantasies seem to arise from the\nintroversion of the sexual libido. Since the first childish phantasies\nmost certainly do not attain the quality of a conscious plan, and as\nphantasies likewise (even among adults) are almost always the direct\nderivates of the unconscious, it is, therefore, highly probable that the\nfirst phantastic manifestations arise from an act of regression. As we\nillustrated earlier, the regression goes back to the presexual stage, as\nmany traces show. Here the sexual libido obtains again, so to speak,\nthat universal capacity of application, or capacity for displacement,\nwhich it actually possessed at that stage when the sexual application\nwas not yet discovered. Naturally, no adequate object is found in the\npresexual stage for the regressive sexual libido, but only surrogates,\nwhich always leave a wish; namely, the wish to have the surrogate as\nsimilar as possible to the sexual goal. This wish is secret, however,\nfor it is really an incest wish. The unsatisfied unconscious wish\ncreates innumerable secondary objects, symbols for the primitive object,\nthe mother (as the Rigveda says, the creator of the world, “hiding his\norigin,” enters into things). From this the thought or the phantasies\nproceed, as a desexualized manifestation of _an originally sexual\nlibido_.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the libido, the term “incest barrier” corresponds\nto one aspect, but the matter, however, may be considered from another\npoint of view.\n\nThe time of undeveloped sexuality, about the third and the fourth year,\nis, at the same time, considered externally, the period when the child\nfinds himself confronted with increased demands from the world of\nreality. He can walk, speak and independently attend to a number of\nother things. He sees himself in a relation to a world of unlimited\npossibilities, but in which he dares to do little or nothing, because he\nis as yet too much of a baby and cannot get on without his mother. At\nthis time mother should be exchanged for the world. Against this the\npast rises as the greatest resistance; this is always so whenever man\nwould undertake a new adaptation. In spite of all evidence and against\nall conscious resolutions, the unconscious (the past) always enforces\nits standpoint as resistance. In this difficult position, precisely at\nthis period of developing sexuality, we see the dawning of the mind. The\nproblem of the child at this period is the discovery of the world and of\nthe great transsubjective reality. For that he must lose the mother;\nevery step out into the world means a step away from the mother.\nNaturally, all that which is retrogressive in men rebels against this\nstep, and energetic attempts are made against this adaptation in the\nfirst place. Therefore, this period of life is also that in which the\nfirst clearly developed neuroses arise. The tendency of this age is one\ndirectly opposed to that of dementia præcox. The child seeks to win the\nworld and to leave the mother (this is a necessary result). The dementia\npræcox patient, however, seeks to leave the world and to regain the\nsubjectivity of childhood. We have seen that in dementia præcox the\nrecent adaptation to reality is replaced by an archaic mode of\nadaptation; that is to say, the recent idea of the world is rejected in\nfavor of an archaic idea of the world. When the child renounces his task\nof adaptation to reality, or has considerable difficulties in this\ndirection, then we may expect that the recent adaptation will again be\nreplaced by archaic modes of adaptation. It would, therefore, be\nconceivable that through regression in children archaic products would\nnaturally be unearthed; that is to say, old ways of functioning of the\nthought system, which is inborn with the brain differentiation, would be\nawakened.\n\nAccording to my available but as yet unpublished material, a remarkably\narchaic and at the same time generally applicable character seems to\nappertain to infantile phantasy, quite comparable with the products of\ndementia præcox. It does not seem improbable that through regression at\nthis age those same associations of elements and analogies are\nreawakened which formerly constituted the archaic idea of the world.\nWhen we now attempt to investigate the nature of these elements, a\nglance at the psychology of myths is sufficient to show us that the\narchaic idea was chiefly sexual anthropomorphism. It appears that these\nthings in the unconscious childish phantasy play an extraordinary rôle,\nas we can recognize from examples taken at random. Just as the sexualism\nof neuroses is not to be taken literally but as regressive phantasy and\nsymbolic compensation for a recent unachieved adaptation, so is the\nsexualism of the early infantile phantasy, especially the incest\nproblem, a regressive product of the revival of the archaic modes of\nfunction, outweighing actuality. On this account I have expressed myself\nvery vaguely in this work, I am sure, in regard to the incest problem.\nThis is done in order not to be responsible for the idea that I\nunderstand by it a gross sexual inclination towards the parents. The\ntrue facts of the case are much more complicated, as my investigations\npoint out. Originally incest probably never possessed particularly great\nsignificance as such, because cohabitation with an old woman for all\npossible motives could hardly be preferred to mating with a young woman.\nIt seems that the mother has acquired incestuous significance only\npsychologically. Thus, for example, the incestuous unions of antiquity\nwere not a result of a love inclination, but of a special superstition,\nwhich is most intimately bound up with the mythical ideas here treated.\nA Pharaoh of the second dynasty is said to have married his sister, his\ndaughter and his granddaughter; the Ptolemies were accustomed also to\nmarriage with sisters; Kambyses married his sister; Artaxerxes married\nhis two daughters; Qobad I (sixth century A. D.) married his daughter.\nThe Satrap Sysimithres married his mother. These incestuous unions are\nexplained by the circumstance that in the Zend Avesta the marriage of\nrelatives was directly commanded;[813] it emphasized the resemblance of\nrulers to the divinity, and, therefore, was more of an artificial than a\nnatural arrangement, because it originated more from a theoretical than\nfrom a biological inclination. (A practical impetus towards that lay\noften in the peculiar laws of inheritance left over from the _Mutter\nrecht_, “maternal right” [matriarchal], period.) The confusion which\ncertainly frequently involved the barbarians of antiquity in regard to\nthe choice of their sexual objects cannot very well be measured by the\nstandard of present-day love psychology. In any case, the incest of the\nsemi-animal past is in no way proportionate to the enormous significance\nof the incest phantasy among civilized people. This disproportion\nenforces the assumption that the incest prohibition which we meet even\namongst relatively lower races concerns rather the mythical ideas than\nthe biological damage; therefore, the ethnical prohibition almost always\nconcerns the mother and seldom the father. Incest prohibition can be\nunderstood, therefore, as a result of regression, and as the result of a\nlibidinous anxiety, which regressively attacks the mother. Naturally, it\nis difficult or impossible to say from whence this anxiety may have\ncome. I merely venture to suggest that it may have been a question of a\nprimitive separation of the pairs of opposites which are hidden in the\nwill of life: the will for life and for death. It remains obscure what\nadaptation the primitive man tried to evade through introversion and\nregression to the parents; but, according to the analogy of the soul\nlife in general, it may be assumed that the libido, which disturbed the\ninitial equilibrium of becoming and of ceasing to be, had been stored up\nin the attempt to make an especially difficult adaptation, and from\nwhich it recedes even to-day.\n\nAfter this long digression, let us turn back to the song of the Rigveda.\nThinking and a conception of the world arose from a shrinking back from\nstern reality, and it is only after man has regressively assured himself\nagain of the protective parental power[814] that he enters life wrapped\nin a dream of childhood shrouded in magic superstitions; that is to say,\n“thinking,”[815] for he, timidly sacrificing his best and assuring\nhimself of the favor of the invisible powers, step by step develops to\ngreater power, in the degree that he frees himself from his\nretrogressive longing and the original lack of harmony in his being.\n\nRigveda 10, 90, concludes with the exceedingly significant verse, which\nis of greatest importance for the Christian mysteries as well:\n\n “Gods, sacrificing, rendered homage to the sacrifice: these were the\n    earliest holy ordinances,\n The mighty ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sâdhyas,\n    goddesses of old, are dwelling.”\n\nThrough the sacrifice a fulness of power was attained, which extends up\nto the power of the “parents.” Thus the sacrifice has also the meaning\nof a psychologic maturation process.\n\nIn the same manner that the world originated through sacrifice, through\nthe renunciation of the retrospective mother libido, thus, according to\nthe teachings of the Upanishads, is produced the new condition of man,\nwhich may be termed the immortal. This new condition is again attained\nthrough a sacrifice; namely, through the sacrificial horse which is\ngiven a cosmic significance in the teaching of the Upanishads. What the\nsacrificial horse means is told by Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 1: 1:\n\n                                  “_Om!_",
