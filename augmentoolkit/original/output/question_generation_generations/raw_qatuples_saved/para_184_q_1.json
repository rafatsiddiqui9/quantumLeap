Though in the deep           I find not my face,           Burning, I long           For the water\u2019s balm;           And now as I am,           Spring in the stream.[788]           O might its billows           Engulf me in bliss.\u201dThe motive of plunging into the maternal water of rebirth (baptism) is here fully developed. An allusion to the \u201cterrible mother\u201d imago, the mother of heroes, who teaches them fear, is to be found in Brunhilde\u2019s words (the horse-woman, who guides the dead to the other side):\u201cFearest thou, Siegfried?            Fearest thou not            The wild, furious woman?\u201dThe orgiastic \u201cOccide moriturus\u201d resounds in Brunhilde\u2019s words:\u201cLaughing let us be lost\u2014            Laughing go down to death!\u201dAnd in the words\u201cLight-giving love,              Laughing death!\u201dis to be found the same significant contrast.The further destinies of Siegfried are those of the Invictus: the spear of the gloomy, one-eyed Hagen strikes Siegfried\u2019s vulnerable spot. The old sun, who has become the god of death, the one-eyed Wotan, smites his offspring, and once again ascends in eternal rejuvenation. The course of the invincible sun has supplied the mystery of human life with beautiful and imperishable symbols; it became a comforting fulfilment of all the yearning for immortality, of all desire of mortals for eternal life.",

    "question": "The text mentions an allusion to the \"terrible mother\" imago. What does this figure represent in the context of Siegfried's journey, and how does it relate to Brunhilde's character?",
    "answer": "The \"terrible mother\" imago represents a figure who teaches heroes to face their fears. In the context of Siegfried's journey, this could be related to Brunhilde, who guides the dead to the other side. Her words, \"Fearest thou, Siegfried? Fearest thou not the wild, furious woman?\" allude to this role, suggesting that she might embody the \"terrible mother\" who teaches Siegfried to confront his fears.",
