    \ text, and a question based on the paragraphs, you will make a determination\
    \ as to whether the question tests ONLY information in the paragraphs. Essentially:\
    \ you will check if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs.\
    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\
    \ at the very end of your response, your \"final judgment\" or \"final answer\"\
    , you will write \"Relevant\" or \"Irrelevant\" depending on your analysis of\
    \ the question with regards to the text. \n\nNote a special exception: if a question\
    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\
    \ not implicitly or implied) mentioned by the paragraphs as having been covered\
    \ earlier, then that question is relevant. Essentially: questions are allowed\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\
