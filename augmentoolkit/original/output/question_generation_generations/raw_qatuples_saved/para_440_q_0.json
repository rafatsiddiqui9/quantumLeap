    "paragraph": "The primitive symbol, which designates that portion of the Zodiac in which the Sun, with the Winter Solstice, again enters upon the yearly course, is the goat, fish sign, the \u03b1\u1f30\u03b3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2. The Sun mounts like a goat to the highest mountain, and later goes into the water as a fish. The fish is the symbol of the child,[388] for the child before his birth lives in the water like a fish, and the Sun, because it plunges into the sea, becomes equally child and fish. The fish, however, is also a phallic symbol,[389] also a symbol for the woman.[390] Briefly stated, the fish is a libido symbol, and, indeed, as it seems predominately _for the renewal of the libido_.The journey of Moses with his servant is a life-journey (eighty years). They grow old and lose their life force (libido), that is, they lose the fish which \u201cpursues its course in a marvellous manner to the sea,\u201d which means the setting of the sun. When the two notice their loss, they discover at the place where the \u201csource of life\u201d is found (where the dead fish revived and sprang into the sea) Chidher wrapped in his mantle,[391] sitting on the ground. According to another version, he sat on an island in the sea, or \u201cin the wettest place on earth,\u201d that is, he was just _born from the maternal depths_. Where the fish vanished Chidher, \u201cthe verdant one,\u201d was born as a \u201cson of the deep waters,\u201d his head veiled, a Cabir, a proclaimer of divine wisdom; the old Babylonian Oannes-Ea, who was represented in the form of a fish, and daily came from the sea as a fish to teach the people wisdom.[392] His name was brought into connection with John\u2019s. With the rising of the renewed sun all that lived in darkness, as water-animal or fish, surrounded by all terrors of night and death,[393] became as the shining fiery firmament of the day. Thus the words of John the Baptist[394] gain especial meaning:",

    "answer": "The symbol \u03b1\u1f30\u03b3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 (goat-fish) represents the transition of the Sun from the goat phase, where it climbs to the highest mountain, to the fish phase, where it enters the water. This symbol also signifies the child, as the child before birth lives in the water like a fish, and it can be seen as a phallic symbol and a symbol for the woman.",
