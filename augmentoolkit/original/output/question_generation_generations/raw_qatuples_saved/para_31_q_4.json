    "paragraph": "Any one who can read Freud\u2019s \u201cInterpretation of the Dream\u201d without scientific rebellion at the newness and apparently unjustified daring of its analytical presentation, and without moral indignation at the astonishing nudity of the dream interpretation, and who can allow this unusual array of facts to influence his mind calmly and without prejudice, will surely be deeply impressed at that place where Freud calls to mind the fact that an individual psychologic conflict, namely, the Incest Phantasy, is the essential root of that powerful ancient dramatic material, the Oedipus legend. The impression made by this simple reference may be likened to that wholly peculiar feeling which arises in us if, for example, in the noise and tumult of a modern street we should come across an ancient relic\u2014the Corinthian capital of a walled-in column, or a fragment of inscription. Just a moment ago we were given over to the noisy ephemeral life of the present, when something very far away and strange appears to us, which turns our attention to things of another order; a glimpse away from the incoherent multiplicity of the present to a higher coherence in history. Very likely it would suddenly occur to us that on this spot where we now run busily to and fro a similar life and activity prevailed two thousand years ago in somewhat other forms; similar passions moved mankind, and man was likewise convinced of the uniqueness of his existence. I would liken the impression which the first acquaintance with the monuments of antiquity so easily leaves behind to that impression which Freud\u2019s reference to the Oedipus legend makes\u2014for while we are still engaged with the confusing impressions of the variability of the Individual Soul, suddenly there is opened a revelation of the simple greatness of the Oedipus tragedy\u2014that never extinguished light of the Grecian theatre.",

    "question": "What is the impression made by Freud\u2019s reference to the Oedipus tragedy in relation to the complexity of individual souls?",
    "answer": "Freud\u2019s reference to the Oedipus tragedy provides a revelation of the simple greatness of the Oedipus tragedy, offering a moment of clarity and coherence in the midst of the complex and variable nature of individual souls. This reference brings a light of understanding to the historical and enduring themes of human experience, much like how encountering ancient relics provides a glimpse into a different and significant historical period.",
