    "paragraph": "The acceptance of these statements demands the recognition of the existence of an infantile sexuality and the large part played by it in the later life of the individual. Because of the power and imperious influence exerted by the parents upon the child, and because of the unconscious attachment of his libido to the original object, the mother, and the perseverance of this first love model in the psyche, he finds it very difficult, on reaching the stage of adult development and the time for seeking a love object outside of the family, to gain a satisfactory model.It is exceedingly important for parents and teachers to recognize the requirements of nature, which, beginning with puberty, imperiously demand of the young individual a separation of himself from the parent stem and the development of an independent existence. In our complex modern civilization this demand of nature is difficult enough of achievement for the child who has the heartiest and most intelligent co-operation of his parents and environment\u2014but for the one who has not only to contend with his own inner struggle for his freedom but has in addition the resistance of his parents who would hold him in his childhood at any cost, because they cannot endure the thought of his separation from them, the task becomes one of the greatest magnitude. It is during this period when the struggle between the childish inertia and nature\u2019s urge becomes so keen, that there occur the striking manifestations of jealousy, criticism, irritability all usually directed against the parents, of defiance of parental authority, of runaways and various other psychic and nervous disorders known to all.",

    "question": "What is the importance of parents and teachers recognizing the requirements of nature?\n\n**ANS:** parents and teachers must recognize the requirements of nature, which begin with puberty and demand that the young individual separate from the parent stem and develop an independent existence.

    "answer": "A child who must contend with both inner struggles for freedom and parental resistance, which stems from the parents' inability to endure the thought of separation, faces a significant and challenging task. The task becomes of the greatest magnitude because the child must not only overcome their own internal conflicts but also deal with the opposition from parents who want to keep them in childhood at all costs.",
