{"paragraph": "“But when the sun is set, O Yayñavalkya, and the moon has set, and the  fire is extinguished, what then serves man as light? Then speech  serves him as light; then, by the light of speech he sits, and moves,  he carries on his work, and he returns home. But when the sun is set,  O Yayñavalkya, and the moon is set, and the fire extinguished, and the  voice is dumb, what then serves man as light? Then he serves himself  (Atman) as light; then, by the light of himself, he sits and moves,  carries on his work and returns home.”In this passage we notice that fire again stands in the closest relation to speech. Speech itself is called a “light,” which, in its turn, is reduced to the “light” of the Atman, the creating psychic force, the libido. Thus the Hindoo metapsychology conceives speech and fire as emanations of the inner light from which we know that it is libido. Speech and fire are its forms of manifestation, the first human arts, which have resulted from its transformation. This common psychologic origin seems also to be indicated by certain results of philology. The Indo-Germanic root _bhâ_ designates the idea of “to lighten, to shine.” This root is found in Greek, φάω, φαίνω, φάος[322]; in old Icelandic _bán_ = white, in New High German _bohnen_ = to make shining. The same root _bhâ_ also designates “to speak”; it is found in Sanskrit _bhan_ = to speak, Armenian _ban_ = word, in New High German _bann_ = to banish, Greek φᾱ-μί, ἔφαν, φấτις.[323] Latin _fâ-ri_, _fânum_.The root _bhelso_, with the meanings “to ring, to bark,” is found in Sanskrit _bhas_ = to bark and _bhâs_ = to talk, to speak; Lithuanian _balsas_ = voice, tone. Really _bhel-sô_ = to be bright or luminous. Compare Greek φάλος = bright, Lithuanian _bálti_ = to become white, Middle High German _blasz_ = pale.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "In which specific passage is speech and fire said to be an emanation of the inner light from which the Atman, the creating psychic force or libido, is known, and how are they described in relation to the Atman?", "answer": "In the passage, speech and fire are said to be an emanation of the inner light from which the Atman, the creating psychic force or libido, is known.
