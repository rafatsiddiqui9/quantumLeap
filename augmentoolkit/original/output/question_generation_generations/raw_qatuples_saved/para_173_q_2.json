    "paragraph": "These wise words contain, in fact, the saving thought. It is not the mother who has placed the poisonous worm in our path, but our libido itself wills to complete the course of the sun to mount from morn to noon, and, passing beyond noon, to hasten towards evening, not at war with itself, but willing the descent and the end.[785]Nietzsche\u2019s Zarathustra teaches:\u201cI praise thee, my death, the free death, which comes to me because I  want it.\u201cAnd when shall I want it?\u201cHe who has a goal and an heir wants death at the proper time for his  goal and his heir.\u201cAnd this is the great noonday, when man in the middle of his course  stands between man and superman, and celebrates his path towards  evening as his highest hope: because it is the path to a new morning.\u201cHe who is setting will bless his own going down because it is a  transition: and the sun of his knowledge will be at high noon.\u201dSiegfried conquers the father Wotan and takes possession of Brunhilde. The first object that he sees is her horse; then he believes that he beholds a mail-clad man. He cuts to pieces the protecting coat of mail of the sleeper. (Overpowering.) When he sees it is a woman, terror seizes him:\u201cMy heart doth falter and faint;          On whom shall I call          That he may help me?          Mother! Mother!          Remember me!\u201cCan this be fearing?          Oh, mother! Mother!          Thy dauntless child!          A woman lieth asleep:\u2014          And she now has taught him to fear!\u201cAwaken! Awaken!          Holiest maid!          Then life from the sweetness of lips          Will I win me\u2014          E\u2019en tho\u2019 I die in a kiss.\u201dIn the duet which follows the mother is invoked:\u201cO mother, hail!            Who gave thee thy birth!\u201d",

    "question": "How does the invocation of the mother in the duet reflect on the theme of fear and feminine influence?",
    "answer": "The invocation of the mother in the duet reflects on the theme of fear and the influence of the feminine. It shows how encountering the unfamiliar and the unexpected, such as Brunhilde as a woman, can evoke a sense of fear and a need for guidance. The mother's invocation symbolizes the comfort and strength that traditional feminine figures can provide in moments of fear and transformation, reinforcing the idea that the feminine can be a source of support and reassurance.",
