{"paragraph": "Faust takes the reverse course; for him the ascetic ideal means death. He struggles for freedom and wins life, at the same time giving himself over to the Evil One; but through this he becomes the bringer of death to her whom he loves most, Marguerite. He tears himself away from pain and sacrifices his life in unceasing useful work, through which he saves many lives.[114] His double mission as saviour and destroyer has already been hinted in a preliminary manner:_Wagner_:With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou        Receive the people\u2019s honest veneration!_Faust_:Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,      Among these vales and hills surrounding,      Worse than the pestilence, have passed.      Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;      And I must hear, by all the living,      The shameless murderers praised at last!A parallel to this double r\u00f4le is that text in the Gospel of Matthew which has become historically significant:\u201cI came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d\u2014_Matt._ x: 34.Just this constitutes the deep significance of Goethe\u2019s Faust, that he clothes in words a problem of modern man which has been turning in restless slumber since the Renaissance, just as was done by the drama of Oedipus for the Hellenic sphere of culture.
