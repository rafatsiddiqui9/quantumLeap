    case, for the idea of the masculine creative deity is a derivation, analytically

    to replace the discarded infantile father transference in such a way that for
    the individual the passing from the narrow circle of the family into the wider
    circle of human society may be simpler or made easier.In the light of this reflection,
    we can see, in the poem and its “Praeludium,” the religious, poetically formed
    product of an introversion depending upon the surrogate of the “Father-Imago.”
    In spite of the incomplete apperception of the effectual impression, essential
    component parts of this are included in the idea of compensation, as marks, so
    to speak, of its origin. (Pfister has coined for this the striking expression,
    “Law of the Return of the Complex.”) The effectual impression was that of the
    officer singing in the night watch, “When the morning stars sang together.” The
    idea of this opened a new world to the girl. (Creation.)This creator has created
    tone, then light, and then love. That the first to be created should have been
    tone, can be made clear only individually, for there is no cosmogony except the
    Gnosis of Hermes, a generally quite unknown system, which would have such tendencies.
    But now we might venture a conjecture, which is already apparent, and which soon
