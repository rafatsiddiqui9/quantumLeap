    "paragraph": "The figures of the Miller dramas, being children of the creator\u2019s phantasy, depict, as is natural, those traits of character which belong to the author. The hero, the wish figure, is represented as most distinguished, because the hero always combines in himself all wished-for ideals. Cyrano\u2019s attitude is certainly beautiful and impressive; Cassius\u2019s behavior has a theatrical effect. Both heroes prepare to die effectively, in which attempt Cyrano succeeds. This attitude betrays a wish for death in the unconscious of our author, the meaning of which we have already discussed at length as the motive for her poem of the moth. The wish of young girls to die is only an indirect expression, which remains a pose, even in case of real death, for death itself can be a pose. Such an outcome merely adds beauty and value to the pose under certain conditions. That the highest summit of life is expressed through the symbolism of death is a well-known fact; for creation beyond one\u2019s self means personal death. The coming generation is the end of the preceding one. This symbolism is frequent in erotic speech. The lascivious speech between Lucius and the wanton servant-maid in Apuleius (\u201cMetamorphoses,\u201d lib. ii: 32) is one of the clearest examples:\u201cProeliare, inquit, et fortiter proeliare: nec enim tibi cedam, nec  terga vortam. Cominus in aspectum, si vir es, dirige; et grassare  naviter, et occide moriturus. Hodierna pugna non habet  missionem.\u2014Simul ambo corruimus inter mutuos amplexus animas  anhelantes.\u201d[598]",

    "question": "Provide an example from the text to illustrate the symbolism of death in erotic speech.",
    "answer": "An example from the text illustrating the symbolism of death in erotic speech comes from the interaction between Lucius and a wanton servant-maid in Apuleius' \"Metamorphoses,\" where Lucius says, \"Fight, and fight bravely: for I will not yield to you, nor turn my back. Come at me at once if you are a man, and fight like a hero, and die like a gladiator. Today's battle has no turning back.\" This exchange highlights the symbolic use of death in an erotic context.",
