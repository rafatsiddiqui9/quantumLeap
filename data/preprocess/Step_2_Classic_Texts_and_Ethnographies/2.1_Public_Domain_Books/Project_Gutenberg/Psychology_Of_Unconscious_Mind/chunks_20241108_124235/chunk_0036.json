When we repaired to the rock for rest,\n  then verily I forgot the fish; and none but Satan made me forget it,\n  so as not to mention it; and it hath taken its way in the sea in a\n  wondrous sort.’\n\n  “He said, ‘It is this we were in quest of.’ So they both went back\n  retracing their footsteps.\n\n  “Then found they one of our servants to whom we had vouchsafed our\n  mercy, and whom we had instructed with our knowledge;[369]\n\n  “Moses said to him, ‘Shall I follow thee that thou teach me, for\n  guidance of that which thou hast been taught?’\n\n  “He said, ‘Verily, thou canst by no means have patience with me; and\n  how canst thou be patient in matters whose meaning thou comprehendest\n  not?’”—Trans. Rodwell, page 188.\n\nMoses now accompanies the mysterious servant of God, who does divers\nthings which Moses cannot comprehend; finally, the Unknown takes leave\nof Moses, and speaks to him as follows:\n\n  “They will ask thee of Dhoulkarnein (the two-horned).[370] Say: ‘I\n  will recite to you an account of him.’\n\n  “Verily, we established his power upon the earth and we gave him a\n  means to accomplish every end, so he followed his way;\n\n  “Until when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it to set in a\n  miry forest; and hard by, he found a people....”\n\nNow follows a moral reflection; then the narrative continues:\n\n  “Then he followed his course further until he came to the place where\n  the sun rises....”\n\nIf now we wish to know who is the unknown servant of God, we are told in\nthis passage _he is Dhulqarnein, Alexander, the Sun; he goes to the\nplace of setting and he goes to the place of rising_. The passage about\nthe unknown servant of God is explained by the commentaries in a\nwell-defined legend. The servant is Chidher, “the verdant one,” the\nnever-tiring wanderer, who roams for hundreds and thousands of years\nover lands and seas, the teacher and counsellor of pious men; the one\nwise in divine knowledge—the immortal.[371] The authority of the Tabari\nassociates Chidher with Dhulqarnein; Chidher is said to have reached the\n“stream of life” as a follower of Alexander, and both unwittingly had\ndrunk of it, so that they became immortal. Moreover, _Chidher is\nidentified by the old commentators with Elias_, who also did not die,\nbut _who was taken to Heaven in a fiery chariot_. Elias is\n_Helios_.[372] It is to be observed that Ahasver also owes his existence\nto an obscure place in the holy Christian scriptures. This place is to\nbe found in Matthew xvi:28. First comes the scene where Christ appoints\nPeter as the rock of his church, and nominates him the governor of his\npower.[373] After that follows the prophecy of his death, and then comes\nthe passage:\n\n  “Verily, I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not\n  taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”\n\nHere follows the scene of the transfiguration:\n\n  “And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,\n  and his raiment was white as the light.\n\n  “And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.\n\n  “Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to\n  be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for\n  thee and one for Moses and one for Elias.’”[374]\n\nFrom these passages it appears that Christ stands on the same plane as\nElias, without being identified with him,[375] although the people\nconsider him as Elias. The ascension places Christ as identical with\nElias. The prophecy of Christ shows that there exist aside from himself\none or more immortals who shall not die until Parousai. According to\nJohn xxi: 22nd verse, the boy John was considered as one of these\nimmortals, and in the legend he is, in fact, not dead but merely\nsleeping in the ground until Parousai, and breathes so that the dust\nswirls round his grave.[376] As is evident, there are passable bridges\nfrom Christ by way of Elias to Chidher and Ahasuerus. It is said in an\naccount of this legend[377] that Dhulqarnein led his friend Chidher to\nthe “source of life” in order to have him drink of immortality.[378]\nAlexander also bathed in the stream of life and performed the ritual\nablutions. As I previously mentioned in a footnote, according to Matthew\nxvii: 12th verse, John the Baptist is Elias, therefore primarily\nidentical with Chidher. Now, however, it is to be noted that in the\nArabian legend Chidher appears rather as a companion or accompanied\n(Chidher with Dhulqarnein or with Elias, “like unto them”; or identified\nwith them[379]). There are therefore, two similar figures who resemble\neach other, but who, nevertheless, are distinct. The analogous situation\nin the Christian legend is found in the scene by the Jordan where John\nleads Christ to the “source of life.” Christ is there, the subordinate,\nJohn the superior, similar to Dhulqarnein and Chidher, or Chidher and\nMoses, also Elias. The latter relation especially is such that Vollers\ncompares Chidher and Elias, on the one side, with Gilgamesh and his\nmortal brother Eabani; on the other side, with the Dioscuri, one of whom\nis immortal, the other mortal. This relation is also found in Christ and\nJohn the Baptist,[380] on the one hand, and Christ and Peter, on the\nother. The last-named parallel only finds its explanation through\ncomparison with the Mithraic mysteries, where the esoteric contents are\nrevealed to us through monuments. Upon the Mithraic marble relief of\nKlagenfurt[381] it is represented how with a halo Mithra crowns Helios,\nwho either kneels before him or else floats up to him from below. Mithra\nis represented on a Mithraic monument of Osterburken as holding in his\nright hand the shoulder of the mystic ox above Helios, who stands bowed\ndown before him, the left hand resting on a sword hilt. A crown lies\nbetween them on the ground. Cumont observes about this scene that it\nprobably represents the divine prototype of the ceremony of the\ninitiation into the degree of Miles, in which a sword and a crown were\nconferred upon the mystic. Helios is, therefore, appointed the Miles of\nMithra. In a general way, Mithra seems to occupy the rôle of patron to\nHelios, which reminds us of the boldness of Hercules towards Helios.\nUpon his journey towards Geryon, Helios burns too hotly; Hercules, full\nof anger, threatens him with his never-failing arrows. Therefore, Helios\nis compelled to yield, and lends to the hero his Sun ship, with which he\nwas accustomed to journey across the sea. Thus Hercules returns to\nErythia, to the cattle herds of Geryon.[382] On the monument at\nKlagenfurt, Mithra is furthermore represented pressing Helios’s hand,\neither in farewell or as a ratification. In a further scene Mithra\nmounts the Chariot of Helios, either for the ascension or the “Sea\nJourney.”[383] Cumont is of the opinion that Mithra gives to Helios a\nsort of ceremonious investiture and consecrates him with his divine\npower by crowning him with his own hands. This relation corresponds to\nthat of Christ to Peter. Peter, through his symbol, the cock, has the\ncharacter of a sun-god. After the ascension (or sea journey) of Christ,\nhe is the visible pontiff of the divinity; he suffers, therefore, the\nsame death (crucifixion) as Christ, and becomes the great Roman deity\n(_Sol invictus_), the conquering, triumphant Church itself, embodied in\nthe Pope. In the scene of Malchus he is always shown as the miles of\nChrist, to whom the sword is granted, and as the rock upon which the\nChurch is founded. The crown[384] is also given to him who possesses the\npower to bind and to set free. Thus, Christ, like the Sun, is the\nvisible God, whereas the Pope, like the heir of the Roman Cæsars, is\n_solis invicti comes_. The setting sun appoints a successor whom he\ninvests with the power of the sun.[385] Dhulqarnein gives Chidher\neternal life. Chidher communicates his wisdom to Moses.[386] There even\nexists a report according to which the forgetful servant of Joshua\ndrinks from the well of life, whereupon he becomes immortal, and is\nplaced in a ship by Chidher and Moses, as a punishment, and is cast out\nto sea, once more a fragment of a sun myth, the motive of the “sea\njourney.”[387]\n\nThe primitive symbol, which designates that portion of the Zodiac in\nwhich the Sun, with the Winter Solstice, again enters upon the yearly\ncourse, is the goat, fish sign, the αἰγωκέρως. The Sun mounts like a\ngoat to the highest mountain, and later goes into the water as a fish.\nThe fish is the symbol of the child,[388] for the child before his birth\nlives in the water like a fish, and the Sun, because it plunges into the\nsea, becomes equally child and fish. The fish, however, is also a\nphallic symbol,[389] also a symbol for the woman.[390] Briefly stated,\nthe fish is a libido symbol, and, indeed, as it seems predominately _for\nthe renewal of the libido_.\n\nThe journey of Moses with his servant is a life-journey (eighty years).\nThey grow old and lose their life force (libido), that is, they lose the\nfish which “pursues its course in a marvellous manner to the sea,” which\nmeans the setting of the sun. When the two notice their loss, they\ndiscover at the place where the “source of life” is found (where the\ndead fish revived and sprang into the sea) Chidher wrapped in his\nmantle,[391] sitting on the ground. According to another version, he sat\non an island in the sea, or “in the wettest place on earth,” that is, he\nwas just _born from the maternal depths_. Where the fish vanished\nChidher, “the verdant one,” was born as a “son of the deep waters,” his\nhead veiled, a Cabir, a proclaimer of divine wisdom; the old Babylonian\nOannes-Ea, who was represented in the form of a fish, and daily came\nfrom the sea as a fish to teach the people wisdom.[392] His name was\nbrought into connection with John’s. With the rising of the renewed sun\nall that lived in darkness, as water-animal or fish, surrounded by all\nterrors of night and death,[393] became as the shining fiery firmament\nof the day. Thus the words of John the Baptist[394] gain especial\nmeaning:\n\n  “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh\n  after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he\n  shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”\n\nWith Vollers we may also compare Chidher and Elias (Moses and his\nservant Joshua) with Gilgamesh and his brother Eabani. Gilgamesh\nwandered through the world, driven by anxiety and longing, to find\nimmortality. His path led him across the seas to the wise Utnapishtim\n(Noah), who knew how to cross the waters of death. There Gilgamesh had\nto dive down to the bottom of the sea for the magical herb which was to\nlead him back to the land of men. When he had come again to his native\nland a serpent stole the magic plant from him (the fish again slid into\nthe sea). But on the return from the land of the blessed an immortal\nmariner accompanied him, who, banished by a curse of Utnapishtim, was\nforbidden to return to the land of the blessed. Gilgamesh’s journey had\nlost its purpose on account of the loss of the magic herb; instead he is\naccompanied by an immortal, whose fate, indeed, we cannot learn from the\nfragments of the epic. This banished immortal is the model for Ahasver,\nas Jensen[395] aptly remarked.\n\nAgain we encounter the motive of the Dioscuri, mortal and immortal,\nsetting and rising sun. This _motive is also represented as if projected\nfrom the hero_.",
