    "paragraph": "\u201cIn truth, he (\u00c2tman)[310] was as large as a woman and a man, when  they embrace each other. This, his own self, he divided into two  parts, out of which husband and wife were formed.[311] With her, he  copulated; from this humanity sprang. She, however, pondered: \u2018How may  he unite with me after he has created me from himself? Now I shall  hide!\u2019 Then she became a cow; he, however, became a bull and mated  with her. From that sprang the horned cattle. Then she became a mare;  he, however, became a stallion; she became a she-ass; he, an ass, and  mated with her. From these sprang the whole-hoofed animals. She became  a goat; he became a buck; she became an ewe; he became a ram, and  mated with her. Thus were created goats and sheep. Thus it happened  that all that mates, even down to the ants, he created\u2014then he  perceived: \u2018Truly I myself am Creation, for I have created the whole  world!\u2019 Thereupon he rubbed his hands (held before the mouth) so that  he brought forth fire from his mouth, as from the mother womb, and  from his hands.\u201dThe mouth has, as we saw, a further important function, which has just as much sexual relation to the object as the hand, that is to say, the production of the mating call. In opening up the autoerotic ring (hand-mouth),[319] where the phallic hand became the fire-producing tool, the libido which was directed to the mouth zone was obliged to seek another path of functioning, which naturally was found in the already existing love call. The excess of libido entering here must have had the usual results, namely, the stimulation of the newly possessed function; hence an elaboration of the mating call.",
