    "paragraph": "It may be assumed most certainly that the domestication of humanity has cost the greatest sacrifices. An age which produced the stoical ideal must certainly have known why and against what it was created. The age of Nero serves to set off effectually the famous extracts from the forty-first letter of Seneca to Lucilius:\u201cOne drags the other into error, and how can we attain to salvation  when no one bids us halt, when all the world drives us in deeper?\u201d\u201cDo you ever come across a man unafraid in danger, untouched by  desires, happy in misfortune, peaceful in the midst of a storm,  elevated above ordinary mortals, on the same plane as the gods, does  not reverence seize you? Are you not compelled to say, \u2018Such an  exalted being is certainly something different from the miserable body  which he inhabits?\u2019 A divine strength rules there, such an excellent  mind, full of moderation, raised above all trivialities, which smiles  at that which we others fear or strive after: a heavenly power  animates such a person, a thing of this kind does not exist without  the co\u00f6peration of a deity. The largest part of such a being belongs  to the region from which he came. Just as the sun\u2019s rays touch the  earth in reality and yet are at home only there from whence they come,  so an eminent holy man associates with us. He is sent to us that we  may learn to know the divine better, and although with us, still  really belongs to his original home. He looks thither and reaches  towards it; among us he walks as an exalted being.\u201d",

    "question": "According to the passage, what does Seneca say about the nature of an individual who embodies the Stoic ideal?",
    "answer": "Seneca describes an individual who embodies the Stoic ideal as unafraid in danger, untouched by desires, happy in misfortune, peaceful in storms, elevated above ordinary mortals, and on the same plane as the gods. Seneca notes that this individual's demeanor and strength suggest a divine presence, indicating that such a person is a being different from the \"miserable body\" they inhabit.",
