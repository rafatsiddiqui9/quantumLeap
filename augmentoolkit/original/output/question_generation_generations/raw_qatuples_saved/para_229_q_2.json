    "paragraph": "\u201cAye, thou art far away, O holy countenance! And the melody of thy life is kept from me, No longer overheard. And, ah, where are Thy magic songs which once soothed my heart With the peace of Heaven? How long it is, how long! The youth is aged; the very earth itself, which once smiled on me, Has grown different.\u201cOh, farewell! The soul of every day departs, and, departing, turns to   thee\u2014 And over thee there weeps The eye that, becoming brighter, Looks down, There where thou tarriest.\u201dThis distinctly suggests a renunciation, an envy of one\u2019s own youth, that time of freedom which one would like to retain through a deep-rooted dislike to all duty and endeavor which is denied an immediate pleasure reward. Painstaking work for a long time and for a remote object is not in the nature of child or primitive man. It is difficult to say if this can really be called laziness, but it seems to have not a little in common with it, in so far as the psychic life on a primitive stage, be it of an infantile or archaic type, possesses an extreme inertia and irresponsibility in production and non-production.The last stanza portends evil, a gazing towards the other land, the distant coast of sunrise or sunset; love no longer holds the poet, the bonds with the world are torn and he calls loudly for assistance to the mother:_Achilles._",

    "question": "How does the speaker describe the relationship between youth and effort, and what does this suggest about their perspective on work and responsibility?\n\n**ANS:****\nThe speaker describes youth as a time of freedom, characterized by a lack of duty and effort, and contrasts it with the current state of aging and a growing sense of responsibility. This suggests that the speaker views work and responsibility as difficult and distant from immediate pleasure, indicating a perspective that aligns with a dislike for prolonged, effortful tasks without immediate rewards.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do the last stanza and the mention of \"Achilles\" imply about the speaker's state of mind and their future outlook?",
    "answer": "The last stanza implies a sense of evanescence, with the speaker gazing towards a distant land, possibly a state of detachment or longing for the unknown. The mention of \"Achilles\" suggests a call for help or a desire for assistance, indicating that the speaker is feeling lonely and in need of support. This implies a future outlook of seeking comfort or guidance, possibly from a maternal figure, as the bonds with the world are being torn.",
