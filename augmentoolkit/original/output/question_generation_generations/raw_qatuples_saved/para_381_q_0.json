    "paragraph": "After this vision, Miss Miller felt that a name formed itself \u201cbit by bit,\u201d which seemed to belong to this Aztec\u2014\u201cthe son of an Inca of Peru.\u201d The name is \u201cChi-wan-to-pel.\u201d As the author intimated, something similar to this belonged to her childish reminiscences. The act of naming is, like baptism, something exceedingly important for the creation of a personality, because, since olden times, a magic power has been attributed to the name, with which, for example, the spirit of the dead can be conjured. To know the name of any one means, in mythology, to have power over that one. As a well-known example I mention the fairy tale of \u201cRumpelstilzchen.\u201d In an Egyptian myth, Isis robs the Sun god R\u00ea permanently of his power by compelling him to tell her his real name.

Although one might hesitate to consider this unhallowed joke as of psychologic importance, still one must inquire for the reason of its being. One must also put, as a counter question, Why is it always Popocatepetl and not the neighboring Iztaccihuatl, or the even higher and just as clear Orizaba? The last has certainly the more beautiful and more easily pronounced name. Popocatepetl is impressive because of its onomatopoetic name. In English the word is \u201cto pop\u201d (popgun), which is here considered as onomatopoesy; in German the words are _Hinterpommern_, _Pumpernickel_; _Bombe_; _Petarde_ (_le pet_ = flatus).

    "question": "What is the significance of the act of naming in the context of creating a personality, according to the text?",
    "answer": "The act of naming is exceedingly important for the creation of a personality because, since olden times, a magic power has been attributed to names. Knowing a name means having power over that person, as seen in various mythological examples such as the fairy tale of \"Rumpelstilzchen\" and the Egyptian myth where Isis gains power over the Sun god R\u0113 by knowing his true name. Thus, naming someone or something invests them with a definite personality.",
