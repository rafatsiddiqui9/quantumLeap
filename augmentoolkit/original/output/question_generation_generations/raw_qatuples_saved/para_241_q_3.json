    "paragraph": "\u201cAfter a long and rough journey from New York to Stockholm, from there  to Petersburg and Odessa, I found it a true pleasure[60] to leave the  world of inhabited cities\u2014and to enter the world of waves, sky and  silence\u2014I stayed hours long on deck to dream, stretched out in a  reclining chair. The histories, legends and myths of the different  countries which I saw in the distance, came back to me indistinctly  blended together in a sort of luminous mist, in which things lost  their reality, while the dreams and thoughts alone took on somewhat  the appearance of reality. At first, I even avoided all company and  kept to myself, lost wholly in my dreams, where all that I knew of  great, beautiful and good came back into my consciousness with new  strength and new life. I also employed a great part of my time writing  to my distant friends, reading and sketching out short poems about the  regions visited. Some of these poems were of a very serious  character.\u201dIt may seem superfluous, perhaps, to enter intimately into all these details. If we recall, however, the remark made above,\u2014that when people let their unconscious speak, they always tell us the most important things of their intimate selves\u2014then even the smallest detail appears to have meaning. Valuable personalities invariably tell us, through their unconscious, things that are generally valuable, so that patient interest is rewarded.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the smallest details in the individual's account of the journey?",
    "answer": "Even the smallest details in the individual's account of the journey are significant. If we recall that when people let their unconscious speak, they reveal the most important things about themselves, then every detail, no matter how small, has meaning. Valuable personalities often reveal important information through their unconscious, making patient interest in such details rewarding.",
