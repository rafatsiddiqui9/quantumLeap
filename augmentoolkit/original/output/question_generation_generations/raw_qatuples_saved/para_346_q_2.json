    "paragraph": "If we place fire and gold as essentially similar, then a great accord is found in the attributes of the two gods. To these mystical pagan ideas there deserve to be added the probably almost contemporaneous vision of Revelation:\u201cAnd being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And in the midst  of the candlesticks[162] one like unto the son of man, clothed with a  garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden  girdle. And his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as  snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire. And his feet like unto  burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice  as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven  stars,[163] and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged  sword,[164] and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his  strength.\u201d\u2014_Rev._ i: 12 ff.\u201cAnd I looked, and beheld a white cloud, and upon the cloud I saw one  sitting like unto the son of man, having on his head a golden crown,  and in his hand a sharp sickle.\u201d[165]\u2014_Rev._ xiv: 14.\u201cAnd his eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon his head were many  diadems. And he was arrayed in a garment[166] sprinkled with blood....  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,  clothed in fine linen,[167] white and pure. And out of his mouth  proceeded a sharp sword.\u201d\u2014_Rev._ xix: 12\u201315.",

    "question": "What are the descriptors used in Revelation 1:12 ff. that could be metaphorically linked to fire and gold?",
    "answer": "In Revelation 1:12 ff., the figure is described as having hair white as white wool and white as snow, which can be metaphorically linked to the purity and brilliance of both fire and gold. Additionally, the figure is clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle, which emphasizes the value and majesty associated with gold.",
