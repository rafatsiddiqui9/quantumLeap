    "paragraph": "It affords me especial satisfaction that our teacher also, when he laid his hand on the delicate material of the paranoic psychology, was forced to doubt the applicability of the conception of libido held by him at that time. The sexual definition of this did not permit me to understand those disturbances of function, which affect the vague territory of the hunger instinct just as much as that of the sexual instinct. For a long time the theory of libido seemed to me inapplicable to dementia pr\u00e6cox. With increasing experience in analytical work, however, I became aware of a gradual change in my conception of libido. In place of the descriptive definition of the \u201cThree Contributions\u201d there gradually grew up a generic definition of the libido, which rendered it possible for me to replace the expression \u201cpsychic energy\u201d by the term \u201clibido.\u201d I was forced to ask myself whether indeed the function of reality to-day does not consist only in its smaller part of libido sexualis and in the greater part of other impulses? It is still a very important question whether phylogenetically the function of reality is not, at least in great part, of sexual origin. To answer this question directly in regard to the function of reality is not possible, but we shall attempt to come to an understanding indirectly.\u201cWhat lies enclosed in the intellect, comes to development in the  world-soul as logos, fills it with meaning and makes it as if  intoxicated with nectar.\u201d[262]Nectar is analogous to soma, the drink of fertility and of life, also to sperma. The soul is fructified by the intellect; as oversoul it is called heavenly Aphrodite, as the undersoul the earthly Aphrodite. \u201cIt knows the birth pangs,\u201d[263] and so on. The bird of Aphrodite, the dove, is not without good cause the symbol of the Holy Ghost.",

    "question": "How did the author's understanding of libido evolve over time?",
    "answer": "The author initially found the sexual definition of libido inadequate for understanding disturbances of function affecting both the hunger and sexual instincts. Over time, as the author gained more experience in analytical work, their conception of libido evolved from a sexual definition to a more generic one. This allowed the author to replace the term \"psychic energy\" with \"libido.\" The author also began to question whether the function of reality might be more dominated by other impulses than by libido sexualis.",
