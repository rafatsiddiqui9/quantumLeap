    "paragraph": "Self-concentration and the strength derived therefrom correspond to this primitive train of thought. It also explains numerous sacrificial and magic rites which we have already fully discussed. Thus the impregnable Troy falls because the besiegers creep into the belly of a wooden horse; for he alone is a hero who is reborn from the mother, like the sun. But the danger of this venture is shown by the history of Philoctetes, who was the only one in the Trojan expedition who knew the hidden sanctuary of Chryse, where the Argonauts had sacrificed already, and where the Greeks planned to sacrifice in order to assure a safe ending to their undertaking. Chryse was a nymph upon the island of Chryse; according to the account of the scholiasts in Sophocles\u2019s \u201cPhiloctetes,\u201d this nymph loved Philoctetes, and cursed him because he spurned her love. This characteristic projection, which is also met with in the Gilgamesh epic, should be referred back, as suggested, to the repressed incest wish of the son, who is represented through the projection as if the mother had the evil wish, for the refusal of which the son was given over to death. In reality, however, the son becomes mortal by separating himself from the mother. His fear of death, therefore, corresponds to the repressed wish to turn back to the mother, and causes him to believe that the mother threatens or pursues him. The teleological significance of this _fear of persecution_ is evident; _it is to keep son and mother apart_.The curse of Chryse is realized in so far that Philoctetes, according to one version, when approaching his altar, injured himself in his foot with one of his own deadly poisonous arrows, or, according to another version[612] (this is better and far more abundantly proven), _was bitten in his foot by a poisonous serpent_.[613] From then on he is ailing.[614]",

    "question": "How does the story of Philoctetes illustrate the concept of the repressed incest wish of the son?\n\n**ANS:** Philoctetes, the only one in the Trojan expedition who knew the hidden sanctuary of Chryse, where the Argonauts had sacrificed and where the Greeks planned to sacrifice, represents a projection of the repressed incest wish of the son. The nymph Chryse, who loved Philoctetes and cursed him for spurning her love, is a symbol of the mother figure. This projection suggests that the son sees the mother as having the evil wish, which leads to his fear and belief that she threatens or pursues him.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat happens to Philoctetes according to the different versions of the story, and how does this relate to the concept of the fear of persecution?",
    "answer": "According to one version, Philoctetes injures himself in his foot with one of his own deadly poisonous arrows when approaching his altar. In another version, which is better and more extensively proven, Philoctetes is bitten in his foot by a poisonous serpent. This foot injury or bite symbolizes the realization of the curse of Chryse, and it causes Philoctetes to become ailing. This relates to the concept of the fear of persecution, as it keeps the son and mother apart, reflecting the son's fear of returning to the mother.",
