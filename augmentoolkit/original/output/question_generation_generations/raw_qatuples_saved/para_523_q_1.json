In fact, representations of the mystic basket are given, wherein lies a phallus surrounded by fruits.[672] Upon the so-called Lovatelli tomb vase, the sculptures of which are understood to be Eleusinian ceremonies, it is shown how a mystic caressed the serpent entwining Demeter. The caressing of the fear animal indicates a religious conquering of incest.[673] According to the testimony of Clemens of Alexandria, a serpent was in the chest. The serpent in this connection is naturally of phallic nature, the phallus which is forbidden in relation to the mother. Rohde mentions that in the Arrhetophories, pastry, in the form of phalli and serpents, were thrown into the cave near the Thesmophorion. This custom was a petition for the bestowal of children and harvest.[674] The snake also plays a large part in initiations under the remarkable title \u1f41 \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.[675] Clemens observes that the symbol of the Sabazios mysteries is \u1f41 \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f57\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03bb\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd.[676]Through Arnobius we learn:\u201cAureus coluber in sinum demittitur consecratis et eximitur rursus ab  inferioribus partibus atque imis.\u201d[677]",
