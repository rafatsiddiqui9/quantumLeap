    "paragraph": "\u201cAye, thou art far away, O holy countenance! And the melody of thy life is kept from me, No longer overheard. And, ah, where are Thy magic songs which once soothed my heart With the peace of Heaven? How long it is, how long! The youth is aged; the very earth itself, which once smiled on me, Has grown different.\u201cOh, farewell! The soul of every day departs, and, departing, turns to   thee\u2014 And over thee there weeps The eye that, becoming brighter, Looks down, There where thou tarriest.\u201dThis distinctly suggests a renunciation, an envy of one\u2019s own youth, that time of freedom which one would like to retain through a deep-rooted dislike to all duty and endeavor which is denied an immediate pleasure reward. Painstaking work for a long time and for a remote object is not in the nature of child or primitive man. It is difficult to say if this can really be called laziness, but it seems to have not a little in common with it, in so far as the psychic life on a primitive stage, be it of an infantile or archaic type, possesses an extreme inertia and irresponsibility in production and non-production.The last stanza portends evil, a gazing towards the other land, the distant coast of sunrise or sunset; love no longer holds the poet, the bonds with the world are torn and he calls loudly for assistance to the mother:_Achilles._",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the nature of work and effort in relation to child or primitive man?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that work and effort, especially for a long time and for a remote object, are not natural to a child or primitive man. These individuals seek immediate pleasure and are less inclined to engage in painstaking work for distant rewards. This implies that work and effort are more challenging to instill and maintain, as they are not part of the inherent nature of such individuals, who tend to have a high inertia and irresponsibility in their actions.",
