The Oedipus problem has also been used in philosophy to explore the nature of truth and knowledge. It raises questions about the relationship between language and reality, and the limits of human understanding.

For example, if a statement is true, then it must correspond to some fact or reality. But if a statement is about its own truth or falsity, then it is impossible to determine whether it is true or false. This creates a problem for any theory of truth that relies on the idea that truth is a matter of correspondence to reality.
