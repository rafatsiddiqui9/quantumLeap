    "paragraph": "We see again in this little myth the typical constituents of the libido myth: original bisexuality, immortality (invulnerability) through entrance into the mother (splitting the mother with the foot, and to become covered up) and resurrection as a bird of the soul and a bringer of fertility (ascending sun). When this type of hero causes his lance to be worshipped, it probably means that his lance is a valid and equivalent expression of himself.From our present standpoint, we understand in a new sense that passage in Job, which I mentioned in Chapter IV of the first part of this book:\u201cHe has set me up for his mark.\u201cHis archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and  doth not spare:\u2014he poureth out my gall upon the ground.\u201cHe breaketh me with breach upon breach: he runneth upon me like a  giant.\u201d\u2014_Job_ xvi:12\u201313\u201314.Now we understand this symbolism as an expression for the soul torment caused by the onslaught of the unconscious desires. The libido festers in his flesh, a cruel god has taken possession of him and pierced him with his painful libidian projectiles, with thoughts, which overwhelmingly pass through him. (As a dementia pr\u00e6cox patient once said to me during his recovery: \u201cTo-day a thought suddenly thrust itself through me.\u201d) This same idea is found again in Nietzsche in Zarathustra:_The Magician_",
