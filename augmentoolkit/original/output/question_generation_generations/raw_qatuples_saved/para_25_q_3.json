    "paragraph": " Thus man can remain a child for all time and satisfy his incest wish all unawares. This state would doubtless be ideal[464] if it were not infantile and, therefore, merely a one-sided wish, which maintains a childish attitude. _The reverse is anxiety._ Much is said of pious people who remain unshaken in their trust in God and wander unswervingly safe and blessed through the world. I have never seen this Chidher yet. It is probably a wish figure. The rule is great uncertainty among believers, which they drown with fanatical cries among themselves or among others; moreover, they have religious doubts, moral uncertainty, doubts of their own personality, feelings of guilt and, deepest of all, great fear of the opposite aspect of reality, against which the most highly intelligent people struggle with all their force. This other side is the devil, the adversary or, expressed in modern terms, the corrective of reality, of the infantile world picture, which has been made acceptable through the predominating pleasure principle.[465] But the world is not a garden of God, of the Father, but a place of terrors. Not only is heaven no father and earth no mother and the people not brothers nor sisters, but they represent hostile, destroying powers, to which we are abandoned the more surely, the more childishly and thoughtlessly we have entrusted ourselves to the so-called Fatherly hand of God. One should never forget the harsh speech of the first Napoleon, that the good God is always on the side of the heaviest artillery.",

    "question": "How does the text portray the relationship between humans and the world as described by the first Napoleon?",
    "answer": "The text portrays the relationship between humans and the world as described by the first Napoleon in a critical light, suggesting that heaven is not a father, earth is not a mother, and people are not brothers or sisters. Instead, the world is described as a place of terrors, where hostile and destructive powers prevail, to which we are abandoned the more we trust in a so-called \"Fatherly hand of God.\" This portrayal highlights the contrast between the idealized and the harsh reality.",
