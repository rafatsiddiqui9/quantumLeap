    "paragraph": "Here we have a richly developed phantasy system before us. It is concerned with the subtle and perpetually undecided question as to whether the legendary figure of Judas is damned or not. The Judas legend is, in itself, mythical material, viz., the malicious betrayal of a hero. I recall Siegfried and Hagen, Balder and Loki. Siegfried and Balder were murdered by a faithless traitor from among their closest associates. This myth is moving and tragic\u2014it is not honorable battle which kills the noble, but evil treachery. It is, too, an occurrence which is historical over and over again. One thinks of C\u00e6sar and Brutus. Since the myth of such a deed is very old, and still the subject of teaching and repetition, it is the expression of a psychological fact, that envy does not allow humanity to sleep, and that all of us carry, in a hidden recess of our heart, a deadly wish towards the hero. This rule can be applied generally to mythical tradition. _It does not set forth any account of the old events, but rather acts in such a way that it always reveals a thought common to humanity, and once more rejuvenated._ Thus, for example, the lives and deeds of the founders of old religions are the purest condensations of typical, contemporaneous myths, behind which the individual figure entirely disappears.[54]But why does our pious Abb\u00e9 torment himself with the old Judas legend? He first went into the world to preach the gospel of mercy, and then, after some time, he separated from the Catholic church and became a Swedenborgian. Now we understand his Judas phantasy. _He was the Judas_ who betrayed his Lord. Therefore, first of all, he had to make sure of the divine mercy, in order to be Judas in peace.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the Judas legend in the context of the pious Abb\u00e9's actions?",
    "answer": "The Judas legend is significant in the context of the pious Abb\u00e9's actions because he first preached the gospel of mercy and then separated from the Catholic church to become a Swedenborgian. The author interprets this as the Abb\u00e9 seeing himself as Judas, who betrayed his Lord. Therefore, the Abb\u00e9 had to seek divine mercy to find peace with his actions, suggesting that he was tormented by the idea of being a betrayer.",
