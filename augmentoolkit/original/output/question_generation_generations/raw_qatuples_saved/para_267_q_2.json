    "paragraph": "We have already seen that the horse is connected through Ygdrasil with the symbolism of the tree. The horse is also a \u201ctree of death\u201d; thus in the Middle Ages the funeral pyre was called St. Michael\u2019s horse, and the neo-Persian word for coffin means \u201cwooden horse.\u201d[596] The horse has also the r\u00f4le of psycho-pompos; he is the steed to conduct the souls to the other world\u2014horsewomen fetch the souls (Valkyries). Neo-Greek songs represent Charon on a horse. These definitions obviously lead to the mother symbolism. The Trojan horse was the only means by which the city could be conquered; because only he who has entered the mother and been reborn is an invincible hero. The Trojan horse is a magic charm, like the \u201cNodfyr,\u201d which also serves to overcome necessity. The formula evidently reads, \u201cIn order to overcome the difficulty, thou must commit incest, and once more be born from thy mother.\u201d It appears that striking a nail into the sacred tree signifies something very similar. The \u201cStock im Eisen\u201d in Vienna seems to have been such a palladium.Still another symbolic form is to be considered. Occasionally the devil rides upon a three-legged horse. The Goddess of Death, Hel, in time of pestilence, also rides upon a three-legged horse.[597] The gigantic ass, which is three-legged, stands in the heavenly rain lake Vourukasha; his urine purifies the water of the lake, and from his roar all useful animals become pregnant and all harmful animals miscarry. The Triad further points to the phallic significance. The contrasting symbolism of Hel is blended into one conception in the ass of Vourukasha. The libido is fructifying as well as destroying.",
