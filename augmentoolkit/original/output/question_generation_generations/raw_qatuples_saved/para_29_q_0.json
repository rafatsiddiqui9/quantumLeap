    "paragraph": "The Logos became a cow; that is to say, the mother, who is pregnant with the gods. (In Christian uncanonical phantasies, where the Holy Ghost has feminine significance, we have the well-known motive of the two mothers, the earthly mother, Mary, and the spiritual mother, the Holy Ghost.) The transformation of the Logos into the mother is not remarkable in itself, because the origin of the phenomenon fire-speech seems to be the mother-libido, according to the discussion in the earlier chapter.

This is not surprising because, as discussed earlier, the origin of the phenomenon of fire-speech is linked to the mother-libido, indicating that the spiritual can be understood as the mother-libido.",
