    "paragraph": "The hero is himself a serpent, himself a sacrificer and a sacrificed. The hero himself is of _serpent nature_; therefore, Christ compares himself with the serpent; therefore, the redeeming principle of the world of that Gnostic sect which styled itself the Ophite was the serpent. The serpent is the Agatho and Kako demon. It is, indeed, intelligible, when, in the Germanic saga, they say that the heroes had serpents\u2019 eyes.[770] I recall the parallel previously drawn between the eyes of the Son of man and those of the Tarpeian dragon. In the already mentioned medi\u00e6val pictures, the dragon, instead of the Lord, appeared in the cup; the dragon who with changeful, serpent glances[771] guarded the divine mystery of renewed rebirth in the maternal womb. In Nietzsche the old, apparently long extinct idea is again revived:[772]\u201cAiling with tenderness, just as the thawing wind,      Zarathustra sits waiting, waiting on his hill,      Sweetened and cooked in his own juice,      Beneath his summits,      Beneath his ice he sits,      Weary and happy,      A Creator on his seventh day.      Silence!      It is my truth!      From hesitating eyes\u2014      From velvety shadows      Her glance meets mine,      Lovely, mischievous, the glance of a girl.      She divines the reason of my happiness,      She divines me\u2014ha! what is she plotting?      A purple dragon lurks      In the abyss of her maiden glance.[773]      Woe to thee, Zarathustra,      Thou seemest like some one      Who has swallowed gold,      Thy belly will be slit open.\u201d[774]",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the nature of the hero and Christ in relation to the serpent?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that the hero and Christ both embody serpent nature, leading to the comparison of Christ with the serpent. This implies that the serpent is a central and significant figure in both the hero's and Christ's narratives.",
