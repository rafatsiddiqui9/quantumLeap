    "paragraph": "The retrospective longing acts like a paralyzing poison upon the energy and enterprise; so that it may well be compared to a poisonous serpent which lies across our path. Apparently, it is a hostile demon which robs us of energy, but, in reality, it is the individual unconscious, the retrogressive tendency of which begins to overcome the conscious forward striving. The cause of this can be, for example, the natural aging which weakens the energy, or it may be great external difficulties, which cause man to break down and become a child again, or it may be, and this is probably the most frequent cause, the woman who enslaves the man, so that he can no longer free himself, and becomes a child again.[618] It may be of significance also that Isis, as sister-wife of the sun-god, creates the poisonous animal from the spittle of the god, which is perhaps a substitute for sperma, and, therefore, is a symbol of libido. She creates the animal from the libido of the god; that means she receives his power, making him weak and dependent, so that by this means she assumes the dominating r\u00f4le of the mother. (Mother transference to the wife.) This part is preserved in the legend of Samson, in the r\u00f4le of Delilah, who cut off Samson\u2019s hair, the sun\u2019s rays, thus robbing him of his strength.[619] Any weakening of the adult man strengthens the wishes of the unconscious; therefore, the decrease of strength appears directly as the backward striving towards the mother.",

    "question": "How might the mythological figure Isis symbolize the concept of the unconscious enslaving the conscious?\n\n**ANSIS:**\nIn the mythological context, Isis, as the sister-wife of the sun-god, creates a poisonous animal from the spittle of the god, which could symbolize the libido or the god's power. By receiving this power, Isis makes the god weak and dependent, thereby assuming the dominating role of the mother. This can be seen as a metaphor for the unconscious (symbolized by Isis) enslaving the conscious (symbolized by the sun-god) and causing a regression.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the significance of the mythical figure Delilah in relation to the weakening of adult men and the return to a childlike state?",
    "answer": "Delilah, in the myth of Samson, cuts off Samson\u2019s hair, which symbolizes the sun\u2019s rays and his strength. By removing his hair, Delilah robs Samson of his strength, causing him to weaken and return to a childlike state. This illustrates how any weakening of an adult man can strengthen the unconscious desires that lead to a regression towards a more dependent and childlike condition.",
