{"paragraph": "\u201cMost of the training of the self, whereby the vagaries of personal  reaction to fact and image are reduced to the basis of sound judgment,  comes through the use of speech. When the child speaks, he lays before  the world his suggestion for a general or common meaning. The  reception he gets confirms or refutes him. In either case he is  instructed. His next venture is now from a platform of knowledge on  which the newer item is more nearly convertible into the common coin  of effective intercourse. The point to notice here is not so much the  exact mechanism of the exchange\u2014secondary conversion\u2014by which this  gain is made, as the training in judgment that the constant use of it  affords. In each case, effective judgment is the common judgment.\u201cHere the object is to point out that it is secured by the development  of a function _whose rise is directly ad hoc_, directly for the social  experimentation by which growth in personal competence is advanced as  well\u2014_the function of speech_.\u201cIn language, therefore, to sum up the foregoing, we have the  tangible\u2014the actual\u2014the historical\u2014instrument of the development and  conservation of psychic meaning. It is the material evidence and proof  of the _concurrence of social and personal judgment_. In it synomic  meaning, judged as \u2018appropriate,\u2019 becomes \u2018social\u2019 meaning, held as  socially generalized and acknowledged.\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
