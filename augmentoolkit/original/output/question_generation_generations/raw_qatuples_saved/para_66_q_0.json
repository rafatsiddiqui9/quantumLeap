    "paragraph": "When I said just now that directed thinking is properly a thinking with words, and quoted that clever testimony of Anatole France as drastic proof of it, a misunderstanding might easily arise, namely, that directed thinking is really only \u201cword.\u201d That certainly would go too far. Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider sense than that of speech, which is in itself only the expression of the formulated thought which is capable of being communicated in the widest sense. Otherwise, the deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity for thinking, which is not the case in reality. Without any knowledge of the spoken word, he has his \u201clanguage.\u201d This language, considered from the standpoint of history, or in other words, directed thinking, is here a descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance, Wundt[22] expresses it.\u201cA further important result of that co-operation of sound and sign  interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually lose  altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and turn into  signs for general ideas and for the expression of the apperceptive  functions of relation and comparison and their products. In this  manner abstract thought develops, which, because it would not be  possible without the change of meaning lying at the root of it, is  indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical reciprocal  action out of which the development of language takes place.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the author mean when they say that directed thinking is properly a thinking with words?",
    "answer": "The author means that directed thinking involves the use of linguistic processes, which can include both speech and other forms of communication. This suggests that thinking is not just a purely mental activity but one that can be articulated and shared through various means, including written or signed languages.",
