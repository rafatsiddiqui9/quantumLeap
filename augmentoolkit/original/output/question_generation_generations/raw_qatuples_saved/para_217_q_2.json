And the boy looks up familiarly  To his Father, Helios,  And, tasting the sweet grapes,  He picked the sacred vine for his nurse,  And soon he is grown; the beasts  Fear him, for he is different from them:  This man; he is not like thee, the father,  For the lofty soul of the father,  Is in him boldly united with thy pleasures,  And thy sadness, O Earth,  He may resemble the eternal Nature,  The mother of Gods, the terrible Mother.\u201cAh! therefore, O Earth,  His presumption drives him away from thy breast,  And thy gifts are vain, the tender ones;  Ever and ever too high does the proud heart beat.\u201cOut from the sweet meadow of his shores  Man must go into the flowerless waters,  And tho his groves shine with golden fruit,  Like the starry night, yet he digs,  He digs caves in the mountains, and seeks in the mines,  Far from the sacred rays of his father,  Faithless also to the Sun-god,  Who does not love weaklings, and mocks at cares.\u201cAh! freer do the birds of the wood breathe:  Although the breast of man heaves wilder and more proudly,  His pride becomes fear, and the tender flowers  Of his peace do not bloom for long.\u201dThis poem betrays to us the beginning of the discord between the poet and nature; he begins to be estranged from reality, the natural actual existence. It is a remarkable idea how the little child chooses \u201cthe vine for his nurse.\u201d This Dionysian allusion is very old. In the significant blessing of Jacob it is said of Judah (Genesis, chap. xlix, verse 11):\u201cBinding his foal unto the vine, and his ass\u2019s colt unto the choice  vine.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the poet imply about the child's nature compared to other beings, and what does the poem suggest about the relationship between humans and the natural world?\n\n**ANS:** \nThe poet implies that the child is different from other beings, as the beasts fear him. This suggests that the child possesses a higher, more divine nature. The poem suggests that humans are estranged from the natural world; despite their potential to resemble the eternal nature of the universe, they are driven away from the Earth's embrace due to their pride, leading them to seek refuge in caves and mines, far from the natural light and care of their sun-god father.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the poem convey the child's transition from the natural world to a more human, Earth-bound existence?",
    "answer": "The poem conveys the child's transition from the natural world to a more human, Earth-bound existence by describing the child's birth from the Earth under the grapes and his subsequent integration with both the Earth and the sun. However, the child is eventually driven away from the Earth as his heart becomes too proud and his existence becomes too distant from the natural rays of his father. This suggests a transition from a more divine or natural state to a more human, earth-bound one marked by pride and estrangement from the natural world.",
