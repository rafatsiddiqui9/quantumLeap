    "paragraph": "In Slav _mara_ means \u201cwitch\u201d; poln. _mora_ = demon, nightmare; _m\u014dr_ or _m\u014dre_ (Swiss-German) means \u201csow,\u201d also as an insult. The Bohemian _mura_ means \u201cnightmare\u201d and \u201cevening moth, Sphinx.\u201d This strange connection is explained through analysis where it often occurs that animals with movable shells (Venus shell) or wings are utilized for very transparent reasons as symbols of the female genitals.[525] The Sphingina are the twilight moths; they, like the nightmare, come in the darkness. Finally, it is to be observed that the sacred olive tree of Athens is called \u201c\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u201d (that was derived from \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2). Halirrhotios wished to cut down the tree, but killed himself with the axe in the attempt.The sound resemblance of _mar_, _m\u00e8re_ with _meer_ = sea and Latin _mare_ = sea is remarkable, although etymologically accidental. Might it refer back to \u201cthe great primitive idea of the mother\u201d who, in the first place, meant to us our individual world and afterwards became the symbol of all worlds? Goethe said of the mothers: \u201cThey are encircled by images of all creatures.\u201d The Christians, too, could not refrain from reuniting their mother of God with water. \u201cAve Maris stella\u201d is the beginning of a hymn to Mary. Then again it is the horses of Neptune which symbolize the waves of the sea. It is probably of importance that the infantile word ma-ma (mother\u2019s breast) is repeated in its initial sound in all possible languages, and that the mothers of two religious heroes are called Mary and Maya. That the mother is the horse of the child is to be seen most plainly in the primitive custom of carrying the child on the back or letting it ride on the hip. Odin hung on the \u201cworld-ash,\u201d the mother, his \u201chorse of terror.\u201d The Egyptian sun-god sits on the back of his mother, the heavenly cow.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the horse symbol in relation to mothers and children, and can you provide examples from the text?",
    "answer": "The horse symbol is significant in relation to mothers and children, as the mother is often seen as the \"horse\" of the child. This is evident in various customs, such as carrying the child on the back or letting them ride on the hip. The text provides examples like Odin hanging on the \"world-ash,\" which is described as the mother, his \"horse of terror,\" and the Egyptian sun-god sitting on the back of his mother, the heavenly cow.",
