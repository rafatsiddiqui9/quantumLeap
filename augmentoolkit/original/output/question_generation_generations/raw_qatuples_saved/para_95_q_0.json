    "paragraph": " This interpretation would seem to be supported by the otherwise enigmatic function of the dog in the Sacrificium Mithriacum. In the monuments a dog always leaps up upon the bull killed by Mithra. However, this sacrifice is probably to be interpreted through the Persian legend, as well as through the monument, as the moment of the _highest fecundity_. The most beautiful expression of this is seen upon the magnificent Mithra relief of Heddernheim. Upon one side of a large stone slab (formerly probably rotating) is seen the stereotyped overthrowing and sacrifice of the bull, but upon the other side stands Sol, with a bunch of grapes in his hand, Mithra with the cornucopia, the Dadophores with fruits, corresponding to the legend that all fecundity proceeds from the dead bull of the world, fruits from the horns, wine from its blood, grain from the tail, cattle from its sperma, leek from its nose, and so on. Silvanus stands above this scene with the animals of the forest arising from him. The significance suspected by Creuzer might very easily belong to the dog in this connection.[479] Let us now turn back to the myth of Osiris. In spite of the restoration of the corpse accomplished by Isis, the resuscitation succeeds only incompletely in so far as the phallus of Osiris cannot again be produced, because it was eaten by the fishes; the power of life was wanting.[480] Osiris as a phantom once more impregnated Isis, but the fruit is Harpocrates, who was feeble in \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd \u03b3\u03c5\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 (in the lower limbs), that is, corresponding to the significance of \u03b3\u03c5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd (at the feet). (Here, as is plainly evident, foot is used in the phallic meaning.) This incurability of the setting sun corresponds to the incurability of R\u00ea in the above-mentioned older Egyptian sun hymn. Osiris, although only a phantom, now prepares the young sun, his son Horus, for a battle with Typhon, the evil spirit of darkness.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the dog in the Sacrificium Mithriacum according to the text?",
    "answer": "The dog in the Sacrificium Mithriacum is significant because it leaps up upon the bull killed by Mithra. This action is interpreted as symbolizing the moment of highest fecundity, which is further supported by the monuments and monuments like the Mithra relief of Heddernheim where fruits, wine, grain, and other elements are derived from the dead bull.",
