He is buried\nin the depths of _self, as if in the earth_; really a dead man who has\nturned back to mother earth;[621] a Kaineus “piled with a hundred\nburdens” and pressed down to death; the one who groaning bears the heavy\nburden of his own libido, of that libido which draws him back to the\nmother. Who does not think of the Taurophoria of Mithra, who took his\nbull (according to the Egyptian hymn, “the bull of his mother”), that\nis, his love for his mother, the heaviest burden upon his back, and with\nthat entered upon the painful course of the so-called Transitus![622]\nThis path of passion led to the cave, in which the bull was sacrificed.\nChrist, too, had to bear the cross,[623] the symbol of his love for the\nmother, and he carried it to the place of sacrifice where the lamb was\nslain in the form of the God, the infantile man, a “self-executioner,”\nand then to burial in the subterranean sepulchre.[624]\n\nThat which in Nietzsche appears as a poetical figure of speech is really\na primitive myth. It is as if the poet still possessed a dim idea or\ncapacity to feel and reactivate those imperishable phantoms of long-past\nworlds of thought in the words of our present-day speech and in the\nimages which crowd themselves into his phantasy. Hauptmann also says:\n“Poetic rendering is that which allows the echo of the primitive word to\nresound through the form.”[625]\n\n\nThe sacrifice, with its mysterious and manifold meaning, which is rather\nhinted at than expressed, passes unrecognized in the unconscious of our\nauthor. The arrow is not shot, the hero Chiwantopel is not yet fatally\npoisoned and ready for death through self-sacrifice. We now can say,\naccording to the preceding material, this sacrifice means renouncing the\nmother, that is to say, _renunciation of all bonds and limitations which\nthe soul has taken with it from the period of childhood into the adult\nlife_. From various hints of Miss Miller’s it appears that at the time\nof these phantasies she was still living in the circle of the family,\nevidently at an age which was in urgent need of independence. That is to\nsay, man does not live very long in the infantile environment or in the\nbosom of his family without real danger to his mental health. Life calls\nhim forth to independence, and he who gives no heed to this hard call\nbecause of childish indolence and fear is threatened by a neurosis, and\nonce the neurosis has broken out it becomes more and more a valid reason\nto escape the battle with life and to remain for all time in the morally\npoisoned infantile atmosphere.\n\nThe phantasy of the arrow-wound belongs in this struggle for personal\nindependence. The thought of this resolution has not yet penetrated the\ndreamer. On the contrary, she rather repudiates it. After all the\npreceding, it is evident that the symbolism of the arrow-wound through\ndirect translation must be taken as a coitus symbol. The “Occide\nmoriturus” attains by this means the sexual significance belonging to\nit. Chiwantopel naturally represents the dreamer. But nothing is\nattained and nothing is understood through one’s reduction to the coarse\nsexual, because it is a commonplace that the unconscious shelters coitus\nwishes, the discovery of which signifies nothing further. _The coitus\nwish under this aspect is really a symbol for the individual\ndemonstration of the libido separated from the parents, of the conquest\nof an independent life._ This step towards a new life means, at the same\ntime, the death of the past life.[626] Therefore, Chiwantopel is the\ninfantile hero[627] (the son, the child, the lamb, the fish) who is\nstill enchained by the fetters of childhood and who has to die as a\nsymbol of the incestuous libido, and with that sever the retrogressive\nbond. For the entire libido is demanded for the battle of life, and\nthere can be no remaining behind. The dreamer cannot yet come to this\ndecision, which will tear aside all the sentimental connections with\nfather and mother, and yet it must be made in order to follow the call\nof the individual destiny.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VII\n                          THE DUAL MOTHER RÔLE\n\n\nAfter the disappearance of the assailant, Chiwantopel begins the\nfollowing monologue:\n\n  “From the extreme ends of these continents, from the farthest\n  lowlands, after having forsaken the palace of my father, I have been\n  wandering aimlessly during a hundred moons, always pursued by my mad\n  desire to find ‘her who will understand.’ With jewels I have tempted\n  many fair ones, with kisses I have tried to snatch the secret of their\n  hearts, with acts of bravery I have conquered their admiration. (He\n  reviews the women he has known.) Chita, the princess of my race ...\n  she is a little fool, vain as a peacock, having nought in her head but\n  jewels and perfume. Ta-nan, the young peasant, ... bah, a mere sow, no\n  more than a breast and a stomach, caring only for pleasure. And then\n  Ki-ma, the priestess, a true parrot, repeating hollow phrases learnt\n  from the priests; all for show, without real education or sincerity,\n  suspicious poseur and hypocrite!... Alas! Not one who understands me,\n  not one who resembles me, not one who has a soul sister to mine. There\n  is not one among them all who has known my soul, not one who could\n  read my thought; far from it; not one capable of seeking with me the\n  luminous summits, or of spelling with me the superhuman word, love.”\n\nHere Chiwantopel himself says that his journeying and wandering is a\nquest for that other, and for the meaning of life which lies in union\nwith her. In the first part of this work we merely hinted gently at this\npossibility. The fact that the seeker is masculine and the sought-for of\nfeminine sex is not so astonishing, because the chief object of the\nunconscious transference is the mother, as has probably been seen from\nthat which we have already learned. The daughter takes a male attitude\ntowards the mother. The genesis of this adjustment can only be suspected\nin our case, because objective proof is lacking. Therefore, let us\nrather be satisfied with inferences. “She who will understand” means the\nmother, in the infantile language. At the same time, it also means the\nlife companion. As is well known, the sex contrast concerns the libido\nbut little. The sex of the object plays a surprisingly slight rôle in\nthe estimation of the unconscious. The object itself, taken as an\nobjective reality, is but of slight significance. (But it is of greatest\nimportance whether the libido is transferred or introverted.) The\noriginal concrete meaning of _erfassen_, “to seize,” _begreifen_, “to\ntouch,” etc., allows us to recognize clearly the under side of the\nwish—to find a congenial person. But the “upper” intellectual half is\nalso contained in it, and is to be taken into account at the same time.\nOne might be inclined to assume this tendency if it were not that our\nculture abused the same, for the misunderstood woman has become almost\nproverbial, which can only be the result of a wholly distorted\nvaluation. On the one side, our culture undervalues most extraordinarily\nthe importance of sexuality; on the other side, sexuality breaks out as\na direct result of the repression burdening it at every place where it\ndoes not belong, and makes use of such an indirect manner of expression\nthat one may expect to meet it suddenly almost anywhere. Thus the idea\nof the intimate comprehension of a human soul, which is in reality\nsomething very beautiful and pure, is soiled and disagreeably distorted\nthrough the entrance of the indirect sexual meaning.[628] The secondary\nmeaning or, better expressed, the misuse, which repressed and denied\nsexuality forces upon the highest soul functions, makes it possible, for\nexample, for certain of our opponents to scent in psychoanalysis\nprurient erotic confessionals. These are subjective wish-fulfilment\ndeliria which need no contra arguments. This misuse makes the wish to be\n“understood” highly suspicious, if the natural demands of life have not\nbeen fulfilled. Nature has _first claim_ on man; only long afterwards\ndoes the luxury of intellect come. The mediæval ideal of life for the\nsake of death needs gradually to be replaced by a natural conception of\nlife, in which the normal demands of men are thoroughly kept in mind, so\nthat the desires of the animal sphere may no longer be compelled to drag\ndown into their service the high gifts of the intellectual sphere in\norder to find an outlet. We are inclined, therefore, to consider the\ndreamer’s wish for understanding, first of all, as a repressed striving\ntowards the natural destiny. This meaning coincides absolutely with\npsychoanalytic experience, that there are countless neurotic people who\napparently are prevented from experiencing life because they have an\nunconscious and often also a conscious repugnance to the sexual fate,\nunder which they imagine all kinds of ugly things. There is only too\ngreat an inclination to yield to this pressure of the unconscious\nsexuality and to experience the dreaded (unconsciously hoped for)\ndisagreeable sexual experience, so as to acquire by that means a\nlegitimately founded horror which retains them more surely in the\ninfantile situation. This is the reason why so many people fall into\nthat very state towards which they have the greatest abhorrence.\n\nThat we were correct in our assumption that, in Miss Miller, it is a\nquestion of the battle for independence is shown by her statement that\nthe hero’s departure from his father’s house reminds her of the fate of\nthe young Buddha, who likewise renounced all luxury to which he was born\nin order to go out into the world to live out his destiny to its\ncompletion. Buddha gave the same heroic example as did Christ, who\nseparated from his mother, and even spoke bitter words (Matthew, chap.\nx. v. 34):\n\n  “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send\n  peace, but a sword.\n\n  (35) “For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and\n  the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her\n  mother-in-law.\n\n  (36) “And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.\n\n  (37) “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of\n  me.”\n\nOr _Luke_, chap. xii, v. 51:\n\n  “Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay:\n  but rather division.\n\n  (52) “For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,\n  three against two, and two against three.\n\n  (53) “The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against\n  the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against\n  the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the\n  daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”\n\nHorus snatched from his mother her head adornment, the power. Just as\nAdam struggled with Lilith, so he struggles for power. Nietzsche, in\n“Human, All Too Human,” expressed the same in very beautiful words:\n\n  “One may suppose that a mind, in which the ‘type of free mind’ is to\n  ripen and sweeten at maturity, has had its decisive crisis in a great\n  detachment, so that before this time it was just so much the more a\n  fettered spirit and appeared chained forever to its corner and its\n  pillar.[629] What binds it most firmly? What cords are almost\n  untearable? Among human beings of a high and exquisite type, it would\n  be duties: that reverence, which is suitable for youth, that modesty\n  and tenderness for all the old honored and valued things, that\n  thankfulness for the earth from which they grew, for the hand which\n  guided them, for the shrine where they learnt to pray:—their loftiest\n  moments themselves come to bind them the firmest, to obligate them the\n  most permanently. The great detachment comes suddenly for people so\n  bound.",
