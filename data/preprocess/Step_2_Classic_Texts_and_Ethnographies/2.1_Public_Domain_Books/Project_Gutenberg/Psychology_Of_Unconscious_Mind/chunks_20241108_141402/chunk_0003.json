For with the\ndevelopment of the incestuous bond the natural repressions deepen\nbecause the moral censor cannot allow these disturbing relations to\nbecome clear to the individual. Therefore, the whole matter is repressed\nmore deeply into the unconscious, and even a feeling of positive enmity\nand repulsion towards the parents is often developed in order to conceal\nand over-compensate for the impossible situation actually present.\n\nThis persistence of the attachment of the libido to the original object,\nand the inability to find in this a suitable satisfaction for the adult\nneed, interferes with the normal development of the psycho-sexual\ncharacter, and it is due to this that the adult retains that\n“infantilism of sexuality” which plays so great a rôle in determining\nthe instability of the emotional life which so frequently leads into the\ndefinite neuroses.\n\n\nThese were the conclusions reached and the ground on which Freudian\npsychology rested, regarding the etiology of the neurosis, and the\ntendencies underlying normal human mechanisms, when Dr. Carl Jung, the\nmost prominent of Freud’s disciples, and the leader of the Zurich\nschool, found himself no longer able to agree with Freud’s findings in\ncertain particulars, although the phenomena which Freud observed and the\ntechnique of psychoanalysis developed by Freud were the material on\nwhich Jung worked and the value of which he clearly emphasizes. The\ndifferences which have developed lay in his understanding and\ninterpretation of the phenomena observed.\n\nBeginning with the conception of libido itself as a term used to connote\nsexual hunger and craving, albeit the meaning of the word sexual was\nextended by Freud to embrace a much wider significance than common usage\nhas assigned it, Jung was unable to confine himself to this limitation.\nHe conceived this longing, this urge or push of life as something\nextending beyond sexuality even in its wider sense. He saw in the term\nlibido a concept of unknown nature, comparable to Bergson’s élan vital,\na hypothetical energy of life, which occupies itself not only in\nsexuality but in various physiological and psychological manifestations\nsuch as growth, development, hunger, and all the human activities and\ninterests. This cosmic energy or urge manifested in the human being he\ncalls libido and compares it with the energy of physics. Although\nrecognizing, in common with Freud as well as with many others, the\nprimal instinct of reproduction as the basis of many functions and\npresent-day activities of mankind no longer sexual in character he\nrepudiates the idea of still calling them sexual, even though their\ndevelopment was a growth originally out of the sexual. Sexuality and its\nvarious manifestations Jung sees as most important channels occupied by\nlibido, but not the exclusive ones through which libido flows.\n\nThis is an energic concept of life; and from this viewpoint this\nhypothetical energy of life or libido is a living power used\ninstinctively by man in all the automatic processes of his functioning;\nsuch very processes being but different manifestations of this energy.\nBy virtue of its quality of mobility and change man, through his\nunderstanding and intelligence, has the power consciously to direct and\nuse his libido in definite and desired ways.\n\nIn this conception of Jung will be seen an analogy to Bergson, who\nspeaks of “this change, this movement and becoming, this self-creation,\ncall it what you will, as the very stuff and reality of our being.”[2]\n\nIn developing the energic conception of libido and separating it from\nFreud’s sexual definition, Jung makes possible the explanation of\ninterest in general, and provides a working concept by which not only\nthe specifically sexual, but the general activities and reactions of man\ncan be understood.\n\nIf a person complains of no longer having interest in his work or of\nlosing interest in his surroundings, then one understands that his\nlibido is withdrawn from this object and that in consequence the object\nitself seems no longer attractive, whereas, as a matter of fact, the\nobject itself is exactly the same as formerly. In other words, it is the\nlibido that we bestow upon an object that makes it attractive and\ninteresting.\n\nThe causes for the withdrawal of libido may be various and are usually\nquite different from those that the persons offer in explanation. It is\nthe task of psychoanalysis to discover the real reasons, which are\nusually hidden and unknown. On the other hand, when an individual\nexhibits an exaggerated interest or places an over-emphasis upon an idea\nor situation, then we know there is too much libido here and that we may\nfind as a consequence a corresponding depletion elsewhere.\n\nThis leads directly into the second point of difference between Jung’s\nviews and those of Freud. This is concerned with those practically\nuniversal childish manifestations of sexuality called by Freud\n“polymorphous perverse” because of their similarity to those\nabnormalities of sexuality which occur in adults and are called\nperversions.\n\nJung takes exception to this viewpoint. He sees in the various\nmanifestations of childhood the precursors or forerunners of the later\nfully developed sexuality, and instead of considering them perverse he\nconsiders them preliminary expressions of sexual coloring. He divides\nhuman life into three stages. The first stage up to about the third or\nfourth year, generally speaking, he calls the presexual stage, for there\nhe sees the libido or life energy occupied chiefly in the functions of\nnutrition and growth, and he draws an analogy between this period and\nthat of the caterpillar stage of the butterfly.\n\nThe second stage includes the years from this time until puberty, and\nthis he speaks of as the prepubertal stage.\n\nThe third period is that from puberty onward and can be considered the\ntime of maturity.\n\nIt is in the earliest stage, the period of which varies greatly in\ndifferent individuals, that are fully inaugurated those various\nmanifestations which have so marked a sexual coloring that there can be\nno question of their relationship, although at that time sexuality in\nthe adult meaning of the word does not exist.\n\nJung explains the polymorphism of these phenomena as arising from a\ngradual movement of the libido from exclusive service in the function of\nnutrition into new avenues which successively open up with the\ndevelopment of the child until the final inauguration of the sexual\nfunction proper at puberty. Normally these childish bad habits are\ngradually relinquished until the libido is entirely withdrawn from these\nimmature phases and with the ushering in of puberty for the first time\n“appears in the form of an undifferentiated sexual primitive power,\nclearly forcing the individual towards division, budding, etc.”\n\nHowever, if in the course of its movement from the function of nutrition\nto the sexual function the libido is arrested or retarded at any phase,\nthen a _fixation_ may result, creating a disturbance in the harmony of\nthe normal development. For, although the libido is retarded and remains\nclinging to some childish manifestation, time goes on and the physical\ngrowth of the child does not stand still. Soon a great contrast is\ncreated between the infantile manifestations of the emotional life and\nthe needs of the more adult individual, and the foundation is thus\nprepared for either the development of a definite neurosis or else for\nthose weaknesses of character or symptomatic disturbances which are not\nsufficiently serious to be called a neurosis.\n\nOne of the most active and important forms of childish libido occupation\nis in phantasy making. The child’s world is one of imagery and\nmake-believe where he can create for himself that satisfaction and\nenjoyment which the world of reality so often denies. As the child grows\nand real demands of life are made upon him it becomes increasingly\nnecessary that his libido be taken away from his phantastic world and\nused for the required adaptation to reality needed by his age and\ncondition, until finally for the adult the freedom of the whole libido\nis necessary to meet the biological and cultural demands of life.\n\nInstead of thus employing the libido in the real world, however, certain\npeople never relinquish the seeking for satisfaction in the shadowy\nworld of phantasy and even though they make certain attempts at\nadaptation they are halted and discouraged by every difficulty and\nobstacle in the path of life and are easily pulled back into their inner\npsychic world. This condition is called a state of _introversion_. It is\nconcerned with the past and the reminiscences which belong thereto.\nSituations and experiences which should have been completed and finished\nlong ago are still dwelt upon and lived with. Images and matters which\nwere once important but which normally have no significance for their\nlater age are still actively influencing their present lives. The nature\nand character of these phantasy products are legion, and are easily\nrecognized in the emotional attitudes and pretensions, the childish\nillusions and exaggerations, the prejudices and inconsistencies which\npeople express in manifold forms. The actual situation is inadequately\nfaced; small matters are reacted towards in an exaggerated manner; or\nelse a frivolous attitude is maintained where real seriousness is\ndemanded. In other words, there is clearly manifested an inadequate\npsychic adaptation towards reality which is quite to be expected from\nthe child, but which is very discordant in the adult.\n\nThe most important of these past influences is that of the parents.\nBecause they are the first objects of the developing childish love, and\nafford the first satisfaction and pleasure to the child, they become the\nmodels for all succeeding efforts, as Freud has worked out. This he\ncalled the _nuclear_ or _root complex_ because this influence was so\npowerful it seemed to be the determining factor in all later\ndifficulties in the life of the individual.\n\nIn this phase of the problem lies the third great difference between\nJung’s interpretation of the observed phenomena and that of Freud.\n\nJung definitely recognizes that there are many neurotic persons who\nclearly exhibited in their childhood the same neurotic tendencies that\nare later exaggerated. Also that an almost overwhelming effect on the\ndestiny of these children is exercised by the influence of the parents,\nthe frequent over-anxiety or tenderness, the lack of sympathy or\nunderstanding, in other words, the complexes of the parent reacting upon\nthe child and producing in him love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate,\nrevolt. The greater the sensitiveness and impressionability of the\nchild, the more he will be stamped with the familial environment, and\nthe more he will unconsciously seek to find again in the world of\nreality the model of his own small world with all the pleasures and\nsatisfactions, or disappointments and unhappinesses with which it was\nfilled.\n\nThis condition to be sure is not a recognized or a conscious one, for\nthe individual may think himself perfectly free from this past influence\nbecause he is living in the real world, and because actually there is a\ngreat difference between the present conditions and that of his childish\npast. He sees all this, intellectually, but there is a wide gap between\nthe intellectual grasp of a situation and the emotional development, and\nit is the latter realm wherein lies the disharmony. However, although\nmany ideas and feelings are connected with the parents, analysis reveals\nvery often that they are only subjective and that in reality they bear\nlittle resemblance to the actual past situation. Therefore, Jung speaks\nno longer of the real father and mother but uses the term imago or image\nto represent the father or mother, because the feelings and phantasies\nfrequently do not deal with the real parents but with the distorted and\nsubjective image created by the imagination of the individual.\n\nFollowing this distinction Jung sees in the Oedipus complex of Freud\nonly a symbol for the “childish desire towards the parents and for the\nconflict which this craving evokes,” and cannot accept the theory that\nin this early stage of childhood the mother has any real sexual\nsignificance for the child.\n\nThe demands of the child upon the mother, the jealousy so often\nexhibited, are at first connected with the rôle of the mother as\nprotector, caretaker and supplier of nutritive wants, and only later,\nwith the germinating eroticism, does the child’s love become admixed\nwith the developing sexual quality. The chief love objects are still the\nparents and he naturally continues to seek and to find in them\nsatisfaction for all his desires. In this way the typical conflict is\ndeveloped which in the son is directed towards the father and in the\ndaughter towards the mother. This jealousy of the daughter towards the\nmother is called the _Electra complex_ from the myth of Electra who took\nrevenge on her mother for the murder of the husband because she was in\nthis way deprived of her father.\n\nNormally as puberty is attained the child gradually becomes more or less\nfreed from his parents, and upon the degree in which this is\naccomplished depends his health and future well-being.\n\nThis demand of nature upon the young individual to free himself from the\nbonds of his childish dependency and to find in the world of reality his\nindependent existence is so imperious and dominating that it frequently\nproduces in the child the greatest struggles and severest conflicts, the\nperiod being characterized symbolically as a _self-sacrifice_ by Jung.\n\nIt frequently happens that the young person is so closely bound in the\nfamily relations that it is only with the greatest difficulty that he\ncan attain any measure of freedom and then only very imperfectly, so\nthat the libido sexualis can only express itself in certain feelings and\nphantasies which clearly reveal the existence of the complex until then\nentirely hidden and unrealized. Now commences the secondary struggle\nagainst the unfilial and immoral feelings with a consequent development\nof intense resistances expressing themselves in irritation, anger,\nrevolt and antagonism against the parents, or else in an especially\ntender, submissive and yielding attitude which over-compensates for the\nrebellion and reaction held within.",
