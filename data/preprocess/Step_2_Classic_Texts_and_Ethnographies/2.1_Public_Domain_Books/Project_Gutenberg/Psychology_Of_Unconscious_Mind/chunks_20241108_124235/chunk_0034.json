One might rather\nhave expected a description of the facial expression. It is well known\nthat the gesture of the hand is significant; unfortunately, we know\nnothing about that here. Nevertheless, a parallel phantasy might be\nmentioned, which also puts the emphasis upon hands. A patient in a\nhypnagogic condition saw his mother painted on a wall, like a painting\nin a Byzantine church. She held one hand up, open wide, with fingers\nspread apart. The fingers were very large, swollen into knobs on the\nends, and each surrounded by a small halo. The immediate association\nwith this picture was the fingers of a frog with sucking discs at the\nends. Then the similarity to the penis. The ancient setting of this\nmother picture is also of importance. Evidently the hand had, in this\nphantasy, a phallic meaning. This interpretation was confirmed by a\nfurther very remarkable phantasy of the same patient. He saw something\nlike a “sky-rocket” ascending from his mother’s hand, which at a closer\nsurvey becomes a shining bird with golden wings, a golden pheasant, as\nit then occurs to his mind. We have seen in the previous chapter that\nthe hand has actually a phallic, generative meaning, and that this\nmeaning plays a great part in the production of fire. In connection with\nthis phantasy, there is but one observation to make: fire was bored with\nthe hand; therefore it comes from the hand; Agni, the fire, was\nworshipped as a golden-winged bird.[352] It is extremely significant\nthat it is the mother’s hand. I must deny myself the temptation to enter\nmore deeply into this. Let it be sufficient to have pointed out the\npossible significance of the hand of the Aztec by means of these\nparallel hand phantasies. We have mentioned the mother suggestively with\nthe Sphinx. The Aztec taking the place of the Sphinx points, through his\nsuggestive hand, to parallel phantasies in which the phallic hand really\nbelongs to the mother. Likewise we encounter an antique setting in\nparallel phantasies. The significance of the antique, which experience\nhas shown to be the symbol for “infantile,” is confirmed by Miss Miller\nin this connection in the annotation to her phantasies, for she says:\n\n  “In my childhood, I took a special interest in the Aztec fragments and\n  in the history of Peru and of the Incas.”\n\nThrough the two analyses of children which have been published we have\nattained an insight into the child’s small world, and have seen what\nburning interests and questions secretly surround the parents, and that\nthe parents are, for a long time, the objects of the greatest\ninterest.[353] We are, therefore, justified in suspecting that the\nantique setting applies to the “ancients,” that is to say, the parents,\nand that consequently this Aztec has something of the father or mother\nin himself. Up to this time indirect hints point only to the mother,\nwhich is nothing remarkable in an American girl, because Americans, as a\nresult of the extreme detachment from the father, are characterized by a\nmost enormous mother complex, which again is connected with the especial\nsocial position of woman in the United States. This position brings\nabout a special masculinity among capable women, which easily makes\npossible the symbolizing into a masculine figure.[354]\n\nAfter this vision, Miss Miller felt that a name formed itself “bit by\nbit,” which seemed to belong to this Aztec—“the son of an Inca of Peru.”\nThe name is “Chi-wan-to-pel.” As the author intimated, something similar\nto this belonged to her childish reminiscences. The act of naming is,\nlike baptism, something exceedingly important for the creation of a\npersonality, because, since olden times, a magic power has been\nattributed to the name, with which, for example, the spirit of the dead\ncan be conjured. To know the name of any one means, in mythology, to\nhave power over that one. As a well-known example I mention the fairy\ntale of “Rumpelstilzchen.” In an Egyptian myth, Isis robs the Sun god Rê\npermanently of his power by compelling him to tell her his real name.\nTherefore, to give a name means to give power, invest with a definite\npersonality.[355] The author observed, in regard to the name itself,\nthat it reminded her very much of the impressive name Popocatepetl, a\nname which belongs to unforgettable school memories, and, to the\ngreatest indignation of the patient, very often emerges in an analysis\nin a dream or phantasy and brings with it that same old joke which one\nheard in school, told oneself and later again forgot. Although one might\nhesitate to consider this unhallowed joke as of psychologic importance,\nstill one must inquire for the reason of its being. One must also put,\nas a counter question, Why is it always Popocatepetl and not the\nneighboring Iztaccihuatl, or the even higher and just as clear Orizaba?\nThe last has certainly the more beautiful and more easily pronounced\nname. Popocatepetl is impressive because of its onomatopoetic name. In\nEnglish the word is “to pop” (popgun), which is here considered as\nonomatopoesy; in German the words are _Hinterpommern_, _Pumpernickel_;\n_Bombe_; _Petarde_ (_le pet_ = flatus). The frequent German word _Popo_\n(Podex) does not indeed exist in English, but flatus is designated as\n“to poop” in childish speech. The act of defecation is often designated\nas “to pop.” A joking name for the posterior part is “the bum.” (Poop\nalso means the rear end of a ship.) In French, _pouf!_ is onomatopoetic;\n_pouffer_ = _platzen_ (to explode), _la poupe_ = rear end of ship, _le\npoupard_ = the baby in arms, _la poupée_ = doll. _Poupon_ is a pet name\nfor a chubby-faced child. In Dutch _pop_, German _Puppe_ and Latin\n_puppis_ = doll; in Plautus, however, it is also used jokingly for the\nposterior part of the body; _pupus_ means child; _pupula_ = girl, little\ndollie. The Greek word ποππύζω designates a cracking, snapping or\nblowing sound. It is used of kissing; by Theocritus also of the\nassociated noise of flute blowing. The etymologic parallels show a\nremarkable relationship between the part of the body in question and the\nchild. This relationship we will mention here, only to let it drop at\nonce, as this question will claim our attention later.\n\nOne of my patients in his childhood had always connected the act of\ndefecation with a phantasy that his posterior was a volcano and a\nviolent eruption took place, explosion of gases and gushings forth of\nlava. The terms for the elemental occurrences of nature are originally\nnot at all poetical; one thinks, for example, of the beautiful\nphenomenon of the meteor, which the German language most unpoetically\ncalls “Sternschnuppe” (the smouldering wick of a star). Certain South\nAmerican Indians call the shooting star the “urine of the stars.”\nAccording to the principle of the least resistance, expressions are\ntaken from the nearest source available. (For example, the transference\nof the metonymic expression of urination as _Schiffens_, “to rain.”)",
