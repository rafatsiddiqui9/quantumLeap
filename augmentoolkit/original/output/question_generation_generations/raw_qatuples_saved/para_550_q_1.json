    "paragraph": "To be fruitful means, indeed, to destroy one\u2019s self, because with the rise of the succeeding generation the previous one has passed beyond its highest point; thus our descendants are our most dangerous enemies, whom we cannot overcome, for they will outlive us, and, therefore, without fail, will take the power from our enfeebled hands. The anxiety in the face of the erotic fate is wholly understandable, for there is something immeasurable therein. Fate usually hides unknown dangers, and the perpetual hesitation of the neurotic to venture upon life is easily explained by his desire to be allowed to stand still, so as not to take part in the dangerous battle of life.[188] _Whoever renounces the chance to experience must stifle in himself the wish for it, and, therefore, commits a sort of self-murder._ From this the death phantasies which readily accompany the renunciation of the erotic wish are made clear.

The quotation comes\u2014which Miss Miller did not mention\u2014from an uncompleted poem of Byron\u2019s called \u201cHeaven and Earth.\u201d[189] The whole verse follows:",
