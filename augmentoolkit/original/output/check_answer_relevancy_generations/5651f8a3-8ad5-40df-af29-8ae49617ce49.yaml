    of the incest wish into religious exercises is the only one or the only possible
    one. There is also a conscious recognition and understanding with which we can
    take possession of this libido which is bound up in incest and transformed into
    religious exercises so that we no longer need the stage of religious symbolism
    for this end. It is thinkable that instead of doing good to our fellow-men, for
    “the love of Christ,” we do it from the knowledge that humanity, even as ourselves,
    could not exist if, among the herd, the one could not sacrifice himself for the
    other. _This would be the course of moral autonomy, of perfect freedom, when man
    could without compulsion wish that which he must do, and this from knowledge,
    without delusion through belief in the religious symbols._It is a positive creed
    which keeps us infantile and, therefore, ethically inferior. Although of the greatest
    significance from the cultural point of view and of imperishable beauty from the
    æsthetic standpoint, this delusion can no longer ethically suffice humanity striving
