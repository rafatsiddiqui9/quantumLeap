    "paragraph": "One must give the burdening complex of the soul consciously over to the Deity; that is to say, associate it with a definite representation complex which is set up as objectively real, as a person who answers those questions, for us unanswerable. To this inner demand belongs the candid avowal of sin and the Christian humility presuming such an avowal. Both are for the purpose of making it possible for one to examine one\u2019s self and to know one\u2019s self.[84] One may consider the mutual avowal of sins as the most powerful support to this work of education (\u201cConfess, therefore, your sins one to another.\u201d\u2014James v: 16). These measures aim at a conscious recognition of the conflicts, thoroughly psychoanalytic, which is also _a conditio sine qua non_ of the psychoanalytic condition of recovery. Just as psychoanalysis in the hands of the physician, a secular method, sets up the real object of transference as the one to take over the conflicts of the oppressed and to solve them, so the Christian religion sets up the Saviour, considered as real; \u201cIn whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins....\u201d (Eph. i: 7 and Col. i: 14.)[85] He is the deliverer and redeemer of our guilt, a God who stands above sin, \u201cwho did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth\u201d (Pet. ii: 22). \u201cWho his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree\u201d (Pet. ii: 24). \u201cTherefore Christ has been sacrificed once to take away the sins of many\u201d (Heb. ix: 28). The God, thus thought of, is distinguished as innocent in himself and as the self-sacrificer. (These qualities are true also for that amount of energy\u2014libido\u2014which belongs to the representation complex designated the Redeemer.) The conscious projection towards which the Christian education aims, offers, therefore, a double benefit: first, one is kept conscious of the conflict (sins) of two opposing tendencies mutually resistant, and through this one prevents a known trouble from ",

    "question": "What is the significance of mutual avowal of sins in the educational process described here?",
    "answer": "Mutual avowal of sins is considered the most powerful support for the work of education because it helps in the conscious recognition and examination of inner conflicts. This process aids in thoroughly psychoanalyzing the self and understanding the conflicts between opposing tendencies, which are mutually resistant.",
