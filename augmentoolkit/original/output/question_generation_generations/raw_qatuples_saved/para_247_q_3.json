    "paragraph": "\u201cLordly son of the Gods! Because you lost your loved one, You went to the rocky coast and cried aloud to the flood, Till the depths of the holy abyss heard and echoed your grief, From the far reaches of your heart. Down, deep down, far from the clamor   of ships, Deep under the waves, in a peaceful cave, Dwelt the beautiful Thetis, she who protected you, the Goddess of the   Sea, Mother of the youth was she; the powerful Goddess, She who once had lovingly nursed him, On the rocky shore of his island; she who had made him a hero With the might of her strengthening bath and the powerful song of the   waves. And the mother, mourning, hearkened to the cry of her child, And rose, like a cloud, from the bed of the sea, Soothing with tender embraces the pains of her darling; And he listened, while she, caressing, promised to soften his grief.\u201cSon of the Gods! Oh, were I like you, then could I confidently Call on the Heavenly Ones to hearken to my secret grief. But never shall I see this\u2014I shall bear the disgrace As if I never belonged to her, even though she thinks of me with tears. Beneficent Ones! And yet Ye hear the lightest prayers of men. Ah, how rapt and fervently I worshipped you, holy Light, Since I have lived, the Earth and its fountains and woodlands, Father Ether\u2014and my heart has felt you about me, so ardent and pure\u2014 Oh, soften my sorrows, ye Kind Ones, That my soul may not be silenced, may not be struck dumb too early; That I may live and thank Ye, O Heavenly Powers, With joyful songs through all the hurrying days. Thank ye for gifts of the past, for the joys of vanished Youth\u2014 And then, pray, take me, the lonely one, Graciously, unto yourselves.\u201d",
