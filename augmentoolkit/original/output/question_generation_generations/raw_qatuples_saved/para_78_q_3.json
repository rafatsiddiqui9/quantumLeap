    "paragraph": "Were I to suppose among my readers a far-reaching ignorance of dream analysis, then I should be obliged to illustrate this statement with numerous examples. To-day, however, these things are quite well known, so that one must proceed carefully with every-day dream material, out of consideration for a public educated in these matters. It is a special inconvenience that no dream can be recounted without being obliged to add to it half a life\u2019s history which affords the individual foundations of the dream, but there are some few typical dreams which can be told without too great a ballast. One of these is the dream of the sexual assault, which is especially prevalent among women. A girl sleeping after an evening happily spent in dancing, dreams that a robber breaks open her door noisily and stabs through her body with a lance. This theme, which explains itself, has countless variations, some simple, some complicated. Instead of the lance it is a sword, a dagger, a revolver, a gun, a cannon, a hydrant, a watering pot; or the assault is a burglary, a pursuit, a robbery, or it is some one hidden in the closet or under the bed. Or the danger may be illustrated by wild animals; for instance, a horse which throws the dreamer to the ground and kicks her in the body with his hind foot; lions, tigers, elephants with threatening trunks, and finally snakes in endless variety. Sometimes the snake creeps into the mouth, sometimes it bites the breast like Cleopatra\u2019s legendary asp, sometimes it comes in the r\u00f4le of the paradisical snake, or in the variations of Franz Stuck, whose pictures of snakes bear the significant titles \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cSin,\u201d \u201cLust.\u201d The mixture of lust and anxiety is expressed incomparably in the very atmosphere of these pictures, and far more brutally, indeed, than in M\u00f6rike\u2019s charming poem._The Maiden\u2019s First Love Song_",

    "question": "What is an example of how the mixture of lust and anxiety in dreams of sexual assault is expressed through an artwork?",
    "answer": "The mixture of lust and anxiety in dreams of sexual assault is expressed through the artwork of Franz Stuck. His pictures of snakes are titled with significant themes such as \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cSin,\u201d and \u201cLust.\u201d These titles and the images themselves convey the atmosphere of the dream, combining the erotic and the anxious in a direct and powerful manner. This is also reflected in his artwork, which is noted for its powerful and blunt expression of these complex feelings, unlike the more romanticized depiction in M\u00f6rike\u2019s poem \u201cThe Maiden\u2019s First Love Song.\u201d",
