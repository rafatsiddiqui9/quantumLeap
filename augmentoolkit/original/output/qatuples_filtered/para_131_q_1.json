And who is it who is still to come?\u201cWho is the shepherd into whose mouth crept the snake? Who is the man  into whose throat all the heaviness and the blackest would creep?[762]\u201cBut the shepherd bit, as my cry had told him; he bit with a huge  bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent\u2014and sprang up.\u201cNo longer shepherd, no longer man, a transfigured being, an  illuminated being, who laughed! Never yet on earth did a man laugh as  he laughed!\u201cO my brethren, I heard a laugh which was no human laughter\u2014and now a  thirst consumeth me, a longing that is never allayed.\u201cMy longing for this laugh eats into me. Oh, how can I suffer still to  live! And how now can I bear to die!\u201d[763]The snake represents the introverting libido.
