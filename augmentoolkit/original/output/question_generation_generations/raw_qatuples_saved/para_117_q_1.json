    "paragraph": "We know, from our own experience, this state of mind. It is an infantile stage. To a child the moon is a man or a face or a shepherd of the stars. The clouds in the sky seem like little sheep; the dolls drink, eat and sleep; the child places a letter at the window for the Christ-child; he calls to the stork to bring him a little brother or sister; the cow is the wife of the horse, and the dog the husband of the cat. We know, too, that lower races, like the negroes, look upon the locomotive as an animal, and call the drawers of the table the child of the table.",

    "question": "How might a child perceive clouds and other inanimate objects?",
    "answer": "A child might perceive clouds as little sheep, imagining that they move and are alive. Similarly, a child might see dolls as having human traits, such as the ability to drink, eat, and sleep, and might even place a letter at the window for the Christ-child, showing a belief in magical or human-like attributes in inanimate objects.",
