{"paragraph": "\u201cGoddesses unknown to ye,    The Mortals,\u2014named by us unwillingly.    Delve in the deepest depths must thou to reach them:    \u2019Tis thine own fault that we for help beseech them.\u201cWhere is the way?\u201cNo way! To the Unreachable,    Ne\u2019er to be trodden! A way to the Unbeseechable,    Never to be besought! Art thou prepared?    There are no locks, no latches to be lifted!    Through endless solitudes shalt thou be drifted!    Hast thou through solitudes and deserts dared?    And hadst thou swum to farthest verge of ocean    And there the boundless space beheld,    Still hadst thou seen wave after wave in motion,    Even though impending doom thy fear compelled.    Thou hadst seen something\u2014in the beryl dim    Of peace-lulled seas, the sportive dolphins swim;    Hadst seen the flying clouds, sun, moon and star;    Nought shalt thou see in endless Void afar\u2014    Not hear thy footstep fall, nor meet    A stable spot to rest thy feet.\u201cHere, take this key!    The Key will scent the true place from all others;    Follow it down! \u2018Twill lead thee to the Mothers.\u201cDescend then! I could also say: Ascend!    \u2019Twere all the same. _Escape from the Created_    To shapeless forms in liberated spaces!    Enjoy what long ere this was dissipated!    There whirls the press, like clouds on clouds unfolding;    Then with stretched arm swing high the key thou\u2019rt holding!", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
