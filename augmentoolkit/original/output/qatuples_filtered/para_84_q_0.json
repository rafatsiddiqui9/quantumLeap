    "paragraph": "\u201cWhat is thought, and how do we think? We think with words; that alone  is sensual and brings us back to nature. Think of it! The  metaphysician has only the perfected cry of monkeys and dogs with  which to construct the system of the world. That which he calls  profound speculation and transcendent method is to put end to end in  an arbitrary order the natural sounds which cry out hunger, fear, and  love in the primitive forests, and to which were attached little by  little the meanings which one believed to be abstract, when they were  only crude.\u201cDo not fear that the succession of small cries, feeble and stifled,  which compose a book of philosophy, will teach us so much regarding  the universe, that we can live in it no longer.\u201dThus is our directed thinking, and even if we were the loneliest and furthest removed from our fellows, this thinking is nothing but the first notes of a long-drawn-out call to our companions that water had been found, that we had killed the bear, that a storm was approaching, or that wolves were prowling around the camp. A striking paradox of Ab\u00e9lard\u2019s which expresses in a very intuitive way the whole human limitation of our complicated thinking process, reads,\u2014\u201c_Sermo generatur ab intellectu et generat intellectum_.\u201d[20]Any system of philosophy, no matter how abstract, represents in means and purpose nothing more than an extremely cleverly developed combination of original nature sounds.[21] Hence arises the desire of a Schopenhauer or a Nietzsche for recognition and understanding, and the despair and bitterness of their loneliness. One might expect, perhaps, that a man full of genius could pasture in the greatness of his own thoughts, and renounce the cheap approbation of the crowd which he despises; yet he succumbs to the more powerful impulse of the herd instinct. His searching and his finding, his call, belong to the herd.",

    "question": "How does the author describe the nature of thinking and the role of words in our cognitive processes?",
    "answer": "The author describes thinking as a process that relies heavily on words, which are essentially natural sounds that have evolved from simple cries and calls. These sounds, when combined in specific sequences, form the basis of our complex thinking and communication. The author suggests that even profound philosophical speculation is nothing more than a structured arrangement of these natural sounds, which originally represented basic emotions and needs.",
