    "paragraph": "theoretically, from the standpoint of the Freudian theory of libido. If Abraham believes that through the withdrawal of the libido from the outer world the paranoid system or the schizophrenic symptomatology results, then this assumption is not justified from the standpoint of the knowledge of that time, because a mere libido introversion and regression leads, speedily, as Freud has clearly shown, into the neuroses, and, strictly speaking, into the transference neuroses, and not into dementia pr\u00e6cox. Therefore, the transference of the libido theory to dementia pr\u00e6cox is impossible, because this illness produces a loss of reality which cannot be explained by the deficiency of the libido defined in this narrow sense.",

    "question": "What are transference neuroses, and how do they differ from dementia pr\u00e6cox?",
    "answer": "Transference neuroses are a type of neurosis that arises from the patient's transfer of emotional attitudes or reactions from significant figures in their past to their therapist or treatment provider. They typically involve neurotic symptoms that can be understood within the framework of introverted libido and regression. Dementia pr\u00e6cox, on the other hand, is a severe mental disorder characterized by a loss of reality, delusions, and hallucinations, which cannot be explained by the simple introversion of libido and regression.",
