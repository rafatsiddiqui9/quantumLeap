    "paragraph": "This leads into the second fundamental conception, which is perhaps even less considered than the foregoing, and that is the relative value of the conscious mind and thought. It is the general attitude of people to judge themselves by their surface motives, to satisfy themselves by saying or thinking \u201cthis is what I want to do or say\u201d or \u201cI intended to do thus and so,\u201d but somehow what one thought, one intended to say or expected to do is very often the contrary of what actually is said or done. Every one has had these experiences when the gap between the conscious thought and action was gross enough to be observed. It is also a well known experience to consciously desire something very much and when it is obtained to discover that this in no wise satisfied or lessened the desire, which was then transferred to some other object. Thus one became cognizant of the fact that the feeling and idea presented by consciousness as the desire was an error. What is the difficulty in these conditions? Evidently some other directing force than that of which we are aware is at work.",

    "question": "What evidence is given in the text to support the idea that there is a force other than conscious thought influencing behavior?",
    "answer": "The text provides evidence through personal experiences where the gap between conscious thought and action is observed to be significant. For instance, individuals may plan to do or say something, yet their actual actions or words often differ. Additionally, the experience of desiring something intensely and then finding that the fulfillment of that desire does not diminish the desire, leading to a shift in focus to another desire, demonstrates that there is a force other than conscious thought at play.",
