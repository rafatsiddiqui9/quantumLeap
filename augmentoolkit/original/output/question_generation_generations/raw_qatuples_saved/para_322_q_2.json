    "paragraph": "That quotation, which, apparently, skips lightly over the situation, \u201cOnly this, and nothing more,\u201d comes from a text which depicts in an affecting manner the despair over the lost Lenore. That quotation also misleads our poet in the most striking manner. Therefore, she undervalues the erotic impression and the wide-reaching effect of the commotion caused by it. It is this undervaluation, which Freud has formulated more precisely as \u201crepression,\u201d which is the reason why the erotic problem does not attain directly conscious treatment, and from this there arise \u201cthese psychologic riddles.\u201d The erotic impression works in the unconscious, and, in its stead, pushes symbols forth into consciousness. Thus, one plays hide-and-seek with one\u2019s self. First, it is \u201cthe morning stars which sing together\u201d; then \u201cParadise Lost\u201d; then the erotic yearning clothes itself in an ecclesiastical dress and utters dark words about \u201cWorld Creation\u201d and finally rises into a religious hymn to find there, at last, a way out into freedom, a way against which the censor of the moral personality can oppose nothing more. The hymn contains in its own peculiar character the marks of its origin. It thus has fulfilled itself\u2014the \u201cLaw of the Return of the Complex.\u201d The night singer, in this circuitous manner of the old transference to the Father-Priest, has become the \u201cEternal,\u201d the \u201cCreator,\u201d the _God of Tone, of Light, of Love_.",

    "question": "What does the author refer to as \"repression,\" and why is it significant in the context of the poem?",
    "answer": "The author refers to \"repression\" as the undervaluation of the erotic problem, which leads to the unconscious handling of the erotic impression. This undervaluation is significant because it prevents the erotic issue from being directly treated in conscious thought, leading to \"psychologic riddles\" and symbolic expressions in the poem.",
