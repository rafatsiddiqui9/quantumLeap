THE OEDIPUS PROBLEM

The Oedipus problem is a classic problem in Western literature, first introduced by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles in his tragedy Oedipus Rex. The story revolves around Oedipus, the king of Thebes, who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother.

The problem is often seen as a metaphor for the human condition, exploring themes of fate, free will, and the complexities of human nature.
