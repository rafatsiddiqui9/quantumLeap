For whomsoever the proof may appear insufficient, and it is\ncertainly insufficient for a beginner, further evidence may be found in\nthe fundamental work of Freud, and in the works of Stekel and Rank which\nare fuller in certain particulars. We must assume here that the dream\nsymbolism is an established fact, in order to bring to our study a mind\nsuitably prepared for an appreciation of this work. We would not be\nsuccessful if we, on the contrary, were to be astonished at the idea\nthat an intellectual image can be projected into our conscious psychic\nactivity; an image which apparently obeys such wholly other laws and\npurposes than those governing the conscious psychic product.\n\n_Why are dreams symbolic?_ Every “why” in psychology is divided into two\nseparate questions: first, _for what purpose are dreams symbolic_? We\nwill answer this question only to abandon it at once. Dreams are\nsymbolic in order that they can not be understood; in order that the\nwish, which is the source of the dream, may remain unknown. The question\nwhy this is so and not otherwise, leads us out into the far-reaching\nexperiences and trains of thought of the Freudian psychology.\n\nHere the second question interests us, viz., _How is it that dreams are\nsymbolic?_ That is to say, from where does this capacity for symbolic\nrepresentation come, of which we, in our conscious daily life, can\ndiscover apparently no traces?\n\nLet us examine this more closely. Can we really discover nothing\nsymbolic in our every-day thought? Let us follow our trains of thought;\nlet us take an example. We think of the war of 1870 and 1871. We think\nabout a series of bloody battles, the siege of Strassburg, Belfort,\nParis, the Treaty of Peace, the foundation of the German Empire, and so\non. How have we been thinking? We start with an idea, or super-idea, as\nit is also called, and without thinking of it, but each time merely\nguided by a feeling of direction, we think about individual\nreminiscences of the war. In this we can find nothing symbolic, and our\nwhole conscious thinking proceeds according to this type.[13]\n\nIf we observe our thinking very narrowly, and follow an intensive train\nof thought, as, for example, the solution of a difficult problem, then\nsuddenly we notice that we are thinking in words, that in wholly\nintensive thinking we begin to speak to ourselves, or that we\noccasionally write down the problem, or make a drawing of it so as to be\nabsolutely clear. It must certainly have happened to any one who has\nlived for some time in a foreign country, that after a certain period he\nhas begun to think in the language of the country. A very intensive\ntrain of thinking works itself out more or less in _word form_; that is,\nif one wants to express it, to teach it, or to convince any one of it.\nEvidently it directs itself wholly to the outside world. To this extent,\nthis directed or logical thinking is a reality thinking,[14] having a\nreal existence for us; that is to say, a thinking which adjusts itself\nto actual conditions,[15] where we, expressed in other words, imitate\nthe succession of objectively real things, so that the images in our\nmind follow after each other in the same strictly causal succession as\nthe historical events outside of our mind.[16]\n\nWe call this thinking, thinking with directed attention. It has, in\naddition, the peculiarity that one is tired by it, and that, on this\naccount, it is set into action only for a time. Our whole vital\naccomplishment, which is so expensive, is adaptation to environment; a\npart of it is the directed thinking, which, biologically expressed, is\nnothing but a process of psychic assimilation, which, as in every vital\naccomplishment, leaves behind a corresponding exhaustion.\n\nThe material with which we think is _language and speech concept_, a\nthing which has been used from time immemorial as something external, a\nbridge for thought, and which has a single purpose—that of\ncommunication. As long as we think directedly, we think for others and\nspeak to others.[17]\n\nSpeech is originally a system of emotional and imitative sounds—sounds\nwhich express terror, fear, anger, love; and sounds which imitate the\nnoises of the elements, the rushing and gurgling of water, the rolling\nof thunder, the tumults of the winds, the tones of the animal world, and\nso on; and, finally, those which represent a combination of the sounds\nof perception and of affective reaction.[18] Likewise in the more or\nless modern languages, large quantities of onomatopoetic relics are\nretained; for example, sounds for the movement of water,—\n\n  Rauschen, risseln, rûschen, rinnen, rennen, to rush, ruscello,\n  ruisseau, river, Rhein.\n\n  Wasser, wissen, wissern, pissen, piscis, fisch.\n\nThus language is originally and essentially nothing but a system of\nsigns or symbols, which denote real occurrences, or their echo in the\nhuman soul.\n\nTherefore one must decidedly agree with Anatole France,[19] when he\nsays,\n\n  “What is thought, and how do we think? We think with words; that alone\n  is sensual and brings us back to nature. Think of it! The\n  metaphysician has only the perfected cry of monkeys and dogs with\n  which to construct the system of the world. That which he calls\n  profound speculation and transcendent method is to put end to end in\n  an arbitrary order the natural sounds which cry out hunger, fear, and\n  love in the primitive forests, and to which were attached little by\n  little the meanings which one believed to be abstract, when they were\n  only crude.\n\n  “Do not fear that the succession of small cries, feeble and stifled,\n  which compose a book of philosophy, will teach us so much regarding\n  the universe, that we can live in it no longer.”\n\nThus is our directed thinking, and even if we were the loneliest and\nfurthest removed from our fellows, this thinking is nothing but the\nfirst notes of a long-drawn-out call to our companions that water had\nbeen found, that we had killed the bear, that a storm was approaching,\nor that wolves were prowling around the camp. A striking paradox of\nAbélard’s which expresses in a very intuitive way the whole human\nlimitation of our complicated thinking process, reads,—“_Sermo generatur\nab intellectu et generat intellectum_.”[20]\n\nAny system of philosophy, no matter how abstract, represents in means\nand purpose nothing more than an extremely cleverly developed\ncombination of original nature sounds.[21] Hence arises the desire of a\nSchopenhauer or a Nietzsche for recognition and understanding, and the\ndespair and bitterness of their loneliness. One might expect, perhaps,\nthat a man full of genius could pasture in the greatness of his own\nthoughts, and renounce the cheap approbation of the crowd which he\ndespises; yet he succumbs to the more powerful impulse of the herd\ninstinct. His searching and his finding, his call, belong to the herd.\n\nWhen I said just now that directed thinking is properly a thinking with\nwords, and quoted that clever testimony of Anatole France as drastic\nproof of it, a misunderstanding might easily arise, namely, that\ndirected thinking is really only “word.” That certainly would go too\nfar. Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider sense than\nthat of speech, which is in itself only the expression of the formulated\nthought which is capable of being communicated in the widest sense.\nOtherwise, the deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity\nfor thinking, which is not the case in reality. Without any knowledge of\nthe spoken word, he has his “language.” This language, considered from\nthe standpoint of history, or in other words, directed thinking, is here\na descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance, Wundt[22]\nexpresses it.\n\n  “A further important result of that co-operation of sound and sign\n  interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually lose\n  altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and turn into\n  signs for general ideas and for the expression of the apperceptive\n  functions of relation and comparison and their products. In this\n  manner abstract thought develops, which, because it would not be\n  possible without the change of meaning lying at the root of it, is\n  indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical reciprocal\n  action out of which the development of language takes place.”\n\nJodl[23] denies the identity of language and thought, because, for one\nreason, one and the same psychic fact might be expressed in different\nlanguages in different ways. From that he draws the conclusion that a\n“super-language thinking” exists. Certainly there is such a thing,\nwhether with Erdmann one considers it “hypologisch,” or with Jodl as\n“super-language.” Only this is not logical thinking. My conception of it\nagrees with the noteworthy contribution made by Baldwin, which I will\nquote here word for word.[24]\n\n  “The transmission from pre-judgmental to judgmental meaning is just\n  that from knowledge which has social confirmation to that which gets\n  along without it. The meanings utilized for judgment are those already\n  developed in their presuppositions and applications through the\n  confirmation of social intercourse. Thus, the personal judgment,\n  trained in the methods of social rendering, and disciplined by the\n  interaction of its social world, projects its content into that world\n  again. In other words, the platform for all movement into the\n  assertion of individual judgment—the level from which new experience\n  is utilized—is already and always socialized; and it is just this\n  movement that we find reflected in the actual results as the sense of\n  the ‘appropriateness’ or synomic character of the meaning rendered.\n\n  “Now the development of thought, as we are to see in more detail, is\n  by a method essentially of trial and error, of experimentation, of the\n  use of meanings as worth more than they are as yet recognized to be\n  worth. The individual must use his own thoughts, his established\n  knowledges, his grounded judgments, for the embodiment of his new\n  inventive constructions. He erects his thought as we say\n  ‘schematically’—in logic terms, ‘problematically,’ conditionally,\n  disjunctively; projecting into the world an opinion still peculiar to\n  himself, as if it were true. _Thus all discovery proceeds._ But this\n  is, from the linguistic point of view, still to use the current\n  language, still to work by meanings already embodied in social and\n  conventional usage.\n\n  “Language grows, therefore, just as thought does, by never losing its\n  synomic or dual reference; its meaning is both personal and social.\n\n  “It is the register of tradition, the record of racial conquest, the\n  deposit of all the gains made by the genius of individuals.... The\n  social copy-system, thus established, reflects the judgmental\n  processes of the race, and in turn becomes the training school of the\n  judgment of new generations.\n\n  “Most of the training of the self, whereby the vagaries of personal\n  reaction to fact and image are reduced to the basis of sound judgment,\n  comes through the use of speech. When the child speaks, he lays before\n  the world his suggestion for a general or common meaning. The\n  reception he gets confirms or refutes him. In either case he is\n  instructed. His next venture is now from a platform of knowledge on\n  which the newer item is more nearly convertible into the common coin\n  of effective intercourse. The point to notice here is not so much the\n  exact mechanism of the exchange—secondary conversion—by which this\n  gain is made, as the training in judgment that the constant use of it\n  affords. In each case, effective judgment is the common judgment.\n\n  “Here the object is to point out that it is secured by the development\n  of a function _whose rise is directly ad hoc_, directly for the social\n  experimentation by which growth in personal competence is advanced as\n  well—_the function of speech_.\n\n  “In language, therefore, to sum up the foregoing, we have the\n  tangible—the actual—the historical—instrument of the development and\n  conservation of psychic meaning. It is the material evidence and proof\n  of the _concurrence of social and personal judgment_. In it synomic\n  meaning, judged as ‘appropriate,’ becomes ‘social’ meaning, held as\n  socially generalized and acknowledged.”",
