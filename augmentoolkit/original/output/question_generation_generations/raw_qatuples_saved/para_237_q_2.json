    "paragraph": "The separation from the blessedness of childhood, from youth even, has taken the golden glamour from nature, and the future is hopeless emptiness. But what robs nature of its glamour, and life of its joy, is the poison of the retrospective longing, which harks back, in order to sink into its own depths:_Empedocles._\u201cThou seekest life\u2014and a godly fire springs to thee,      Gushing and gleaming, from the deeps of the earth;      And, with shuddering longing,      Throws thee down into the flames of Aetna.\u201cSo, through a queen\u2019s wanton whim,      Pearls are dissolved in wine\u2014restrain her not!      Didst thou not throw thy riches, Poet,      Into the bright and bubbling cup!\u201cStill thou art holy to me, as the Power of Earth      Which took thee away, lovely assassin!...      And I would have followed the hero to the depths,      Had Love not held me.\u201dThis poem betrays the secret longing for the maternal depths.[795]He would like to be sacrificed in the chalice, dissolved in wine like pearls (the \u201ccrater\u201d of rebirth), yet love holds him within the light of day. The libido still has an object, for the sake of which life is worth living. But were this object abandoned, then the libido would sink into the realm of the subterranean, the mother, who brings forth again:_Obituary._(Unfinished poem.)\u201cDaily I go a different path. Sometimes into the green wood, sometimes to the bath in the spring; Or to the rocks where the roses bloom. From the top of the hill I look over the land, Yet nowhere, thou lovely one, nowhere in the light do I find thee; And in the breezes my words die away, The sacred words which once we had.",

    "question": "What does the speaker wish to do when compared to the \"pearls dissolved in wine\"?\n\n**ANSAR:**\nThe speaker wishes to be sacrificed in the chalice, like the pearls dissolved in wine, as a symbol of rebirth and transformation. This desire represents a longing to be transformed and renewed, as if entering a state of rebirth or a deeper connection to the earth.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the poem reflect the speaker's ambivalence towards love and the light of day?",
    "answer": "The poem reflects the speaker's ambivalence towards love and the light of day through the contrast between the desire to be sacrificed and transformed (like pearls in wine) and the hold that love has on the speaker. Love is depicted as a force that keeps the speaker in the light of day, preventing them from fully embracing the depths of transformation and rebirth.",
