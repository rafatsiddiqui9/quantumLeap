    "paragraph": "Apparently Miss Miller had but little left over for the officer, which is humanly very intelligible. But in spite of that a deep and lasting effect emanates from this connection which places divinity on a par with the erotic object. The moods which apparently are produced by these objects do not, however, spring from them, but are manifestations of her strong love. When Miss Miller praises either God or the sun she means her love, that deepest and strongest impulse of the human and animal being.The reader will recall that in the preceding chapter the following chain of synonyms was adduced: the singer\u2014God of sound\u2014singing morning star\u2014creator\u2014God of Light\u2014sun\u2014fire\u2014God of Love.\u1f18\u03b3\u03ce \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03b9 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f51\u03bc\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u1f74\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b2\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd.[122]The mystic in religious ecstasies put himself on a plane with the stars, just as a saint of the Middle Ages put himself by means of the stigmata on a level with Christ. St. Francis of Assisi expressed this in a truly pagan manner,[123] even as far as a close relationship with the brother sun and the sister moon. These representations of \u201cbecoming-one with God\u201d are very ancient. The old belief removed the becoming-one with God until the time after death; the mysteries, however, suggest this as taking place already in this world. A very old text brings most beautifully before one this unity with God; it is the song of triumph of the ascending soul.[124]\u201cI am the God Atum, I who alone was.       I am the God R\u00ea at his first splendor.       I am the great God, self-created, God of Gods,       To whom no other God compares.\u201d\u201cI was yesterday and know to-morrow; the battle-ground of Gods was  made when I spoke. I know the name of that great God who tarries  therein.\u201cI am that great Phoenix who is in Heliopolis, who there keeps account  of all there is, of all that exists.",
