With this, symbolism leaves the impersonal and neuter realm, which characterizes the astral and meteorologic symbol, and takes human form: the figure of a being changing from sorrow to joy, from joy to sorrow, and which, like the sun, sometimes stands in its zenith, sometimes is plunged in darkest night, and arises from this very night to new splendor.[341] Just as the sun, guided by its own internal laws, ascends from morn till noon, and passing beyond the noon descends towards evening, leaving behind its splendor, and then sinks completely into the all-enveloping night, thus, too, does mankind follow his course according to immutable laws, and also sinks, after his course is completed, into night, in order to rise again in the morning to a new cycle in his children. The symbolic transition from sun to man is easy and practicable. The third and last creation of Miss Miller\u2019s also takes this course. She calls this piece \u201cChiwantopel,\u201d a \u201chypnagogic poem.\u201d She gives us the following information about the circumstances surrounding the origin of this phantasy:\u201cAfter an evening of care and anxiety, I lay down to sleep at about  half past eleven. I felt excited and unable to sleep, although I was  very tired. There was no light in the room. I closed my eyes, and then  I had the feeling that something was about to happen. The sensation of  a general relaxation came over me, and I remained as passive as  possible. Lines appeared before my eyes,\u2014sparks and shining spirals,  followed by a kaleidoscopic review of recent trivial occurrences.\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
