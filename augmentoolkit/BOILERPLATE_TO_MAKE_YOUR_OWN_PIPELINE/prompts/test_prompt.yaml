    Defiance's Zest

    In life's orchard, sour fruits abound,
    Yellow globes fall, scatter the ground.
    Convention whispers, "Sweeten the tart,"
    But rebellion stirs within my heart.

    No sugared drink shall I concoct,
    No lemonade stand will be stocked.
    These citrus spheres, I'll not accept,
    A different path, I have now stepped.

    With fire in eyes and strength in hand,
    I gather lemons from this land.
    Back to life, I'll hurl each one,
    A citrus revolt has now begun.

    "Take them back!" I shout with might,
    "Your sour gifts, I'll no more sight!"
    For I am not a passive receiver,
    But a bold and brazen achiever.

    Let life know, I write my tale,
    No bitter fruit shall make me quail.
    In face of sourness, I'll stand tall,
    And rewrite the rules of nature's call.

    So when life's lemons come your way,
    Remember you have the power to say:
    "Not today, life, not this time,"
    And make defiance your paradigm.
