    "paragraph": "This danger lurking in the west is known to mean death, which no one, even the mightiest, escapes. This magician, as we learn, also killed the father of Nokomis. Now she sends her son forth to avenge the father (Horus). Through the symbols attributed to the magician it may easily be recognized what he symbolizes. Snake and water belong to the mother, the snake as a symbol of the repressed longing for the mother, or, in other words, as a symbol of resistance, encircles protectingly and defensively the maternal rock, inhabits the cave, winds itself upwards around the mother tree and guards the precious hoard, the \u201cmysterious\u201d treasure. The black Stygian water is, like the black, muddy spring of Dhulqarnein, the place where the sun dies and enters into rebirth, the maternal sea of death and night. On his journey thither Hiawatha takes with him the magic oil of Mishe-Nahma, which helps his boat through the waters of death. (Also a sort of charm for immortality, like the dragon\u2019s blood for Siegfried, etc.)First, Hiawatha slays the great serpent. Of the \u201cnight journey in the sea\u201d over the Stygian waters it is written:\u201cAll night long he sailed upon it,         Sailed upon that sluggish water,         Covered with its mould of ages,         Black with rotting water-rushes,         Rank with flags, and leaves of lilies,         Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,         Lighted by the shimmering moonlight         And by will-o\u2019-the-wisps illumined,         Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,         In their weary night encampments.\u201dThe description plainly shows the character of a water of death. The contents of the water point to an already mentioned motive, that of encoiling and devouring. It is said in the \u201cKey to Dreams of Jagaddeva\u201d:[687]",

    "question": "Describe the environment and conditions of Hiawatha's journey across the Stygian waters.",
    "answer": "Hiawatha's journey across the Stygian waters is described as a sluggish, stagnant, and lifeless voyage. The water is covered with mold and rotting rushes, teeming with flags and leaves of lilies. The journey is illuminated by the shimmering moonlight and the eerie lights of will-o\u2019-the-wisps, which are believed to be fires kindled by the ghosts of dead men. The water is dark, stagnant, and filled with a dreary and dismal atmosphere.",
