Y\u00e2j\u00f1avalkya spake: \u2018He has told thee, they have come from where  all come, who offer up the sacrificial horse. That is to say, this  world extends so far as two and thirty days of the chariot of the Gods  (the sun) reach. This (world) surrounds the earth twice around. This  earth surrounds the ocean twice around. There is, as broad as the edge  of a razor or as the wing of a fly, a space between (the two shells of  the egg of the world). These were brought by Indra as a falcon to the  wind: and the wind took them up into itself and carried them where  were the offerers of the sacrificial horse. Somewhat like this he  spoke (Gandharva to thee) and praised the wind.\u2019\u201cTherefore is the wind the special (vyashti) and the wind the  universal (samashti). He, who knows this, defends himself from dying  again.\u201d\u201cGrata deum matri, siquidem Cybeleius Attis      Exuit hac hominem, truncoque induruit illo.\u201d[823]",
