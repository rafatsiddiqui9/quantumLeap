    "paragraph": "\u201cNow the development of thought, as we are to see in more detail, is  by a method essentially of trial and error, of experimentation, of the  use of meanings as worth more than they are as yet recognized to be  worth. The individual must use his own thoughts, his established  knowledges, his grounded judgments, for the embodiment of his new  inventive constructions. He erects his thought as we say  \u2018schematically\u2019\u2014in logic terms, \u2018problematically,\u2019 conditionally,  disjunctively; projecting into the world an opinion still peculiar to  himself, as if it were true. _Thus all discovery proceeds._ But this  is, from the linguistic point of view, still to use the current  language, still to work by meanings already embodied in social and  conventional usage.\u201cLanguage grows, therefore, just as thought does, by never losing its  synomic or dual reference; its meaning is both personal and social.\u201cIt is the register of tradition, the record of racial conquest, the  deposit of all the gains made by the genius of individuals.... The  social copy-system, thus established, reflects the judgmental  processes of the race, and in turn becomes the training school of the  judgment of new generations.",

    "question": "How does the development of thought occur according to the text?",
    "answer": "The development of thought occurs through a method of trial and error, experimentation, and the use of meanings that are currently worth more than they are recognized to be worth. Individuals must use their established knowledge and judgments to form new inventive constructions, projecting their thoughts as if they were true, even though they are still personal and conditional.",
