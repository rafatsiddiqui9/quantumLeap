    "paragraph": "\u201cI had a contemplation of the sufferings of Christ, and implored him  to let me feel with him his sorrows, and prayed five paternosters to  the honor of the five sacred wounds. Lying on my bed with outstretched  arms, I entered into a great sweetness and into an endless thirst for  the torments of Jesus. Then I saw a light descending upon me: it came  obliquely from above. It was a crucified body, living and transparent,  with arms extended, but without a cross. The wounds shone brighter  than the body; they were five circles of glory, coming forth from the  whole glory. I was enraptured and my heart was moved with great pain  and yet with sweetness from longing to share in the torments of my  Saviour. And my longings for the sorrows of the Redeemer increased  more and more on gazing on his wounds, and passed from my breast,  through my hands, sides and feet to his holy wounds: then from the  hands, then from the sides, then from the feet of the figure threefold  shining red beams ending below in an arrow, shot forth to my hands,  sides and feet.\u201dThe beams, in accordance with the phallic fundamental thought, are threefold, terminating below in an arrow-point.[605] Like Cupid, the sun, too, has its quiver, full of destroying or fertilizing arrows, sun rays,[606] which possess phallic meaning. On this significance evidently rests the Oriental custom of designating brave sons as arrows and javelins of the parents. \u201cTo make sharp arrows\u201d is an Arabian expression for \u201cto generate brave sons.\u201d The Psalms declare (cxxvii:4):\u201cLike as the arrows in the hands of the giant; even so are the young  children.\u201d",

    "question": "What symbolic meaning is attributed to the beams of light that shot forth from Christ's figure to the author's body?",
    "answer": "The beams of light that shot forth from Christ's figure to the author's hands, sides, and feet are described as threefold, terminating below in an arrow-point, which is a reference to phallic symbolism. This symbolizes a connection or transfer of divine energy, much like the arrows of Cupid or the sun rays that can be both destructive and fertilizing.",
