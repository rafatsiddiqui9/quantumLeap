    "paragraph": "When I said just now that directed thinking is properly a thinking with words, and quoted that clever testimony of Anatole France as drastic proof of it, a misunderstanding might easily arise, namely, that directed thinking is really only \u201cword.\u201d That certainly would go too far. Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider sense than that of speech, which is in itself only the expression of the formulated thought which is capable of being communicated in the widest sense. Otherwise, the deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity for thinking, which is not the case in reality. Without any knowledge of the spoken word, he has his \u201clanguage.\u201d This language, considered from the standpoint of history, or in other words, directed thinking, is here a descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance, Wundt[22] expresses it.\u201cA further important result of that co-operation of sound and sign  interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually lose  altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and turn into  signs for general ideas and for the expression of the apperceptive  functions of relation and comparison and their products. In this  manner abstract thought develops, which, because it would not be  possible without the change of meaning lying at the root of it, is  indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical reciprocal  action out of which the development of language takes place.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the author explain the development of abstract thought?\n\n**ANS ANSWER:**\nThe author explains that abstract thought develops through the evolution of language, where many words initially have concrete meanings. Over time, these words can lose their concrete meanings and become symbols for more general ideas and abstract concepts. This transformation is a result of the interaction between sound and sign, leading to the development of abstract thought as a product of psychophysical processes.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does the author suggest is the relationship between sound and sign in the development of language?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the relationship between sound and sign in the development of language is crucial. This co-operation leads to the gradual loss of concrete meanings in words and the emergence of abstract ideas. The change in meaning of words, rooted in the interaction between sound and sign, is described as a fundamental process in the development of language and abstract thought.",
