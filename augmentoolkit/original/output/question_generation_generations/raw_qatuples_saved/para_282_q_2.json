    "paragraph": "This recognition, that man must sacrifice the retrogressive longing (the incestuous libido) before the \u201cheavenly ones\u201d tear away the sacrifice, and at the same time the entire libido, came too late to the poet. Therefore, I take it to be a wise counsel which the unconscious gives our author, to sacrifice the infantile hero. This sacrifice is best accomplished, as is shown by the most obvious meaning, through a complete devotion to life, in which all the libido unconsciously bound up in familial bonds, must be brought outside into human contact. For it is necessary for the well-being of the adult individual, who in his childhood was merely an atom revolving in a rotary system, to become himself the centre of a new system. That such a step implies the solution or, at least, the energetic treatment of the individual sexual problem is obvious, for unless this is done the unemployed libido will inexorably remain fixed in the incestuous bond, and will prevent individual freedom in essential matters. Let us keep in mind that Christ\u2019s teaching separates man from his family without consideration, and in the talk with Nicodemus we saw the specific endeavor of Christ to procure activation of the incest libido. Both tendencies serve the same goal\u2014the liberation of man; the Jew from his extraordinary fixation to the family, which does not imply higher development, but greater weakness and more uncontrolled incestuous feeling, produced the compensation of the compulsory ceremonial of the cult and the religious fear of the incomprehensible Jehovah. When man, terrified by no laws and no furious fanatics or prophets, allows his incestuous libido full play, and does not liberate it for higher purposes, then he is under the influence of unconscious compulsion. For compulsion is the unconscious wish. (Freud.)

    "question": "What is the significance of Christ\u2019s teaching in the context of breaking familial bonds and the liberation of man?\n\n**ANSIG:**\nChrist\u2019s teaching is significant because it separates man from his family without consideration, aiming to activate the incestuous libido for higher purposes. This aligns with the goal of liberating man from his extraordinary fixation on family, which can be a source of weakness and uncontrolled incestuous feelings.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does the text imply about the consequences of allowing the incestuous libido to play freely without higher purpose?",
    "answer": "The text implies that if man allows his incestuous libido to play freely without serving higher purposes, he will be under the influence of unconscious compulsion. This means he is dominated by the libido \u03b5\u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7[803], and his destiny is not in his own hands. He will be under the influence of the unconscious wish and will experience his adventures (\u03a4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9) as dictated by this compulsion.",
