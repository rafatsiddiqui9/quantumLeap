    "paragraph": "This proud sentence, which naturally only a woman can express, because man is not accustomed to boast in that direction, again confirms the fact that all enterprises have remained but dreams, that the body has remained \u201cinviolate.\u201d When the hero visits the heroine in a dream, it is clear what is meant. This assertion of the hero\u2019s, that he has remained inviolate, refers back to the unsuccessful attempt upon his life in the previous chapter (huntsman with the arrow), and clearly explains to us what was really meant by this assault; that is to say, the refusal of the coitus phantasy.

In accordance with this, and in logical continuation of the same, all that follows is expressed in figurative speech.

    "question": "How does the author suggest that excessive pride in remaining unharmed can backfire?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that excessive pride in remaining unharmed can backfire by pointing out that such pride might lead others to think the hero has only engaged in verbal or symbolic combat rather than real, physical conflict. This implies that the hero has not actually faced significant challenges or battles, which could cast doubt on his claims of invincibility.",
