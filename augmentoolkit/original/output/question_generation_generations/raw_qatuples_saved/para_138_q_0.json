    "paragraph": "The subjects of thinking were often astonishingly phantastical; for example, questions were discussed, such as how many angels could have a place on the point of a needle? Whether Christ could have done his work of redemption equally well if he had come into the world as a pea? The possibility of such problems, to which belong the metaphysical problems in general, viz., to be able to know the unknowable, shows us of what peculiar kind that mind must have been which created such things which to us are the height of absurdity. Nietzsche had guessed, however, at the biological background of this phenomenon when he spoke of the \u201cbeautiful tension\u201d of the Germanic mind which the Middle Ages created. Taken historically, scholasticism, in the spirit of which persons of towering intellectual powers, such as Thomas of Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Ab\u00e9lard, William of Occam and others, have labored, is the mother of the modern scientific attitude, and a later time will see clearly how and in what scholasticism still furnishes living undercurrents to the science of to-day. Its whole nature lies in dialectic gymnastics which have raised the symbol of speech, the word, to an almost absolute meaning, so that it finally attained to that substantiality which expiring antiquity could lend to its _logos_ only temporarily, through attributes of mystical valuation. The great work of scholasticism, however, appears to be the foundation of firmly knitted intellectual sublimation, the _conditio sine qua non_ of the modern scientific and technical spirit.",

    "question": "What type of questions were often discussed in the context of scholasticism, and what do these questions reveal about the minds that created them?",
    "answer": "Scholasticism often involved discussing fantastical questions, such as how many angels could fit on the point of a needle or whether Christ could have done his work of redemption equally well if he had come into the world as a pea. These questions reveal that the minds creating them must have been highly imaginative and speculative, as the problems are considered absurd by contemporary standards.",
