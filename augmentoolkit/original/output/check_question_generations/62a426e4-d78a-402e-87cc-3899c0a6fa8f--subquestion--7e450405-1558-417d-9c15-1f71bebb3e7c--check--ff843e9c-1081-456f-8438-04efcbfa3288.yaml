    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ mother. His grandmother, when a maiden, lived in the moon. There she once swung\
    \ upon a liana, but a jealous lover cut off the liana, and Nokomis, Hiawatha’s\
    \ grandmother, fell to earth. The people, who saw her fall downwards, thought\
    \ that she was a _shooting star_. This marvellous descent of Nokomis is more plainly\
    \ illustrated by a later passage of this same song; there little Hiawatha asks\
    \ the grandmother what is the moon. Nokomis teaches him about it as follows: The\
    \ moon is the body of a _grandmother_, whom a warlike grandson has cast up there\
    \ in wrath. Hence the moon is the _grandmother_. In ancient beliefs, the moon\
    \ is also the gathering place of departed souls,[636] the guardian of seeds; therefore,\
    \ once more a place of the origin of life of predominantly feminine significance.\
    \ The remarkable thing is that Nokomis, falling upon the earth, gave birth to\
    \ a daughter, Wenonah, subsequently the mother of Hiawatha. The throwing upwards\
    \ of the mother, and her falling down and bringing forth, seems to contain something\
    \ typical in itself. Thus a story of the seventeenth century relates that a mad\
    \ bull threw a pregnant woman as high as a house, and tore open her womb, and\
    \ the child fell without harm upon the earth. On account of his wonderful birth,\
    \ this child was considered a hero or doer of miracles, but he died at an early\
    \ age. The belief is widespread among lower savages that the sun is feminine and\
    \ the moon masculine. Among the Namaqua, a Hottentot tribe, the opinion is prevalent\
    \ that the sun consists of transparent bacon.“The people, who journey on boats,\
    \ draw it down by magic every  evening, cut off a suitable piece and then give\
    \ it _a kick so that it  flies up again into the sky_.”—_Waitz_: “Anthropologie,”\
