    "paragraph": "We see again in this little myth the typical constituents of the libido myth: original bisexuality, immortality (invulnerability) through entrance into the mother (splitting the mother with the foot, and to become covered up) and resurrection as a bird of the soul and a bringer of fertility (ascending sun). When this type of hero causes his lance to be worshipped, it probably means that his lance is a valid and equivalent expression of himself.From our present standpoint, we understand in a new sense that passage in Job, which I mentioned in Chapter IV of the first part of this book:\u201cHe has set me up for his mark.\u201cHis archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and  doth not spare:\u2014he poureth out my gall upon the ground.\u201cHe breaketh me with breach upon breach: he runneth upon me like a  giant.\u201d\u2014_Job_ xvi:12\u201313\u201314.Now we understand this symbolism as an expression for the soul torment caused by the onslaught of the unconscious desires. The libido festers in his flesh, a cruel god has taken possession of him and pierced him with his painful libidian projectiles, with thoughts, which overwhelmingly pass through him. (As a dementia pr\u00e6cox patient once said to me during his recovery: \u201cTo-day a thought suddenly thrust itself through me.\u201d) This same idea is found again in Nietzsche in Zarathustra:_The Magician_",

    "question": "How does Nietzsche's work, specifically in *Zarathustra*, relate to the concept of the soul being pierced by thoughts?",
    "answer": "Nietzsche's work, specifically in *Zarathustra*, contains a similar concept where thoughts are described as painful and overwhelming, much like being pierced by projectiles. This idea aligns with the text's interpretation of thoughts as painful and intrusive, causing inner torment and a sense of being attacked by one's own mind.",
