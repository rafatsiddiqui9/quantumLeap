{"paragraph": "Miss Miller has an extraordinary faculty for taking other people\u2019s feelings upon herself, and of identification; for example, she identifies herself to such a degree in \u201cCyrano\u201d with the wounded Christian de Neuvillette, that she feels in her own breast a truly piercing pain at that place where Christian received the deadly blow.From the viewpoint of analytic psychology, the theatre, aside from any esthetic value, may be considered as an institution for the treatment of the mass complex. The enjoyment of the comedy, or of the dramatic plot ending happily is produced by an unreserved identification of one\u2019s own complexes with the play. The enjoyment of tragedy lies in the thrilling yet satisfactory feeling that something which might occur to one\u2019s self is happening to another. The sympathy of our author with the dying Christian means that there is in her a complex awaiting a similar solution, which whispers softly to her \u201chodie tibi, cras mihi,\u201d and that one may know exactly what is considered the effectual moment Miss Miller adds that she felt a pain in her breast, \u201cLorsque Sarah Bernhardt se pr\u00e9cipite sur lui pour \u00e9tancher le sang de sa blessure.\u201d Therefore the effectual moment is when the love between Christian and Roxane comes to a sudden end.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
