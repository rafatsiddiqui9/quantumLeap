    "paragraph": "Just as in archaic speech fire and the speech sounds (the mating call, music) appear as forms of emanation of the libido, thus light and sound entering the psyche become one: libido.Manilius expresses it in his beautiful verses:\u201cQuid mirum noscere mundum  Si possunt homines, quibus est et mundus in ipsis  Exemplumque dei quisque est in imagine parva?  An quoquam genitos nisi c\u00e6lo credere fas est  Esse homines?         Stetit unus in arcem  Erectus capitis victorque ad sidera mittit sidereos oculos.\u201d[326]The idea of the Sanskrit _t\u00eajas_ suggests the fundamental significance of the libido for the conception of the world in general. I am indebted to Dr. Abegg, in Zurich, a thorough Sanskrit scholar, for the compilation of the eight meanings of this word._T\u00eajas_ signifies:1. Sharpness, cutting edge.2. Fire, splendor, light, glow, heat.3. Healthy appearance, beauty.4. The fiery and color-producing power of the human organism (thought  to be in the bile).5. Power, energy, vital force.6. Passionate nature.7. Mental, also magic, strength; influence, position, dignity.8. Sperma.This gives us a dim idea of how, for primitive thought, the so-called objective world was, and had to be, a subjective image. To this thought must be applied the words of the \u201cChorus Mysticus\u201d:\u201cAll that is perishable             Is only an allegory.\u201dThe Sanskrit word for fire is _agnis_ (the Latin _ignis_);[327] the fire personified is the god Agni, the divine mediator,[328] whose symbol has certain points of contact with that of Christ. In Avesta and in the Vedas the fire is the messenger of the gods. In the Christian mythology certain parts are closely related with the myth of Agni. Daniel speaks of the three men in the fiery furnace:",

    "question": "What does the term _t\u00eajas_ signify in Sanskrit, and how does it relate to primitive thought?",
    "answer": "The term _t\u00eajas_ in Sanskrit signifies a range of concepts including sharpness, cutting edge, fire, splendor, light, heat, healthy appearance, beauty, the fiery and color-producing power of the human organism, power, energy, vital force, passionate nature, mental and magic strength, influence, position, dignity, and sperma. This range of meanings suggests that for primitive thought, the so-called objective world was a subjective image, and _t\u00eajas_ represents various aspects of the libido and the vital energy that shapes the world.",
