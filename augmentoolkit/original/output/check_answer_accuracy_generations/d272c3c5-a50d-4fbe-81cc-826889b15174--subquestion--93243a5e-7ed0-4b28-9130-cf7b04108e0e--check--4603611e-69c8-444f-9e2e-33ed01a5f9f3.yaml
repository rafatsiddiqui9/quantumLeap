- content: 'Text: """Prepared by the previous chapters, we approach the personification
    of the libido in the form of a conqueror, a hero or a demon. With this, symbolism
    leaves the impersonal and neuter realm, which characterizes the astral and meteorologic
    symbol, and takes human form: the figure of a being changing from sorrow to joy,
    from joy to sorrow, and which, like the sun, sometimes stands in its zenith, sometimes
    is plunged in darkest night, and arises from this very night to new splendor.[341]
    Just as the sun, guided by its own internal laws, ascends from morn till noon,
    and passing beyond the noon descends towards evening, leaving behind its splendor,
    and then sinks completely into the all-enveloping night, thus, too, does mankind
    follow his course according to immutable laws, and also sinks, after his course
    is completed, into night, in order to rise again in the morning to a new cycle
    in his children. The symbolic transition from sun to man is easy and practicable.
    The third and last creation of Miss Miller’s also takes this course. She calls
    this piece “Chiwantopel,” a “hypnagogic poem.” She gives us the following information
    about the circumstances surrounding the origin of this phantasy:“After an evening
    of care and anxiety, I lay down to sleep at about  half past eleven. I felt excited
    and unable to sleep, although I was  very tired. There was no light in the room.
    I closed my eyes, and then  I had the feeling that something was about to happen.
    The sensation of  a general relaxation came over me, and I remained as passive
    as  possible. Lines appeared before my eyes,—sparks and shining spirals,  followed
    by a kaleidoscopic review of recent trivial occurrences.”"""


    Question (based on text): """What is the symbolic transition described from the

    **ANS**:

    The symbolic transition described is from the sun to man, where the sun represents
    the personification of the libido and man represents the collective human experience.
    This transition is considered easy and practicable because it mirrors the natural
    cycle of the sun, which is a familiar and observable phenomenon, making it a straightforward
    metaphor for the broader human cycle.
