Never yet have I found the woman from  whom I wish children, unless she would be this woman whom I love; for  I love thee, O eternity.\u201dH\u00f6lderlin expresses this same longing in a beautiful symbol, the individual traits of which are already familiar to us:\u201c... But soon in a fresh radiance      Mysteriously      Blossoming in golden smoke,      With the rapidly growing steps of the sun,      Making a thousand summits fragrant,      Asia arose!      And, dazzled,      I sought one whom I knew;      For unfamiliar to me were the broad roads,      Where from Tmolus      Comes the gilded Pactol,      And Taurus stands and Messagis\u2014      And the gardens are full of flowers.      But high up in the light      The silvery snow gleams, a silent fire;      And, as a symbol of eternal life,      On the impassable walls,      Grows the ancient ivy.[798]      And carried by columns of living cedars and laurels      Are the solemn, divinely built palaces.\u201dThe symbol is apocalyptic, the maternal city in the land of eternal youth, surrounded by the verdure and flowers of imperishable spring.[799] The poet identifies himself here with John, who lived on Patmos, who was once associated with \u201cthe sun of the Highest,\u201d and saw him face to face:\u201cThere at the Mystery of the Vine they met,    There at the hour of the Holy Feast they gathered,    And\u2014feeling the approach of Death in his great, quiet soul,    The Lord, pouring out his last love, spoke,    And then he died.    Much could be said of it\u2014    How his triumphant glance,    The happiest of all,    Was seen by his companions, even at the last.\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7",
