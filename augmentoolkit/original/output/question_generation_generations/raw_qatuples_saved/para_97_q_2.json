In a transferred sense \u201cnun\u201d was also used for the chaotic primitive waters; in general for the primitive generating matter[488] which was personified by the goddess Nunet. From her Nut sprang, the goddess of heaven, who was represented with a starry body, and also as the heavenly cow with a starry body.When the sun-god, little by little, retires on the back of the heavenly cow, just as poor Lazarus returns into Abraham\u2019s bosom, each has the same significance; they return into the mother, in order to rise as Horus. Thus it can be said that in the morning the goddess is the mother, at noon the sister-wife and in the evening again the mother, who receives the dying in her lap, reminding us of the Piet\u00e0 of Michelangelo. As shown by the illustration (from Dideron\u2019s \u201cIconographie Chr\u00e9tienne\u201d), this thought has been transferred as a whole into Christianity.Thus the fate of Osiris is explained: he passes into the mother\u2019s womb, the chest, the sea, the tree, the column of Astartes; he is dismembered, re-formed, and reappears again in his son, Hor-pi-chrud.",

    "question": "Explain the symbolic significance of the sun-god retiring on the back of the heavenly cow.",
    "answer": "The sun-god's retirement on the back of the heavenly cow symbolizes a return to the mother, much like how Lazarus returns to Abraham's bosom. This signifies the sun-god's return into the mother figure, preparing to rise again as Horus, similar to the dawn of a new day.",
