One of the next and most essential reasons for the energetic\nregression to the infantile in Christianity, which goes hand in hand\nwith the revival of the incest problem, was probably to be found in the\nfar-reaching depreciation of women. At that time sexuality was so easily\nattainable that the result could only be a very excessive depreciation\nof the sexual object. The existence of personal values was first\ndiscovered by Christianity, and there are many people who have not\ndiscovered it even in the present day. However, the depreciation of the\nsexual object hinders the outflow of that libido which cannot be\nsatisfied by sexual activity, because it belongs to an already\ndesexualized higher order. (If it were not so, a Don Juan could never be\nneurotic; but the contrary is the case.) For how might those higher\nvaluations be given to a worthless, despised object? Therefore, the\nlibido, after having seen a “Helen in every woman” for so long a time,\nsets out on a search for the difficult to obtain, the worshipped, but\nperhaps unattainable, goal, and which in the unconscious is the mother.\nTherefore the symbolic needs, based on the incest resistance, arise\nagain in an increased degree, which promptly transforms the beautiful,\nsinful world of the Olympian Gods into incomprehensible, dreamlike, dark\nmysteries, which, with their accessions of symbols and obscure\nmeaningful texts, remove us very far from the religious feelings of that\nRoman-Græco world. When we see how much trouble Jesus took to make\nacceptable to Nicodemus the symbolic perception of things, that is to\nsay, really a repression and veiling over of the actual facts, and how\nimportant it was for the history of civilization in general, that people\nthought and still think in this way, then we understand the revolt which\nis raised everywhere against the psychologic discovery of the true\nbackground of the neurotic or normal symbolism. Always and everywhere we\nencounter the odious realm of sexuality, which represents to all\nrighteous people of to-day something defiled. However, less than 2,000\nyears have passed since the religious cult of sexuality was more or less\nopenly in full bloom. To be sure, they were heathen and did not know\nbetter, but the nature of religious power does not change from cycle to\ncycle. If one has once received an effectual impression of the sexual\ncontents of the ancient cults, and if one realizes oneself that the\nreligious experience, that is, the union[459] with the God of antiquity,\nwas understood by antiquity as a more or less concrete coitus, then\ntruly one can no longer fancy that the motor forces of a religion have\nsuddenly become wholly different since the birth of Christ. Exactly the\nsame thing has occurred as with the hysteric who at first indulges in\nsome quite unbeautiful, infantile sexual manifestations and afterwards\ndevelops a hyperæsthetic negation in order to convince every one of his\nspecial purity. _Christianity, with its repression of the manifest\nsexual, is the negative of the ancient sexual cult._ The original cult\nhas changed its tokens.[460] One only needs to realize how much of the\ngay paganism, even to the inclusion of unseemly Gods, has been taken\ninto the Christian church. Thus the old indecent Priapus celebrated a\ngay festival of resurrection in St. Tychon.[461] Also partly in the\nphysicians Sts. Kosma and Damien, who graciously condescended to accept\nthe “membra virilia” in wax at their festival.[462] St. Phallus of old\nmemories emerges again to be worshipped in country chapels, to say\nnothing of the rest of the paganism!\n\nThere are those who have not yet learned to recognize sexuality as a\nfunction equivalent to hunger and who, therefore, consider it as\ndisgraceful that certain taboo institutions which were considered as\nasexual refuges are now recognized as overflowing with sexual symbolism.\nThose people are doomed to the painful realization that such is still\nthe case, in spite of their great revolt. One must learn to understand\nthat, opposed to the customary habit of thought, psychoanalytic thinking\nreduces and resolves those symbolic structures which have become more\nand more complicated through countless elaboration. This means a course\nof reduction which would be an intellectual enjoyment if the object were\ndifferent. But here it becomes distressing, not only æsthetically, but\napparently also ethically, because the repressions which are to be\novercome have been brought about by our best intentions. We must\ncommence to overcome our virtuousness with the certain fear of falling\ninto baseness on the other side. This is certainly true, for\nvirtuousness is always inwardly compensated by a great tendency towards\nbaseness; and how many profligates are there who inwardly preserve a\nmawkish virtue and moral megalomania? Both categories of men turn out to\nbe snobs when they come in contact with analytic psychology, because the\nmoral man has imagined an objective and cheap verdict on sexuality and\nthe unmoral man is entirely unaware of the vulgarity of his sexuality\nand of his incapacity for an unselfish love. One completely forgets that\none can most miserably be carried away, not only by a vice, but also by\na virtue. There is a fanatic orgiastic self-righteousness which is just\nas base and which entails just as much injustice and violence as a vice.\n\nAt this time, when a large part of mankind is beginning to discard\nChristianity, it is worth while to understand clearly why it was\noriginally accepted. It was accepted in order to escape at last from the\nbrutality of antiquity. As soon as we discard it, licentiousness\nreturns, as impressively exemplified by life in our large modern cities.\nThis step is not a forward step, but a backward one. It is as with\nindividuals who have laid aside one form of transference and have no new\none. Without fail they will occupy regressively the old path of\ntransference, to their great detriment, because the world around them\nhas since then essentially changed. He who is repelled by the historical\nand philosophical weakness of the Christian dogmatism and the religious\nemptiness of an historical Jesus, of whose person we know nothing and\nwhose religious value is partly Talmudic, partly Hellenic wisdom, and\ndiscards Christianity, and therewith Christian morality, is certainly\nconfronted with the ancient problem of licentiousness. To-day the\nindividual still feels himself restrained by the public hypocritical\nopinion, and, therefore, prefers to lead a secret, separate life, but\npublicly to represent morality. It might be different if men in general\nall at once found the moral mask too dull, and if they realized how\ndangerously their beasts lie in wait for each other, and then truly a\nfrenzy of demoralization might sweep over humanity. This is the dream,\nthe wish dream, of the morally limited man of to-day; he forgets\nnecessity, which strangles men and robs them of their breath, and which\nwith a stern hand interrupts every passion.\n\nIt must not be imputed to me that I am wishing to refer the libido back\nby analytical reduction to the primitive, almost conquered, stages,\nentirely forgetting the fearful misery this would entail for humanity.\nIndeed, some individuals would let themselves be transported by the\nold-time frenzy of sexuality, from which the burden of guilt has been\nremoved, to their own greatest detriment.\n\nBut these are the ones who under other circumstances would have\nprematurely perished in some other way. However, I well know the most\neffectual and most inexorable regulator of human sexuality. This is\nnecessity. With this leaden weight human lust will never fly too high.\n\nTo-day there are countless neurotics who are so simply because they do\nnot know how to seek happiness in their own manner. They do not even\nrealize where the lack lies. And besides these neurotics there are many\nmore normal people—and precisely people of the higher type—who feel\nrestricted and discontented. For all these reduction to the sexual\nelements should be undertaken, in order that they may be reinstated into\nthe possession of their primitive self, and thereby learn to know and\nvalue its relation to the entire personality. In this way alone can\ncertain requirements be fulfilled and others be repudiated as unfit\nbecause of their infantile character. In this way the individual will\ncome to realize that certain things are to be sacrificed, although they\nare accomplished, _but in another sphere_. We imagine that we have long\nrenounced, sacrificed and cut off our incest wish, and that nothing of\nit is left. But it does not occur to us that this is not true, but that\nwe unconsciously commit incest in another territory. In religious\nsymbols, for example, we come across incest.[463] We consider the\nincestuous wish vanished and lost, and then rediscover it in full force\nin religion. This process or transformation has taken place\nunconsciously in secular development. Just as in Part I it is shown that\na similar unconscious transformation of the libido is an ethically\nworthless pose, and with which I compared the Christianity of early\nRoman antiquity, where evidently licentiousness and brutality were\nstrongly resisted, so here I must remark in regard to the sublimation of\nthe incestuous libido, that the belief in the religious symbol has\nceased to be an ethical ideal; but it is an unconscious transformation\nof the incest wish into symbolic acts and symbolic concepts which cheat\nmen, as it were, so that heaven appears to them as a father and earth as\na mother and the people upon it children and brothers and sisters. Thus\nman can remain a child for all time and satisfy his incest wish all\nunawares. This state would doubtless be ideal[464] if it were not\ninfantile and, therefore, merely a one-sided wish, which maintains a\nchildish attitude. _The reverse is anxiety._ Much is said of pious\npeople who remain unshaken in their trust in God and wander unswervingly\nsafe and blessed through the world. I have never seen this Chidher yet.\nIt is probably a wish figure. The rule is great uncertainty among\nbelievers, which they drown with fanatical cries among themselves or\namong others; moreover, they have religious doubts, moral uncertainty,\ndoubts of their own personality, feelings of guilt and, deepest of all,\ngreat fear of the opposite aspect of reality, against which the most\nhighly intelligent people struggle with all their force. This other side\nis the devil, the adversary or, expressed in modern terms, the\ncorrective of reality, of the infantile world picture, which has been\nmade acceptable through the predominating pleasure principle.[465] But\nthe world is not a garden of God, of the Father, but a place of terrors.\nNot only is heaven no father and earth no mother and the people not\nbrothers nor sisters, but they represent hostile, destroying powers, to\nwhich we are abandoned the more surely, the more childishly and\nthoughtlessly we have entrusted ourselves to the so-called Fatherly hand\nof God. One should never forget the harsh speech of the first Napoleon,\nthat the good God is always on the side of the heaviest artillery.\n\nThe religious myth meets us here as one of the greatest and most\nsignificant human institutions which, despite misleading symbols,\nnevertheless gives man assurance and strength, so that he may not be\noverwhelmed by the monsters of the universe. The symbol, considered from\nthe standpoint of actual truth, is misleading, indeed, but it is\n_psychologically true_,[466] because it was and is the bridge to all the\ngreatest achievements of humanity.\n\nBut this does not mean to say that this unconscious way of\ntransformation of the incest wish into religious exercises is the only\none or the only possible one. There is also a conscious recognition and\nunderstanding with which we can take possession of this libido which is\nbound up in incest and transformed into religious exercises so that we\nno longer need the stage of religious symbolism for this end. It is\nthinkable that instead of doing good to our fellow-men, for “the love of\nChrist,” we do it from the knowledge that humanity, even as ourselves,\ncould not exist if, among the herd, the one could not sacrifice himself\nfor the other. _This would be the course of moral autonomy, of perfect\nfreedom, when man could without compulsion wish that which he must do,\nand this from knowledge, without delusion through belief in the\nreligious symbols._\n\nIt is a positive creed which keeps us infantile and, therefore,\nethically inferior. Although of the greatest significance from the\ncultural point of view and of imperishable beauty from the æsthetic\nstandpoint, this delusion can no longer ethically suffice humanity\nstriving after moral autonomy.\n\nThe infantile and moral danger lies in belief in the symbol because\nthrough that we guide the libido to an imaginary reality. The simple\nnegation of the symbol changes nothing, for the entire mental\ndisposition remains the same; we merely remove the dangerous object. But\nthe object is not dangerous; the danger is our own infantile mental\nstate, for love of which we have lost something very beautiful and\ningenious through the simple abandonment of the religious symbol. I\nthink _belief should be replaced by understanding_; then we would keep\nthe beauty of the symbol, but still remain free from the depressing\nresults of submission to belief. This would be the psychoanalytic cure\nfor belief and disbelief.",
