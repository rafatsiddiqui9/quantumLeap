    "paragraph": "The symbolism which Freud has discovered, is revealed as an expression of a thinking and of an impulse limited to the dream, to wrong conduct, and to derangements of the mind, which form of thinking and impulse at one time ruled as the mightiest influence in past culture epochs.The question of _whence_ comes the inclination and ability which enables the mind to express itself symbolically, brings us to the distinction between the two kinds of thinking\u2014the directed and adapted on one hand, and the subjective, fed by our own egotistic wishes, on the other. The latter form of thinking, presupposing that it were not constantly corrected by the adapted thinking, must necessarily produce an overwhelmingly subjectively distorted idea of the world. We regard this state of mind as infantile. It lies in our individual past, and in the past of mankind.",

    "question": "How does the author differentiate between two kinds of thinking?",
    "answer": "The author differentiates between two kinds of thinking: directed and adapted thinking on one hand, and subjective, ego-driven thinking on the other. Directed and adapted thinking is considered more rational and corrected by societal norms, whereas subjective thinking, if not corrected, leads to a distorted view of the world.",
