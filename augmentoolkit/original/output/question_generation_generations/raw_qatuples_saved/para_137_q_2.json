    "paragraph": "\u201cWhat was hidden in the shell,     Was born through the power of fiery torments.     From this first arose love,     As the germ of knowledge,     The wise found the roots of existence in non-existence,     By investigating the hearts impulses.\u201d[768]This philosophical view interprets the world as an emanation of the libido, and this must be widely accepted from the theoretic as well as the psychologic standpoint, for the function of reality is an instinctive function, having the character of biological adaptation. When the insane Schreber brought about the end of the world through his libido-introversion, he expressed an entirely rational psychologic view, just as Schopenhauer wished to abolish through negation (holiness, asceticism) the error of the primal will, through which the world was created. Does not Goethe say:\u201cYou follow a false trail;         Do not think that we are not serious;         Is not the kernel of nature         In the hearts of men?\u201dThe hero, who is to accomplish the rejuvenation of the world and the conquest of death, is the libido, which, brooding upon itself in introversion, coiling as a snake around its own egg, apparently threatens life with a poisonous bite, in order to lead it to death, and from that darkness, conquering itself, gives birth to itself again. Nietzsche knows this conception:[769]\u201cHow long have you sat already upon your misfortune.      Give heed! lest you hatch an egg,      A basilisk egg      Of your long travail.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about Goethe's understanding of the kernel of nature?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that Goethe understood the kernel of nature to be found in the hearts of men. This aligns with the idea that the fundamental aspects of nature are deeply intertwined with human emotions and psychological processes, reflecting the broader philosophical view that the world is an emanation of the libido.",
