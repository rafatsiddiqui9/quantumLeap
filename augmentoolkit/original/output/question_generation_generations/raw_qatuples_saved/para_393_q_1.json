    "paragraph": "The condition of transference among brothers is to be such as between man and Christ, a spiritual one. As the history of ancient cults and certain Christian sects shows, this explanation of the Christian religion is an especially important one biologically, for the psychologic intimacy creates certain shortened ways between men which lead only too easily to that from which Christianity seeks to release them, namely to the sexual relation with all those consequences and necessities under which the really already highly civilized man had to suffer at the beginning of our Christian era. For just as the ancient religious experience was regarded distinctly as a bodily union with the Deity,[88] just so was worship permeated with sexuality of every kind. Sexuality lay only too close to the relations of people with each other. The moral degeneracy of the first Christian century produced a moral reaction arising out of the darkness of the lowest strata of society which was expressed in the second and third centuries at its purest in the two antagonistic religions, Christianity on the one side, and Mithracism on the other. These religions strove after precisely that higher form of social intercourse symbolic of a projected \u201cbecome flesh\u201d idea (logos), whereby all those strongest impulsive energies of the archaic man, formerly plunging him from one passion into another,[89] and which seemed to the ancients like the compulsion of the evil constellations, as \u03b5\u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7,[90] and which in the sense of later ages might be translated as the driving force of the libido,[91] the \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae[92] of Zeno, could be made use of for social preservation.[93]",

    "question": "How does the text explain the prevalence of sexuality in ancient religious practices and worship?",
    "answer": "The text explains that ancient religious practices and worship were permeated with sexuality of every kind, as ancient religious experience was distinctly regarded as a bodily union with the Deity. This indicates that sexuality was closely intertwined with the relationships between people and their divine counterparts, highlighting the historical context where religious and sexual boundaries were often blurred.",
