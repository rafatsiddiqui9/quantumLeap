Pealing rays and trumpet-blazes,        Eye is blinded, ear amazes;        The Unheard can no one hear!        Slip within each blossom-bell,        Deeper, deeper, there to dwell,\u2014        In the rocks, beneath the leaf!        If it strikes you, you are deaf.\u201d                     \u2014_Faust._ Part II.We also must not forget the beautiful verse of H\u00f6lderlin:\u201cWhere art thou? Drunken, my soul dreams       Of all thy rapture. Yet even now I hearken       As full of golden tones the radiant sun youth       Upon his heavenly lyre plays his even song       To the echoing woods and hills.\u201d",
