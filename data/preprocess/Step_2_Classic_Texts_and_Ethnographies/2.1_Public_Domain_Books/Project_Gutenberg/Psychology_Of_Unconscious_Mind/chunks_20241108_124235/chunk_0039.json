One must again think of the Indians at this point, who say the\nfirst people proceeded from the sword-hilt and a shuttle. The religious\nthought is bound up with the compulsion to call the mother no longer\nmother, but City, Source, Sea, etc. This compulsion can be derived from\nthe need to manifest an amount of libido bound up with the mother, but\nin such a way that the mother is represented by or concealed in a\nsymbol. The symbolism of the city we find well-developed in the\nrevelations of John, where two cities play a great part, one of which is\ninsulted and cursed by him, the other greatly desired. We read in\nRevelation (xvii:1):\n\n  (1) “Come hither: I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great\n  whore that sitteth on many waters.\n\n  (2) “With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and\n  the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her\n  fornication.\n\n  (3) “So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I\n  saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of the names of\n  blasphemy, and having seven heads and ten horns.\n\n  (4) “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colors, and\n  decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden\n  cup[432] in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her\n  fornication.\n\n  (5) “And upon her forehead was a name written: _Mystery. Babylon the\n  great. The Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth._\n\n  (6) “And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of saints, and with\n  the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her I wondered with\n  a great admiration.”\n\nHere follows an interpretation of the vision unintelligible to us, from\nwhich we can only emphasize the point that the seven heads[433] of the\ndragon means the seven hills upon which the woman sits. This is probably\na distinct allusion to Rome, the city whose temporal power oppressed the\nworld at the time of the Revelation. The waters upon which the woman\n“the mother” sits are “peoples and throngs and nations and tongues.”\nThis also seems to refer to Rome, for she is the mother of peoples and\npossessed all lands. Just as in common speech, for example, colonies are\ncalled daughters, so the people subject to Rome are like members of a\nfamily subject to the mother. In another version of the picture, the\nkings of the people, namely, the fathers, commit fornication with this\nmother. Revelation continues (xviii: 2):\n\n  (2) “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the\n  Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,\n  and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and\n  hateful bird.\n\n  (3) “For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her\n  fornication.”\n\nThus this mother does not only become the mother of all abominations,\nbut also in truth the receptacle of all that is wicked and unclean. The\nbirds are images of souls;[434] therefore, this means all souls of the\ncondemned and evil spirits. Thus the mother becomes Hecate, the\nunderworld, the City of the damned itself. We recognize easily in the\nancient idea of the woman on the dragon,[435] the above-mentioned\nrepresentation of Echnida, the mother of the infernal horrors. Babylon\nis the idea of the “terrible” mother, who seduces all people to whoredom\nwith devilish temptation, and makes them drunk with her wine. The\nintoxicating drink stands in the closest relation to fornication, for it\nis also a libido symbol, as we have already seen in the parallel of fire\nand sun. After the fall and curse of Babylon, we find in Revelation\n(xix:6–7) the hymn which leads from the under half to the upper half of\nthe mother, where now everything is possible which would be impossible\nwithout the repression of incest:\n\n  (6) “Alleluia, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.\n\n  (7) “Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the\n  marriage of the Lamb is come,[436] and his wife hath made herself\n  ready.\n\n  (8) “And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,\n  clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.\n\n  (9) “And he saith unto me, ‘Write, Blessed are they which are called\n  unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.’”\n\nThe Lamb is the son of man who celebrates his marriage with the “woman.”\nWho the “woman” is remains obscure at first. But Revelation (xxi:9)\nshows us which “woman” is the bride, the Lamb’s wife:\n\n  (9) “Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.[437]\n\n  (10) “And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high\n  mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,\n  descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.”\n\nIt is evident from this quotation, after all that goes before, that the\nCity, the heavenly bride, who is here promised to the Son, is the\nmother.[438] In Babylon the impure maid was cast out, according to the\nEpistle to the Galatians, so that here in heavenly Jerusalem the\nmother-bride may be attained the more surely. It bears witness to the\nmost delicate psychologic perception that the fathers of the church who\nformulated the canons preserved this bit of the symbolic significance of\nthe Christ mystery. It is a treasure house for the phantasies and myth\nmaterials which underlie primitive Christianity.[439] The further\nattributes which were heaped upon the heavenly Jerusalem make its\nsignificance as mother overwhelmingly clear:\n\n  (1) “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,\n  proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.\n\n  (2) “In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the\n  river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits,\n  and yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for\n  the healing of nations.\n\n  (3) “And there shall be no more curse.”\n\nIn this quotation we come upon the symbol of the waters, which we found\nin the mention of Ogyges in connection with the city. The maternal\nsignificance of water belongs to the clearest symbolism in the realm of\nmythology,[440] so that the ancients could say: ἠ θάλασσα—τῆς γενέσεως\nσύμβολον.[441] From water comes life;[442] therefore, of the two gods\nwhich here interest us the most, Christ and Mithra, the latter was born\nbeside a river, according to representations, while Christ experienced\nhis new birth in the Jordan; moreover, he is born from the Πηγή,[443]\nthe “sempiterni fons amoris,” the mother of God, who by the\nheathen-Christian legend was made a nymph of the Spring. The “Spring” is\nalso found in Mithracism. A Pannonian dedication reads, “Fonti perenni.”\nAn inscription in Apulia is dedicated to the “Fons Aeterni.” In Persia,\nArdvîçûra is the well of the water of life. Ardvîçûra-Anahita is a\ngoddess of water and love (just as Aphrodite is born from foam). The\nneo-Persians designate the Planet Venus and a nubile girl by the name\n“Nahid.” In the temples of Anaitis there existed prostitute Hierodules\n(harlots). In the Sakaeen (in honor of Anaitis) there, occurred ritual\ncombats as in the festival of the Egyptian Ares and his mother. In the\nVedas the waters are called Mâtritamâh—the most maternal.[443] All that\nis living rises as does the sun, from the water, and at evening plunges\ninto the water. Born from the springs, the rivers, the seas, at death\nman arrives at the waters of the Styx in order to enter upon the “night\njourney on the sea.” The wish is that the black water of death might be\nthe water of life; that death, with its cold embrace, might be the\nmother’s womb, just as the sea devours the sun, but brings it forth\nagain out of the maternal womb (Jonah motive[444]). Life believes not in\ndeath.\n\n            “In the flood of life, in the torrent of deeds,\n            I toss up and down,\n            I am blown to and fro!\n            Cradle and grave,\n            An eternal sea;\n            A changing web,\n            A glowing life.”          —_Goethe: Faust._\n\nThat ξύλον ζωῆς, the wood of life, or the tree of life, is a maternal\nsymbol would seem to follow from the previous deductions. The etymologic\nconnection of ὕο, ὕλε, υἱός, in the Indo-Germanic root suggests the\nblending of the meanings in the underlying symbolism of mother and of\ngeneration. The tree of life is probably, first of all, a fruit-bearing\ngenealogical tree, that is, a mother-image. Countless myths prove the\nderivation of man from trees; many myths show how the hero is enclosed\nin the maternal tree—thus dead Osiris in the column, Adonis in the\nmyrtle, etc. Numerous female divinities were worshipped as trees, from\nwhich resulted the cult of the holy groves and trees. It is of\ntransparent significance when Attis castrates himself under a pine tree,\ni. e. he does it because of the mother. Goddesses were often worshipped\nin the form of a tree or of a wood. Thus Juno of Thespiæ was a branch of\na tree, Juno of Samos was a board. Juno of Argos was a column. The\nCarian Diana was an uncut piece of wood. Athene of Lindus was a polished\ncolumn. Tertullian calls Ceres of Pharos “rudis palus et informe lignum\nsine effigie.” Athenaeus remarks of Latona at Dalos that she is ξὐλινον\nἄμορφον, a shapeless piece of wood.[445] Tertullian calls an Attic\nPallas “crucis stipes,” a wooden pale or mast. The wooden pale is\nphallic, as the name suggests, φάλης, Pallus. The φαλλός is a pale, a\nceremonial lingam carved out of figwood, as are all Roman statues of\nPriapus. Φάλος means a projection or centrepiece on the helmet, later\ncalled κῶνος just as ἀναφαλ-αντίασις signifies baldheadedness on the\nforepart of the head, and φαλακρός signifies baldheadedness in regard to\nthe φάλος-κῶνος of the helmet; a semi-phallic meaning is given to the\nupper part of the head as well.[446] Φάλληνος has, besides φαλλός, the\nsignificance of “wooden”; φαλ-άγγωμα, “cylinder”; φάλαγξ, “a round\nbeam.” The Macedonian battle array, distinguished by its powerful\nimpetus, is called φάλαγξ; moreover, the finger-joint[447] is called\nφάλαγξ. φάλλαινα or φάλαινα is a whale. Now φαλός appears with the\nmeaning “shining, brilliant.” The Indo-Germanic root is _bhale_ = to\nbulge, to swell.[448] Who does not think of Faust?\n\n              “It grows, it shines, increases in my hand!”\n\nThat is primitive libido symbolism, which shows how immediate is the\nconnection between phallic libido and light. The same relations are\nfound in the Rigveda in Rudra’s utterances.\n\n  _Rigveda_ 1, 114, 3:\n\n  “May we obtain your favor, thou man ruling, Oh urinating Rudra.”\n\nI refer here to the previously mentioned phallic symbolism of Rudra in\nthe Upanishads:\n\n  (4) “We call for help below to the flaming Rudra, to the one bringing\n  the sacrifice; him who encircles and wanders (wandering in the vault\n  of Heaven) to the seer.”\n\n  2, 33, 5:",
