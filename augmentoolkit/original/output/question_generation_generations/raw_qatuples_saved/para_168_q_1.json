    "paragraph": " After longer or shorter tarryings of the libido at these stations, it passes onward until it reaches the sexual zone, and there, for the first time, can be occasion for the beginning of onanistic attempts. In its migration the libido takes more than a little of the function of nutrition with it into the sexual zone, which readily accounts for the numerous and innate correlations between the functions of nutrition and sexuality. If, after the occupation of the sexual zone, an obstacle arises against the present form of application of the libido, then there occurs, according to the well-known laws, a regression to the nearest station lying behind, to the two above-mentioned periods. It is now of special importance that the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity coincides in a general way with the time of the development of the mind and of speech. I might designate the period from birth until the occupation of the sexual zone as the presexual stage of development. This generally occurs between the third and fifth year, and is comparable to the chrysalis stage in butterflies. It is distinguished by the irregular commingling of the elements of nutrition and of sexual functions. Certain regressions follow directly back to the presexual stage, and, judging from my experience, this seems to be the rule in the regression of dementia pr\u00e6cox. I will give two brief examples. One case concerns a young girl who developed a catatonic state during her engagement. When she saw me for the first time, she came up suddenly, embraced me, and said, \u201cPapa, give me something to eat.\u201d The other case concerns a young maidservant who complained that people pursued her with electricity and that this caused a queer feeling in her genitals, \u201cas if it ate and drank down there.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the libido's journey to the sexual zone influence the correlation between nutrition and sexuality?",
    "answer": "As the libido migrates to the sexual zone, it takes along some of the function of nutrition. This explains the numerous and innate correlations between the functions of nutrition and sexuality.",
