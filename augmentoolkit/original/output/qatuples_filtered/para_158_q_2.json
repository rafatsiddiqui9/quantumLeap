    "paragraph": "The serpent symbolism of the Last Supper is explained by the identification of the hero with the serpent: The god is buried in the mother: as fruit of the field, as food coming from the mother and at the same time as drink of immortality he is received by the mystic, or as a serpent he unites with the mystic. All these symbols represent the liberation of the libido from the incestuous fixation through which new life is attained. The liberation is accomplished under symbols, which represent the activity of the incest wish.It might be justifiable at this place to cast a glance upon psychoanalysis as a method of treatment. In practical analysis it is important, first of all, to discover the libido lost from the control of consciousness. (It often happens to the libido as with the fish of Moses in the Mohammedan legend; it sometimes \u201ctakes its course in a marvellous manner into the sea.\u201d) Freud says in his important article, \u201cZur Dynamik der \u00dcbertragung\u201d:[784]\u201cThe libido has retreated into regression and again revives the  infantile images.\u201dThis means, mythologically, that the sun is devoured by the serpent of the night, the treasure is concealed and guarded by the dragon: substitution of a present mode of adaptation by an infantile mode, which is represented by the corresponding neurotic symptoms. Freud continues:\u201cThither the analytic treatment follows it and endeavors to seek out  the libido again, to render it accessible to consciousness, and  finally to make it serviceable to reality. Whenever the analytic  investigation touches upon the libido, withdrawn into its  hiding-place, a struggle must break out; all the forces, which have  caused the regression of the libido, will rise up as resistance  against the work, in order to preserve this new condition.\u201d",

    "question": "How does psychoanalysis treat the issue of the libido's regression and loss?",
    "answer": "In psychoanalysis, the primary goal is to discover the libido that has lost control of consciousness, much like a fish in the legend of Moses. The analytic treatment aims to locate and bring the libido back into conscious awareness, making it useful for reality. This process involves a struggle against resistance, as the forces that caused the regression of the libido seek to maintain the new regressed state.",
