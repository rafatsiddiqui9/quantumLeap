  "original_text": "As has already been shown above, the libido in youthful individuals at\nfirst manifests itself in the nutritional zone, when food is taken in\nthe act of suckling with rhythmic movements and with every sign of\nsatisfaction. With the growth of the individual and the development of\nhis organs the libido creates for itself new avenues to supply its need\nof activity and satisfaction. The primary model of rhythmic activity,\nproducing pleasure and satisfaction, must now be transferred to the zone\nof other functions, with sexuality as its final goal. A considerable\npart of the “hunger libido” is transferred into the “sexual libido.”\nThis transition does not take place suddenly at the time of puberty, as\nis generally supposed, but very gradually in the course of the greater\npart of childhood. The libido can free itself only with difficulty and\nvery slowly from that which is peculiar to the function of nutrition, in\norder to enter into the peculiarity of the sexual function. Two periods\nare to be distinguished in this state of transition, so far as I can\njudge—_the epoch of suckling and the epoch of the displaced rhythmic\nactivity_. Suckling still belongs to the function of nutrition, but\npasses beyond it, however, in that it is no longer the function of\nnutrition, but rhythmic activity, with pleasure and satisfaction as a\ngoal, without the taking of nourishment. Here the hand enters as an\nauxiliary organ. In the period of the displaced rhythmic activity the\nhand appears still more clearly as an auxiliary organ; the gaining of\npleasure leaves the mouth zone and turns to other regions. The\npossibilities are now many. As a rule, other openings of the body become\nthe objects of the libido interest; then the skin, and special portions\nof that. The activity expressed in these parts, which can appear as\nrubbing, boring, picking, and so on, follows a certain rhythm and serves\nto produce pleasure. After longer or shorter tarryings of the libido at\nthese stations, it passes onward until it reaches the sexual zone, and\nthere, for the first time, can be occasion for the beginning of\nonanistic attempts. In its migration the libido takes more than a little\nof the function of nutrition with it into the sexual zone, which readily\naccounts for the numerous and innate correlations between the functions\nof nutrition and sexuality. If, after the occupation of the sexual zone,\nan obstacle arises against the present form of application of the\nlibido, then there occurs, according to the well-known laws, a\nregression to the nearest station lying behind, to the two\nabove-mentioned periods. It is now of special importance that the epoch\nof the displaced rhythmic activity coincides in a general way with the\ntime of the development of the mind and of speech. I might designate the\nperiod from birth until the occupation of the sexual zone as the\npresexual stage of development. This generally occurs between the third\nand fifth year, and is comparable to the chrysalis stage in butterflies.\nIt is distinguished by the irregular commingling of the elements of\nnutrition and of sexual functions. Certain regressions follow directly\nback to the presexual stage, and, judging from my experience, this seems\nto be the rule in the regression of dementia præcox. I will give two\nbrief examples. One case concerns a young girl who developed a catatonic\nstate during her engagement. When she saw me for the first time, she\ncame up suddenly, embraced me, and said, “Papa, give me something to\neat.” The other case concerns a young maidservant who complained that\npeople pursued her with electricity and that this caused a queer feeling\nin her genitals, “as if it ate and drank down there.”\n\nThese regressive phenomena show that even from the distance of the\nmodern mind those early stages of the libido can be regressively\nreached. One may assume, therefore, that in the earliest states of human\ndevelopment this road was much more easily travelled than it is to-day.\nIt becomes then a matter of great interest to learn whether traces of\nthis have been preserved in history.\n\nWe owe our knowledge of the ethnologic phantasy of boring to the\nvaluable work of Abraham,[282] who also refers us to the writings of\nAdalbert Kuhn.[283] Through this investigation we learn that Prometheus,\nthe fire-bringer, may be a brother of the Hindoo Pramantha, that is to\nsay, of the masculine fire-rubbing piece of wood. The Hindoo\nfire-bringer is called Mâtariçvan, and the activity of the fire\npreparation is always designated in the hieratic text by the verb\n“manthâmi,”[284] which means _shaking_, _rubbing_, _bringing forth by\nrubbing_. Kuhn has put this verb in connection with the Greek μανθάνω,\nwhich means “to learn,” and has explained this conceptual\nrelationship.[285] The “tertium comparationis” might lie in the rhythm,\nthe movement to and fro in the mind. According to Kuhn, the root “manth”\nor “math” must be traced from μανθάνω (μάθημα, μάθησις) to προ-μηθέομαι\nto Προμηθεύς,[286] who is the Greek fire-robber. Through an unauthorized\nSanskrit word “pramâthyus,” which comes by way of “pramantha,” and which\npossesses the double meaning of “Rubber” and “Robber,” the transition to\nPrometheus was effected. With that, however, the prefix “pra” caused\nspecial difficulty, so that the whole derivation was doubted by a series\nof authors, and was held, in part, as erroneous. On the other hand, it\nwas pointed out that as the Thuric Zeus bore the especially interesting\ncognomen Προ-μανθεύς, thus Προ-μηθεύς might not be an original\nIndo-Germanic stem word that was related to the Sanskrit “pramantha,”\nbut might represent only a cognomen. This interpretation is supported by\na gloss of Hesychius, Ἰθάς: ὁ τῶν Τιτάνων κήρυξ Προμηθεύς.[287] Another\ngloss of Hesychius explains ἰθαίνομαι (ιαίνω) as θερμαίνομαι, through\nwhich Ἰθάς attains the meaning of “the flaming one,” analogous to Αἴθων\nor Φλεγύας.[288] The relation of Prometheus to pramantha could scarcely\nbe so direct as Kuhn conjectures. The question of an indirect relation\nis not decided with that. Above all, Προμηθεύς is of great significance\nas a surname for Ἰθάς, since the “flaming one” is the “fore-thinker.”\n(_Pramati_ = precaution is also an attribute of Agni, although _pramati_\nis of another derivation.) Prometheus, however, belongs to the line of\nPhlegians which was placed by Kuhn in uncontested relationship to the\nIndian priest family of Bhṛgu.[289] The Bhṛgu are like Mâtariçvan (the\n“one swelling in the mother”), also fire-bringers. Kuhn quotes a\npassage, according to which Bhṛgu also arises from the flame like Agni.\n(“In the flame Bhṛgu originated. Bhṛgu roasted, but did not burn.”) This\nview leads to a root related to Bhṛgu, that is to say, to the Sanskrit\n_bhrây_ = to light, Latin _fulgeo_ and Greek φλέγω (Sanskrit _bhargas_ =\nsplendor, Latin _fulgur_). Bhṛgu appears, therefore, as “the shining\none.” Φλεγύας means a certain species of eagle, on account of its\nburnished gold color. The connection with φλέγειν, which signifies “to\nburn,” is clear. The Phlegians are also the fire eagles.[290] Prometheus\nalso belongs to the Phlegians. The path from Pramantha to Prometheus\npasses not through the word, but through the idea, and, therefore, we\nshould adopt this same meaning for Prometheus as that which Pramantha\nattains from the Hindoo fire symbolism.[291]\n\nThe Pramantha, as the tool of Manthana (the fire sacrifice), is\nconsidered purely sexual in the Hindoo; the Pramantha as phallus, or\nman; the bored wood underneath as vulva, or woman.[292] The resulting\nfire is the child, the divine son Agni. The two pieces of wood are\ncalled in the cult Purûravas and Urvaçî, and were thought of personified\nas man and woman. The fire was born from the genitals of the woman.[293]\nAn especially interesting representation of fire production, as a\nreligious ceremony (manthana), is given by Weber:[294]\n\n  “A certain sacrificial fire was lit by the rubbing together of two\n  sticks; one piece of wood is taken up with the words: ‘Thou art the\n  birthplace of the fire,’ and two blades of grass are placed upon it;\n  ‘Ye are the two testicles,’ to the ‘adhârarani’ (the underlying wood):\n  ‘Thou art Urvaçî’; then the utarârani (that which is placed on top) is\n  anointed with butter. ‘Thou art Power.’ This is then placed on the\n  adhârarani. ‘Thou art Purûravas’ and both are rubbed three times. ‘I\n  rub thee with the Gâyatrîmetrum: I rub thee with the Trishtubhmeṭrum:\n  I rub thee with the Jagatîmetrum.’”\n\nThe sexual symbolism of this fire production is unmistakable. We see\nhere also the rhythm, the metre in its original place as sexual rhythm,\nrising above the mating call into music. A song of the Rigveda[295]\nconveys the same interpretation and symbolism:\n\n “Here is the gear for function, here tinder made ready for the spark.\n Bring thou the matron:[296] we will rub Agni in ancient fashion forth.\n In the two fire-sticks Jâtavedas lieth, even as the well-formed germ in\n    pregnant women;\n Agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with\n    oblations;\n Lay this with care on that which lies extended: straight hath she borne\n    the steer when made prolific.\n\n With his red pillar—radiant in his splendor—in our skilled task is born\n    the son of Ilâ.”[297]—_Book III._ xxix: 1–3.\n\nSide by side with the unequivocal coitus symbolism we see that the\nPramantha is also Agni, the created son. The Phallus is the son, or the\nson is the Phallus. Therefore, Agni in the Vedic mythology has the\nthreefold character. With this we are once more connected with the\nabove-mentioned Cabiric Father-Son-Cult. In the modern German language\nwe have preserved echoes of the primitive symbols. A boy is designated\nas “bengel” (short, thick piece of wood). In Hessian as “stift” or\n“bolzen” (arrow,[298] wooden peg or stump). The Artemisia Abrotanum,\nwhich is called in German “Stabwurz” (stick root), is called in English\n“Boy’s Love.” (The vulgar designation of the penis as “boy” was remarked\neven by Grimm and others.) The ceremonial production of fire was\nretained in Europe as late as the nineteenth century as a superstitious\ncustom. Kuhn mentions such a case even in the year 1828, which occurred\nin Germany. The solemn, magic ceremony was called the “Nodfyr”—“The fire\nof need”[299]—and the charm was chiefly used against cattle epidemics.\nKuhn cites from the chronicle of Lanercost of the year 1268 an\nespecially noteworthy case of the “Nodfyr,”[300] the ceremonies of which\nplainly reveal the fundamental phallic meaning:\n\n  “Pro fidei divinæ integritate servanda recolat lector, quod cum hoc\n  anno in Laodonia pestis grassaretur in pecudes armenti, quam vocant\n  usetati Lungessouht, quidam bestiales, habitu claustrales non animo,\n  docebant idiotas patriæ ignem confrictione de lignis educere et\n  simulacrum Priapi statuere, et per hæc bestiis succurrere. Quod cum\n  unus laicus Cisterciensis apud Fentone fecisset ante atrium aulæ, ac\n  intinctis testiculis canis in aquam benedictam super animalis\n  sparsisset, etc.”[301]",
