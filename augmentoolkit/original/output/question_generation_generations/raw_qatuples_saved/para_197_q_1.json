    "paragraph": "Chiwantopel\u2019s prophecy is a repetition of Longfellow\u2019s \u201cHiawatha,\u201d where the poet could not escape sentimentality, and at the close of the career of the hero, Hiawatha, he brings in the Savior of the white people, in the guise of the arriving illustrious representatives of the Christian religion and morals. (One thinks of the work of redemption of the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru!) With this prophecy of Chiwantopel, the personality of the author is again placed in the closest relation to the hero, and, indeed, as the real object of Chiwantopel\u2019s longing. Most certainly the hero would have married her, had she lived at his time; but, unfortunately, she comes too late. The connection proves our previous assertion that the libido moves round in a circle. The author loves herself; that is to say, she, as the hero, is sought by one who comes too late. This motive of coming too late is characteristic of the infantile love: the father and the mother cannot be overtaken. The separation of the two personalities by ten thousand moons is a wish fulfilment; with that the incest relation is annulled in an effectual manner. This white heroine will seek without being understood. (She is not understood, because she cannot understand herself rightly.) And she will not find. But in dreams, at least, they will find each other, \u201cand she will understand.\u201d The next sentence of the text reads:\u201cI have kept my body inviolate.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the motif of \"coming too late\" signify in the context of the hero's and Chiwantopel\u2019s relationship?",
    "answer": "The motif of \"coming too late\" in the context of the hero's and Chiwantopel\u2019s relationship signifies an infantile love scenario, where the hero cannot catch up with Chiwantopel. This motif is characteristic of early stages of romantic development, where the loved one is often seen as untouchable or unreachable.",
