    "paragraph": "Let us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom of boring. Let us imagine a strong adult man carrying on the boring with two pieces of wood with the same perseverance and the energy corresponding to that of this child. He may very easily create fire by this play. But of greatest significance in this work is the rhythm.[307] This hypothesis seems to me psychologically possible, although it should not be said with this that only in this way could the discovery of fire occur. It can result just as well by the striking together of flints. It is scarcely possible that fire was created in only one way. All I want to establish here is merely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications of which point to the possibility that in such a way was fire invented or prepared.",

    "question": "Can you think of another method that could have led to the discovery of fire, besides the rhythmic rubbing of wood?",
    "answer": "Another method that could have led to the discovery of fire is the striking together of flints. When flints are struck against each other, they can produce sparks, which can then be used to ignite materials and create fire.",
