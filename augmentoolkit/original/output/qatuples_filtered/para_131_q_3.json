    "paragraph": "\u201cYe intrepid ones around me! solve for me the riddle which I saw, make  clear to me the vision of the lonesomest one.\u201cFor it was a vision and a prophecy; what did then I behold in  parable? And who is it who is still to come?\u201cWho is the shepherd into whose mouth crept the snake? Who is the man  into whose throat all the heaviness and the blackest would creep?[762]\u201cBut the shepherd bit, as my cry had told him; he bit with a huge  bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent\u2014and sprang up.\u201cNo longer shepherd, no longer man, a transfigured being, an  illuminated being, who laughed! Never yet on earth did a man laugh as  he laughed!\u201cO my brethren, I heard a laugh which was no human laughter\u2014and now a  thirst consumeth me, a longing that is never allayed.\u201cMy longing for this laugh eats into me. Oh, how can I suffer still to  live! And how now can I bear to die!\u201d[763]The snake represents the introverting libido. Through introversion one is fertilized, inspired, regenerated and reborn from the God. In Hindoo philosophy this idea of creative, intellectual activity has even cosmogenic significance. The unknown original creator of all things is, according to Rigveda 10, 121, Praj\u00e2pati, the \u201cLord of Creation.\u201d In the various Brahmas, his cosmogenic activity was depicted in the following manner\u201cPraj\u00e2pati desired: \u2018I will procreate myself, I will be manifold.\u2019 He  performed Tapas; after he had performed Tapas he created these  worlds.\u201d",

    "question": "Describe the transformation that occurs when one engages in introversion according to the passage.",
    "answer": "When one engages in introversion, as symbolized by the shepherd biting the serpent's head, the process involves being fertilized, inspired, regenerated, and reborn from the divine. This transformation leads to a transcendent and illuminated state, where one becomes a transfigured being and experiences a profound and joyful laugh, unlike any human laughter before. This transformation is portrayed as a birth from the divine, representing a higher form of creation and rebirth.",
