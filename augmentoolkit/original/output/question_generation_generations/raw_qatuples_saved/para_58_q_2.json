    "paragraph": "At Siegfried\u2019s birth Sieglinde dies, as is proper. The foster-mother[700] is apparently not a woman, but a chthonic god, a crippled dwarf, who belongs to that tribe which renounces love.[701] The Egyptian god of the underworld, the crippled shadow of Osiris (who celebrated a melancholy resurrection in the sexless semi-ape Harpocrates), is the tutor of Horus, who has to avenge the death of his father.Meanwhile Brunhilde sleeps the enchanted sleep, like a Hierosgamos, upon a mountain, where Wotan has put her to sleep[702] with the magic thorn (Edda), surrounded by the flames of Wotan\u2019s fire (equal to libido[703]), which wards off every one. But Mime becomes Siegfried\u2019s enemy and wills his death through Fafner. Here Mime\u2019s dynamic nature is revealed; he is a masculine representation of the terrible mother, also a foster-mother of demoniac nature, who places the poisonous worm (Typhon) in her son\u2019s (Horus\u2019s) path. Siegfried\u2019s longing for the mother drives him away from Mime, and his travels begin with the mother of death, and lead through vanquishing the \u201cterrible mother\u201d[704] to the woman:_Siegfried_:Off with the imp!         I ne\u2019er would see him more!         Might I but know what my mother was like         That will my thought never tell me!         Her eyes\u2019 tender light         Surely did shine         Like the soft eyes of the doe!Siegfried decides to separate from the demon which was the mother in the past, and he gropes forward with the longing directed towards the mother. Nature acquires a hidden maternal significance for him (\u201cdoe\u201d); in the tones of nature he discovers a suggestion of the maternal voice and the maternal language:_Siegfried_:",
