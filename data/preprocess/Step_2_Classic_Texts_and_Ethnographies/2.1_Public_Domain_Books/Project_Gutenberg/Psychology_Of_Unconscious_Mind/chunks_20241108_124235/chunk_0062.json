The bread which we break, is it not the communion of\n  the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body; for\n  we are all partakers of one bread.”—_I Corinthians_ x: 16, 17.\n\nBread and wine are the body and the blood of Christ; the food of the\nimmortals who are brothers with Christ, ἀδελφοί, those who come from the\nsame womb. We who are reborn again from the mother are all heroes\ntogether with Christ, and enjoy immortal food. As with the Jews, so too\nwith the Christians, there is imminent danger of unworthy partaking, for\nthis mystery, which is very closely related psychologically with the\nsubterranean Hierosgamos of Eleusis, involves a mysterious union of man\nin a spiritual sense,[751] which was constantly misunderstood by the\nprofane and was retranslated into his language, where mystery is\nequivalent to orgy and secrecy to vice.[752] A very interesting\nblasphemer and sectarian of the beginning of the nineteenth century\nnamed Unternährer has made the following comment on the last supper:\n\n  “The communion of the devil is in this brothel. All they sacrifice\n  here, they sacrifice to the devil and not to God. There they have the\n  devil’s cup and the devil’s dish; _there they have sucked the head of\n  the snake_,[753] there they have fed upon the iniquitous bread and\n  drunken the wine of wickedness.”[754]\n\nUnternährer is an adherent or a forerunner of the “theory of living\none’s own nature.” He dreams of himself as a sort of priapic divinity;\nhe says of himself:\n\n  “Black-haired, very charming and handsome in countenance, and every\n  one enjoys listening to thee on account of the amiable speeches which\n  come from thy mouth; therefore the maids love thee.”\n\nHe preaches “the cult of nakedness.”\n\n  “Ye fools and blind men, behold God has created man in his image, as\n  male and female, and has blessed them and said, ‘Be fruitful and\n  multiply and fill the earth, and make it subject to thee.’ Therefore,\n  he has given the greatest honor to these poor members and has placed\n  them naked in the garden,” etc.\n\n  “Now are the fig leaves and the covering removed, because thou hast\n  turned to the Lord, for the Lord is the Spirit, and where the spirit\n  of the Lord is, there is freedom,[755] there the clearness of the Lord\n  is mirrored with uncovered countenance. This is precious before God,\n  and this is the glory of the Lord, and the adornment of our God, when\n  you stand in the image and honor of your God, as God created you,\n  naked and not ashamed.\n\n  “Who can ever praise sufficiently in the sons and daughters of the\n  living God those parts of the body which are destined to procreate?\n\n  “In the lap of the daughters of Jerusalem is the gate of the Lord, and\n  the Just will go into the temple there, to the altar.[756] And in the\n  lap of the sons of the living God is the water-pipe of the upper part,\n  which is a tube, like a rod, to measure the temple and altar. And\n  under the water-tube the sacred stones are placed, as a sign and\n  testimony of the Lord, who has taken to himself the seed of Abraham.\n\n  “Out of the seeds in the chamber of the mother, God creates a man with\n  his hands, as an image of himself. Then the mother house and the\n  mother chamber is opened in the daughters of the Living God, and God\n  himself brings forth a child through them. Thus God creates children\n  from the stones, for the seed comes from the stones.”[757]\n\nHistory teaches in manifold examples how the religious mysteries are\nliable to change suddenly into sexual orgies because they have\noriginated from an overvaluation of the orgy. It is characteristic that\nthis priapic divinity[758] returns again to the old symbol of the snake,\nwhich in the mystery enters into the faithful, fertilizing and\nspiritualizing them, although it originally possessed a phallic\nsignificance. In the mysteries of the Ophites, the festival was really\ncelebrated with serpents, in which the animals were even kissed.\n(Compare the caressing of the snake of Demeter in the Eleusinian\nmysteries.) In the sexual orgies of the modern Christian sects the\nphallic kiss plays a very important rôle. Unternährer was an\nuncultivated, crazy peasant, and it is unlikely that the Ophitic\nreligious ceremonies were known to him.\n\nThe phallic significance is expressed negatively or mysteriously through\nthe serpent, which always points to a secret related thought. This\nrelated thought connects with the mother; thus, in a dream a patient\nfound the following imagery: “A serpent shot out from a moist cave and\nbit the dreamer in the region of the genitals.” This dream took place at\nthe instant when the patient was convinced of the truth of the analysis,\nand began to free himself from the bond of his mother complex. The\nmeaning is: I am convinced that I am inspired and poisoned by the\nmother. The contrary manner of expression is characteristic of the\ndream. At the moment when he felt the impulse to go forwards he\nperceived the attachment to the mother. Another patient had the\nfollowing dream during a relapse, in which the libido was again wholly\nintroverted for a time: “She was entirely filled within by a great\nsnake; only one end of the tail peeped out from her arm. She wanted to\nseize it, but it escaped her.” A patient with a very strong introversion\n(catatonic state) complained to me that a snake was stuck in her\nthroat.[759] This symbolism is also used by Nietzsche in the “vision” of\nthe shepherd and the snake:[760]\n\n  “And verily, what I saw was like nothing I ever saw before. I saw a\n  young shepherd, writhing, choking, twitching with a convulsed face,\n  from whose mouth hung a black, heavy serpent.\n\n  “Did I ever see so much disgust and pallid fear upon a\n  countenance?[761] Might he have been sleeping, and the snake crept\n  into his mouth—there it bit him fast?\n\n  “My hand tore at the serpent and tore—in vain!—I failed to tear the\n  serpent out of his mouth. Then there cried out of me: ‘Bite! Bite! Its\n  head off! Bite!’ I exclaimed; all my horror, my hate, my disgust, my\n  compassion, all the good and bad cried out from me in one voice.\n\n  “Ye intrepid ones around me! solve for me the riddle which I saw, make\n  clear to me the vision of the lonesomest one.\n\n  “For it was a vision and a prophecy; what did then I behold in\n  parable? And who is it who is still to come?\n\n  “Who is the shepherd into whose mouth crept the snake? Who is the man\n  into whose throat all the heaviness and the blackest would creep?[762]\n\n  “But the shepherd bit, as my cry had told him; he bit with a huge\n  bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent—and sprang up.\n\n  “No longer shepherd, no longer man, a transfigured being, an\n  illuminated being, who laughed! Never yet on earth did a man laugh as\n  he laughed!\n\n  “O my brethren, I heard a laugh which was no human laughter—and now a\n  thirst consumeth me, a longing that is never allayed.\n\n  “My longing for this laugh eats into me. Oh, how can I suffer still to\n  live! And how now can I bear to die!”[763]\n\nThe snake represents the introverting libido. Through introversion one\nis fertilized, inspired, regenerated and reborn from the God. In Hindoo\nphilosophy this idea of creative, intellectual activity has even\ncosmogenic significance. The unknown original creator of all things is,\naccording to Rigveda 10, 121, Prajâpati, the “Lord of Creation.” In the\nvarious Brahmas, his cosmogenic activity was depicted in the following\nmanner\n\n  “Prajâpati desired: ‘I will procreate myself, I will be manifold.’ He\n  performed Tapas; after he had performed Tapas he created these\n  worlds.”\n\nThe strange conception of Tapas is to be translated, according to\nDeussen,[764] as “he heated himself with his own heat,[765] with the\nsense of ‘he brooded, he hatched.’” Here the hatcher and the hatched are\nnot two, but one and the same identical being. As Hiranyagarbha,\nPrajâpati is the egg produced from himself, the world-egg, from which he\nhatches himself. He creeps into himself, he becomes his own uterus,\nbecomes pregnant with himself, in order to give birth to the world of\nmultiplicity. Thus Prajâpati through the way of introversion changed\ninto something new, the multiplicity of the world. It is of especial\ninterest to note how the most remote things come into contact. Deussen\nobserves:\n\n  “In the degree that the conception of Tapas (heat) becomes in hot\n  India the symbol of exertion and distress, the ‘tapo atapyata’ began\n  to assume the meaning of self-castigation and became related to the\n  idea that creation is an act of _self-renunciation_ on the part of the\n  Creator.”\n\nSelf-incubation and self-castigation and introversion are very closely\nconnected ideas.[766] The Zosimos vision mentioned above betrays the\nsame train of thought, where it is said of the place of transformation:\nὁ τόπος τῆς ἀσκήσεως.[767] We have already observed that the place of\ntransformation is really the uterus. Absorption in one’s self\n(introversion) is an entrance into one’s own uterus, and also at the\nsame time asceticism. In the philosophy of the Brahmans the world arose\nfrom this activity; among the post-Christian Gnostics it produced the\nrevival and spiritual rebirth of the individual, who was born into a new\nspiritual world. The Hindoo philosophy is considerably more daring and\nlogical, and assumes that creation results from introversion in general,\nas in the wonderful hymn of Rigveda, 10, 29, it is said:\n\n        “What was hidden in the shell,\n        Was born through the power of fiery torments.\n        From this first arose love,\n        As the germ of knowledge,\n        The wise found the roots of existence in non-existence,\n        By investigating the hearts impulses.”[768]\n\nThis philosophical view interprets the world as an emanation of the\nlibido, and this must be widely accepted from the theoretic as well as\nthe psychologic standpoint, for the function of reality is an\ninstinctive function, having the character of biological adaptation.\nWhen the insane Schreber brought about the end of the world through his\nlibido-introversion, he expressed an entirely rational psychologic view,\njust as Schopenhauer wished to abolish through negation (holiness,\nasceticism) the error of the primal will, through which the world was\ncreated. Does not Goethe say:\n\n                 “You follow a false trail;\n                 Do not think that we are not serious;\n                 Is not the kernel of nature\n                 In the hearts of men?”\n\nThe hero, who is to accomplish the rejuvenation of the world and the\nconquest of death, is the libido, which, brooding upon itself in\nintroversion, coiling as a snake around its own egg, apparently\nthreatens life with a poisonous bite, in order to lead it to death, and\nfrom that darkness, conquering itself, gives birth to itself again.\nNietzsche knows this conception:[769]\n\n          “How long have you sat already upon your misfortune.\n          Give heed! lest you hatch an egg,\n          A basilisk egg\n          Of your long travail.”\n\nThe hero is himself a serpent, himself a sacrificer and a sacrificed.\nThe hero himself is of _serpent nature_; therefore, Christ compares\nhimself with the serpent; therefore, the redeeming principle of the\nworld of that Gnostic sect which styled itself the Ophite was the\nserpent. The serpent is the Agatho and Kako demon. It is, indeed,\nintelligible, when, in the Germanic saga, they say that the heroes had\nserpents’ eyes.[770] I recall the parallel previously drawn between the\neyes of the Son of man and those of the Tarpeian dragon. In the already\nmentioned mediæval pictures, the dragon, instead of the Lord, appeared\nin the cup; the dragon who with changeful, serpent glances[771] guarded\nthe divine mystery of renewed rebirth in the maternal womb. In Nietzsche\nthe old, apparently long extinct idea is again revived:[772]",
