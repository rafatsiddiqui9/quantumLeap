    "paragraph": "This is not torment which comes from without, which befalls mankind; but that he himself is the hunter, murderer, sacrificer and sacrificial knife is shown us in another of Nietzsche\u2019s poems, wherein the apparent dualism is transformed into the soul conflict through the use of the same symbolism:\u201cOh, Zarathustra,         Most cruel Nimrod!         Whilom hunter of God         The snare of all virtue,         An arrow of evil!         Now         Hunted by thyself         Thine own prey         Pierced through thyself,         Now         Alone with thee         Twofold in thine own knowledge         Mid a hundred mirrors         False to thyself,         Mid a hundred memories         Uncertain         Ailing with each wound         Shivering with each frost         Caught in thine own snares,         Self knower!         Self hangman!\u201cWhy didst thou strangle thyself         With the noose of thy wisdom?         Why hast thou enticed thyself         Into the Paradise of the old serpent?         Why hast thou crept         Into thyself, thyself?...\u201d",

    "question": "What does the \"soul conflict\" metaphor in the poem suggest about Zarathustra's internal state?",
    "answer": "The \"soul conflict\" metaphor suggests that Zarathustra is internally torn and conflicted. It implies that he is not just acting as an external hunter but is also the subject of his own hunting, indicating a deep-seated struggle within himself.",
