    "paragraph": "The power of God is threatened by the seduction of passion; a second fall of angels menaces heaven. Let us translate this mythologic projection back into the psychologic, from whence it originated. Then it would read: the power of the good and reasonable ruling the world wisely is threatened by the chaotic primitive power of passion; therefore passion must be exterminated; that is to say, projected into mythology. The race of Cain and the whole sinful world must be destroyed from the roots by the deluge. It is the inevitable result of that sinful passion which has broken through all barriers. Its counterpart is the sea and the waters of the deep and the floods of rain,[191] the generating, fructifying and \u201cmaternal waters,\u201d as the Indian mythology refers to them. Now they leave their natural bounds and surge over the mountain tops, engulfing all living things; for passion destroys itself. The libido is God and Devil. With the destruction of the sinfulness of the libido an essential portion of the libido would be destroyed. Through the loss of the Devil, God himself suffered a considerable loss, somewhat like an amputation upon the body of the Divinity. The mysterious hint in Raphael\u2019s lament concerning the two rebels, Samiasa and Azaziel, suggests this.\u201c... Why,        Cannot this earth be made, or be destroyed,        Without involving ever some vast void        In the immortal ranks?...\u201d",

    "question": "How is passion viewed in this context, and what is the suggested solution?",
    "answer": "Passion is viewed as a chaotic and primitive force that threatens the wise ruling of the world. The suggested solution is to exterminate passion, which is translated into the mythological idea of projecting passion into the sinful world, leading to its destruction through a deluge.",
