In this significance the black horse, Apaosha, the demon of opposition, appears in the old Persian song, Tishtriya, where it obstructs the sources of the rain lake. The white horse Tishtriya makes two futile attempts to vanquish Apaosha; at the third attempt, with the help of Ahuramazda, he is successful.[543] Whereupon the sluices of heaven open and a fruitful rain pours down upon the earth.[544] In this song one sees very beautifully in the choice of symbol how libido is opposed to libido, will against will, the discordance of primitive man with himself, which he recognizes again in all the adversity and contrasts of external nature.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What are the two primary meanings attributed to the dragon in the text?", "answer": "The dragon is attributed with two primary meanings: the symbolic representation of a treasure guardian and defender, and a symbol of the sexual neutral (or bisexual) libido, which is a symbol of the _libido in opposition_.", "question_group_id": "2139f276-22f6-4034-aa43-4a6467572161", "paragraph_idx": 1, "question_idx": 2}
