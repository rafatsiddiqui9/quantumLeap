The act of defecation is often designated as \u201cto pop.\u201d A joking name for the posterior part is \u201cthe bum.\u201d (Poop also means the rear end of a ship.) In French, _pouf!_ is onomatopoetic; _pouffer_ = _platzen_ (to explode), _la poupe_ = rear end of ship, _le poupard_ = the baby in arms, _la poup\u00e9e_ = doll. _Poupon_ is a pet name for a chubby-faced child. In Dutch _pop_, German _Puppe_ and Latin _puppis_ = doll; in Plautus, however, it is also used jokingly for the posterior part of the body; _pupus_ means child; _pupula_ = girl, little dollie. The Greek word \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c0\u03cd\u03b6\u03c9 designates a cracking, snapping or blowing sound. It is used of kissing; by Theocritus also of the associated noise of flute blowing. The etymologic parallels show a remarkable relationship between the part of the body in question and the child. This relationship we will mention here, only to let it drop at once, as this question will claim our attention later.",
