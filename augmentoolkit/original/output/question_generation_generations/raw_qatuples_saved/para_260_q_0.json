    "paragraph": "Before we enter upon Miss Miller\u2019s attempt to bring to light through her suppositions[64] the root of this subliminal creation, we will attempt a short analytic survey of the material already in our possession. The impression on the ship has already been properly emphasized, so that we need have no further difficulty in gaining possession of the dynamic process which brought about this poetical revelation. It was made clear in the preceding paragraphs that Miss Miller possibly had not inconsiderably undervalued the importance of the erotic impression. This assumption gains in probability through experience, which shows that, very generally, relatively weak erotic impressions are greatly undervalued. One can see this best in cases where those concerned, either from social or moral grounds, consider an erotic relation as something quite impossible; for example, parents and children, brothers and sisters, relations (homosexual) between older and younger men, and so on. If the impression is relatively slight, then it does not exist at all for the participators; if the impression is strong, then a tragic dependence arises, which may result in some great nonsense, or be carried to any extent. This lack of understanding can go unbelievably far; mothers, who see the first erections of the small son in their own bed, a sister who half-playfully embraces her brother, a twenty-year-old daughter who still seats herself on her father\u2019s lap, and then has \u201cstrange\u201d sensations in her \u201cabdomen.\u201d They are all morally indignant to the highest degree if one speaks of \u201csexuality.\u201d Finally, our whole education is carried on with the tacit agreement to know as little as possible of the erotic, and to spread abroad the deepest ignorance in regard to it. It is no wonder, therefore, that the judgment, _in puncto_, of the importance of an erotic impression is generally unsafe and inadequate.",

    "question": "What does the passage suggest about the importance of erotic impressions and how they are perceived by individuals?",
    "answer": "The passage suggests that erotic impressions can be greatly undervalued, especially when they are relatively weak. This undervaluation is evident in various social or moral contexts, such as between parents and children, siblings, and older and younger men in a homosexual relationship. Even when the impressions are strong, they can lead to significant and potentially harmful outcomes, such as tragic dependencies or misunderstandings. Generally, there is a tacit agreement in society to know little about sexuality and to foster deep ignorance about it. This contributes to unsafe and inadequate judgments about the importance of erotic impressions.",
