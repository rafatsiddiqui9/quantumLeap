{"paragraph": "“In the flood of life, in the torrent of deeds,       I toss up and down,       I am blown to and fro!       Cradle and grave,       An eternal sea;       A changing web,       A glowing life.”     —_Goethe: Faust._“It grows, it shines, increases in my hand!”That is primitive libido symbolism, which shows how immediate is the connection between phallic libido and light. The same relations are found in the Rigveda in Rudra’s utterances._Rigveda_ 1, 114, 3:“May we obtain your favor, thou man ruling, Oh urinating Rudra.”I refer here to the previously mentioned phallic symbolism of Rudra in the Upanishads:(4) “We call for help below to the flaming Rudra, to the one bringing  the sacrifice; him who encircles and wanders (wandering in the vault  of Heaven) to the seer.”2, 33, 5:“He who opens up the sweet, who listens to our calls, the ruddy one,  with the beautiful helmet, may he not give us over to the powers of  jealousy.(6) “I have been rejoiced by the bull connected with Marut, the  supplicating one with strong force of life.(8) “Sound the powerful song of praise to the ruddy bull to the white  shining one; worship the flaming one with honor, we sing of the  shining being Rudra.“May Rudra’s missile (arrow) not be used on us, may the great  displeasure of the shining one pass us by: Unbend the firm (bow or  hard arrow?) for the princes, thou who blessest with the waters of thy  body (generative strength), be gracious to our children and  grandchildren.”[449]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What are the specific requests made to Rudra in the Rigveda verses 1.112.1 to 1.112.7?", "answer": "The Rigveda verses 1.112.1 to 1.112.7 specifically ask Rudra not to use his missile (arrow) on them and to not inflict great displeasure.
