    "paragraph": "\u201cThe dream seemed to me to come from a mixture of the representation  of \u2018Paradise Lost,\u2019 \u2018Job,\u2019 and \u2018Creation,\u2019 with ideas such as \u2018thought  which spontaneously produces its object\u2019: \u2018the gift of love,\u2019 \u2018chaos,  and cosmos.\u2019\u201dIn the same way as colored splinters of glass are combined in a kaleidoscope, in her mind fragments of philosophy, \u00e6sthetics and religion would seem to be combined\u2014\u201cunder the stimulating influence of the journey, and the countries  hurriedly seen, combined with the great silence and the indescribable  charm of the sea. \u2018Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus.\u2019 \u2018Only this,  and nothing more!\u2019\u201dWith these words, Miss Miller shows us out, politely and energetically. Her parting words in her negation, confirmed over again in English, leave behind a curiosity; viz., what position is to be negated by these words? \u201cCe ne fut que cela et rien de plus\u201d\u2014that is to say, really, only \u201cle charme impalpable de la mer\u201d\u2014and the young man who sang melodiously during the night watch is long since forgotten, and no one is to know, least of all the dreamer, that he was a morning star, who came before the creation of a new day.[79] One should take care lest he satisfy himself and the reader with a sentence such as \u201cce ne fut que cela.\u201d Otherwise, it might immediately happen that one would become disturbed again. This occurs to Miss Miller too, since she allowed an English quotation to follow,\u2014\u201cOnly this, and nothing more,\u201d without giving the source, it is true. The quotation comes from an unusually effective poem, \u201cThe Raven\u201d by Poe. The line referred to occurs in the following:\u201cWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door\u2014   \u2018\u2019Tis some visitor.\u2019 I muttered, \u2018tapping at my chamber door\u2019\u2014             Only this, and nothing more.\u201d",
