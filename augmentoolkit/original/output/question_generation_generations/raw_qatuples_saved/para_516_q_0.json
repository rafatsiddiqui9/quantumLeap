    "paragraph": "Honegger discovered the following hallucination in an insane man (paranoid dement): The patient sees in the sun an \u201cupright tail\u201d similar to an erected penis. When he moves his head back and forth, then, too, the sun\u2019s penis sways back and forth in a like manner, and out of that the wind arises. This strange hallucination remained unintelligible to us for a long time until I became acquainted with the Mithraic liturgy and its visions. This hallucination threw an illuminating light, as it appears to me, upon a very obscure place in the text which immediately follows the passage previously cited:\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03bb\u03af\u03b2\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f37\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd. \u1f18\u1f70\u03bd \u1f96  \u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03c0\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f41 \u1f15\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7  \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f44\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u1f70\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2.Mead translates this very clearly:[158]\u201cAnd towards the regions westward, as though it were an infinite  Eastwind. But if the other wind, towards the regions of the East,  should be in service, in the like fashion shalt thou see towards the  regions of that side the converse of the sight.\u201dIn the original \u1f45\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 is the vision, the thing seen. \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac means properly the carrying away. The sense of the text, according to this, might be: the thing seen may be carried or turned sometimes here, sometimes there, according to the direction of the wind. The \u1f45\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 is the tube, \u201cthe place of origin of the wind,\u201d which turns sometimes to the east, sometimes to the west, and, one might add, generates the corresponding wind. The vision of the insane man coincides astonishingly with this description of the movement of the tube.[159]The various attributes of the sun, separated into a series, appear one after the other in the Mithraic liturgy. According to the vision of Helios, seven maidens appear with the heads of snakes, and seven gods with the heads of black bulls.",

    "question": "What hallucination did Honegger observe in a patient, and how did it relate to the movement of the sun in the sky?",
    "answer": "Honegger observed that a patient saw the sun as having an \"upright tail\" resembling an erected penis. When the patient moved his head, the \"penis\" of the sun moved in a similar manner, and this was associated with the origin of the wind. This hallucination was later connected to the Mithraic liturgy and its descriptions of wind directions.",
