    "paragraph": "\u201cMy tongue lacks words, and what happens in me my spirit sees clearly  but does not explain. It sees the invisible, that emptiness of all  forms, simple throughout, not complex, and in extent infinite. For it  sees no beginning, and it sees no end. It is entirely unconscious of  the meanings, and does not know what to call that which it sees.  Something complete appears, it seems to me, not indeed through the  being itself, but through a participation. For you enkindle fire from  fire, and you receive the whole fire; but this remains undiminished  and undivided, as before. Similarly, that which is divided separates  itself from the first; and like something corporeal spreads itself  into several lights. This, however, is something spiritual,  immeasurable, indivisible, and inexhaustible. For it is not separated  when it becomes many, but remains undivided and is in me, and enters  within my poor heart like a sun or circular disc of the sun, similar  to the light, for it is a light.\u201d[136]That that thing, perceived as inner light, as the sun of the other world, is longing, is clearly shown by Symeon\u2019s words:[137]",

    "answer": "The narrator perceives an invisible, formless emptiness that is simple, infinite, and without beginning or end. The spirit sees something complete but cannot explain or name it. It experiences this perception as a participation, similar to how one fire enkindles another without diminishing the original.",
