  "original_text": "Here libido becomes fire, flame and snake. The Egyptian symbol of the\n“living disc of the sun,” the disc with the two entwining snakes,\ncontains the combination of both the libido analogies. The disc of the\nsun with its fructifying warmth is analogous to the fructifying warmth\nof love. The comparison of the libido with sun and fire is in reality\nanalogous.\n\nThere is also a “causative” element in it, for sun and fire as\nbeneficent powers are objects of human love; for example, the sun-hero\nMithra is called the “well-beloved.” In Nietzsche’s poem the comparison\nis also a causative one, but this time in a reversed sense. The\ncomparison with the snake is unequivocally phallic, corresponding\ncompletely with the tendency in antiquity, which was to see in the\nsymbol of the phallus the quintessence of life and fruitfulness. _The\nphallus is the source of life and libido, the great creator and worker\nof miracles_, and as such it received reverence everywhere. We have,\ntherefore, three designating symbols of the libido: First, the\n_comparison by analogy_, as sun and fire. Second, the _comparisons based\non causative relations_, as A: Object comparison. The libido is\ndesignated by its object, for example, the beneficent sun. B: _The\nsubject comparison_, in which the libido is designated by its place of\norigin or by analogies of this, for example, by phallus or (analogous)\nsnake.\n\nTo these two fundamental forms of comparison still a third is added, in\nwhich the “tertium comparationis” is _the activity_; for example, the\nlibido is dangerous when fecundating like the bull—through the power of\nits passion—like the lion, like the raging boar when in heat, like the\never-rutting ass, and so on.\n\nThis activity comparison can belong equally well to the category of the\nanalogous or to the category of the causative comparisons. _The\npossibilities of comparison mean just as many possibilities for symbolic\nexpression_, and from this basis all the infinitely varied symbols, so\nfar as they are libido images, may properly be reduced to a very simple\nroot, that is, just to _libido and its fixed primitive qualities_. This\npsychologic reduction and simplification is in accordance with the\nhistoric efforts of civilization to unify and simplify, to syncretize,\nthe endless number of the gods. We come across this desire as far back\nas the old Egyptians, where the unlimited polytheism as exemplified in\nthe numerous demons of places finally necessitated simplification. All\nthe various local gods, Amon of Thebes, Horus of Edfu, Horus of the\nEast, Chnum of Elephantine, Atum of Heliopolis, and others,[143] became\nidentified with the sun God Rê. In the hymns to the sun the composite\nbeing Amon-Rê-Harmachis-Atum was invoked as “the only god which truly\nlives.”[144]\n\nAmenhotep IV (XVIII dynasty) went the furthest in this direction. He\nreplaced all former gods by the “living great disc of the sun,” the\nofficial title reading:\n\n  “The sun ruling both horizons, triumphant in the horizon in his name;\n  the glittering splendor which is in the sun’s disc.”\n\n“And, indeed,” Erman adds,[145] “the sun, as a God, should not be\nhonored, but the sun itself as a planet which imparts through its\nrays[146] the infinite life which is in it to all living creatures.”\n\nAmenhotep IV by his reform completed a work which is psychologically\nimportant. He united all the bull,[147] ram,[148] crocodile[149] and\npile-dwelling[150] gods into the disc of the sun, and made it clear that\ntheir various attributes were compatible with the sun’s attributes.[151]\nA similar fate overtook the Hellenic and Roman polytheism through the\nsyncretistic efforts of later centuries. The beautiful prayer of\nLucius[152] to the queen of the Heavens furnishes an important proof of\nthis:\n\n  “Queen of Heaven, whether thou art the genial Ceres, the prime parent\n  of fruits;—or whether thou art celestial Venus;—or whether thou art\n  the sister of Phœbus;—or whether thou art Proserpina, terrific with\n  midnight howlings—with that feminine brightness of thine illuminating\n  the walls of every city.”[153]\n\nThis attempt to gather again into a few units the religious thoughts\nwhich were divided into countless variations and personified in\nindividual gods according to their polytheistic distribution and\nseparation makes clear the fact that already at an earlier time\nanalogies had formally arisen. Herodotus is rich in just such\nreferences, not to mention the systems of the Hellenic-Roman world.\nOpposed to the endeavor to form a unity there stands a still stronger\nendeavor to create again and again a multiplicity, so that even in the\nso-called severe monotheistic religions, as Christianity, for example,\nthe polytheistic tendency is irrepressible. The Deity is divided into\nthree parts at least, to which is added the feminine Deity of Mary and\nthe numerous company of the lesser gods, the angels and saints,\nrespectively. These two tendencies are in constant warfare. There is\nonly one God with countless attributes, or else there are many gods who\nare then simply known differently, according to locality, and personify\nsometimes this, sometimes that attribute of the fundamental thought, an\nexample of which we have seen above in the Egyptian gods.\n\nWith this we turn once more to Nietzsche’s poem, “The Beacon.” We found\nthe flame there used as an image of the libido, theriomorphically\nrepresented as a snake (also as an image of the soul:[154] “This flame\nis mine own soul”). We saw that the snake is to be taken as a phallic\nimage of the libido (upreared in impatience), and that this image, also\nan attribute of the conception of the sun (the Egyptian sun idol), is an\nimage of the libido in the combination of sun and phallus. It is not a\nwholly strange conception, therefore, that the sun’s disc is represented\nwith a penis, as well as with hands and feet. We find proof for this\nidea in a peculiar part of the Mithraic liturgy: ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὁ\nκαλούμενος αὐλός, ἡ ἀρχὴ τοῦ λειτουργοῦντος ἀνέμου. Ὄψει γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ\nδίσκου ὡς αὐλὸν κρεμάμενον.[155]\n\nThis extremely important vision of a tube hanging down from the sun\nwould produce in a religious text, such as that of the Mithraic liturgy,\na strange and at the same time meaningless effect if it did not have the\nphallic meaning. The tube is the place of origin of the wind. The\nphallic meaning seems very faint in this idea, but one must remember\nthat the wind, as well as the sun, is a fructifier and creator. This has\nalready been pointed out in a footnote.[156] There is a picture by a\nGermanic painter of the Middle Ages of the “conceptio immaculata” which\ndeserves mention here. The conception is represented by a tube or pipe\ncoming down from heaven and passing beneath the skirt of Mary. Into this\nflies the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove for the impregnation of the\nMother of God.[157]\n\nHonegger discovered the following hallucination in an insane man\n(paranoid dement): The patient sees in the sun an “upright tail” similar\nto an erected penis. When he moves his head back and forth, then, too,\nthe sun’s penis sways back and forth in a like manner, and out of that\nthe wind arises. This strange hallucination remained unintelligible to\nus for a long time until I became acquainted with the Mithraic liturgy\nand its visions. This hallucination threw an illuminating light, as it\nappears to me, upon a very obscure place in the text which immediately\nfollows the passage previously cited:\n\n  εἰς δὲ τὰ μέρη τὰ πρὸς λίβα ἀπέραντον οἷον ἀπηλιώτην. Ἐὰν ᾖ\n  κεκληρώμενος εἰς δὲ τὰ μέρη τοῦ ἀπηλιώτου ὁ ἕτερος, ὁμοίως εἰς τὰ μέρη\n  τὰ ἐκείνου ὄψει τὴν ἀποφορὰν τοῦ ὁρμάτος.\n\nMead translates this very clearly:[158]\n\n  “And towards the regions westward, as though it were an infinite\n  Eastwind. But if the other wind, towards the regions of the East,\n  should be in service, in the like fashion shalt thou see towards the\n  regions of that side the converse of the sight.”\n\nIn the original ὅραμα is the vision, the thing seen. ἀποφορά means\nproperly the carrying away. The sense of the text, according to this,\nmight be: the thing seen may be carried or turned sometimes here,\nsometimes there, according to the direction of the wind. The ὅραμα is\nthe tube, “the place of origin of the wind,” which turns sometimes to\nthe east, sometimes to the west, and, one might add, generates the\ncorresponding wind. The vision of the insane man coincides astonishingly\nwith this description of the movement of the tube.[159]\n\nThe various attributes of the sun, separated into a series, appear one\nafter the other in the Mithraic liturgy. According to the vision of\nHelios, seven maidens appear with the heads of snakes, and seven gods\nwith the heads of black bulls.\n\nIt is easy to understand the maiden as a symbol of the libido used in\nthe sense of causative comparison. The snake in Paradise is usually\nconsidered as feminine, as the seductive principle in woman, and is\nrepresented as feminine by the old artists, although properly the snake\nhas a phallic meaning. Through a similar change of meaning the snake in\nantiquity becomes the symbol of the earth, which on its side is always\nconsidered feminine. The bull is the well-known symbol for the\nfruitfulness of the sun. The bull gods in the Mithraic liturgy were\ncalled κνωθακοφύλακες, “guardians of the axis of the earth,” by whom the\naxle of the orb of the heavens was turned. The divine man, Mithra, also\nhad the same attributes; he is sometimes called the “Sol invictus”\nitself, sometimes the mighty companion and ruler of Helios; he holds in\nhis right hand the “bear constellation, which moves and turns the\nheavens.” The bull-headed gods, equally ἱεροὶ καὶ ἄλκιμοι νεανίαι with\nMithra himself, to whom the attribute νεώτερος, “young one,” “the\nnewcomer,” is given, are merely attributive components of the same\ndivinity. The chief god of the Mithraic liturgy is himself subdivided\ninto Mithra and Helios; the attributes of each of these are closely\nrelated to the other. Of Helios it is said: ὄψει θεὸν νεώτερον εὐειδῆ\nπυρινότριχα ἐν χιτῶνι λευκῷ καὶ χλαμύδι κοκκίνῃ, ἔχοντα πύρινον\nστέφανον.[160]",
