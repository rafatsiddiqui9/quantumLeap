- content: 'Text: """“Indeed, man does not change so quickly; his psychology at bottom  remains
    the same, and even if his culture varies much from one epoch  to another, it does
    not change the functioning of his mind. The  fundamental laws of the mind remain
    the same, at least during the  short historical period of which we have knowledge,
    and all phenomena,  even the most strange, must be capable of explanation by those
    common  laws of the mind which we can recognize in ourselves.”The psychologist
    should accept this viewpoint without reservation as peculiarly applicable to himself.
    To-day, indeed, in our civilization the phallic processions, the Dionysian mysteries
    of classical Athens, the barefaced Phallic emblems, have disappeared from our
    coins, houses, temples and streets; so also have the theriomorphic representations
    of the Deity been reduced to small remnants, like the Dove of the Holy Ghost,
    the Lamb of God and the Cock of Peter adorning our church towers. In the same
    way, the capture and violation of women have shrunken away to crimes. Yet all
    of this does not affect the fact that we, in childhood, go through a period in
    which the impulses toward these archaic inclinations appear again and again, and
    that through all our life we possess, side by side with the newly recruited, directed
    and adapted thought, a phantastic thought which corresponds to the thought of
    the centuries of antiquity and barbarism. Just as our bodies still keep the reminders
