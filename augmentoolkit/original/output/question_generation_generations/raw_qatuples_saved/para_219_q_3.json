    "paragraph": "Let us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom of boring. Let us imagine a strong adult man carrying on the boring with two pieces of wood with the same perseverance and the energy corresponding to that of this child. He may very easily create fire by this play. But of greatest significance in this work is the rhythm.[307] This hypothesis seems to me psychologically possible, although it should not be said with this that only in this way could the discovery of fire occur. It can result just as well by the striking together of flints. It is scarcely possible that fire was created in only one way. All I want to establish here is merely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications of which point to the possibility that in such a way was fire invented or prepared.",

    "question": "What does the author suggest about the discovery of fire in terms of its origins?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the discovery of fire could have occurred through various methods, not just through the rhythmic rubbing of wood. While the rhythmic motion is a plausible method, the author implies that other methods, such as striking flints, could also have contributed to the discovery of fire. The key point is that fire was likely invented or prepared through different processes, but the rhythmic action is an example of one such process.",
