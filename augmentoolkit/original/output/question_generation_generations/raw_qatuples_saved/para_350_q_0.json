    "question": "How might a person's resistance to change often be hidden?",
    "answer": "A person's resistance to change often hides under the covering of a stubborn resistance against the end or final outcome of the change. This means that even though a person may appear to be firmly opposed to a change, their true resistance might be better understood by looking at their stance towards the ultimate goal or conclusion of that change.",
