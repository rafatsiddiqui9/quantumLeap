    "question": "How does the author suggest one should approach the idea of achieving wisdom?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that pursuing wisdom is commendable and beneficial, and that it is ridiculous to wish for it when it is within your power to achieve it. There is no need for physical or symbolic acts such as lifting hands to heaven or praying to an idol to gain access to divine intervention.
