    "paragraph": "Art has preserved much of the remnants of sun-worship,[179] thus the nimbus around the head of Christ and the halo of the saints in general. The Christian legends also attribute many fire and light symbols to the saints.[180] The twelve apostles, for example, are likened to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and are represented, therefore, with a star over the head.[181]It is not to be wondered at that the heathen, as Tertullian avows, considered the sun as the Christian God. Among the Manichaeans God was really the sun. One of the most remarkable works extant, where the Pagan, Asiatic, Hellenic and Christian intermingle, is the \u1f18\u03be\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, edited by Wirth.[182] This is a book of fables, but, nevertheless, a mine for near-Christian phantasies, which gives a profound insight into Christian symbolism. In this is found the following magical dedication: \u0394\u03b9\u1f76 \u1f29\u03bb\u03af\u1ff3 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff3 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u1ff3 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u2014.[183] In certain parts of Armenia the rising sun is still worshipped by Christians, that \u201cit may let its foot rest upon the faces of the worshippers.\u201d[184] The foot occurs as an anthropomorphic attribute, and we have already met the theriomorphic attribute in the feathers and the sun phallus. Other comparisons of the sun\u2019s ray, as knife, sword, arrow, and so on, have also, as we have learned from the psychology of the dream, a phallic meaning at bottom. This meaning is attached to the foot as I here point out,[185] and also to the feathers, or hair, of the sun, which signify the power or strength of the sun. I refer to the story of Samson, and to that of the Apocalypse of Baruch, concerning the ph\u0153nix bird, which, flying before the sun, loses its feathers, and, exhausted, is strengthened again in an ocean bath at evening.",
