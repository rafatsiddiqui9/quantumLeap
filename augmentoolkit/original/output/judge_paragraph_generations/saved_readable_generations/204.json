{"paragraph": "This general classical application of the conception agrees with the corresponding etymological context of the word, _libido_ or _lubido_ (with _libet_, more ancient _lubet_), it pleases me, and _libens_ or _lubens_ = gladly, willingly. Sanskrit, _l\u00fabhyati_ = to experience violent longing, _l\u00f4bhayati_ = excites longing, _lubdha-h_ = eager, _l\u00f4bha-h_ = longing, eagerness. Gothic = _liufs_, and Old High German _liob_ = love. Moreover, in Gothic, _lubains_ was represented as hope; and Old High German, _lob\u00f4n_ = to praise, _lob_ = commendation, praise, glory; Old Bulgarian, _ljubiti_ = to love, _ljuby_ = love; Lithuanian, _li\u00e1upsinti_ = to praise.[236] It can be said that the conception of libido as developed in the new work of Freud and of his school has functionally the same significance in the biological territory as has the conception of energy since the time of Robert Mayer in the physical realm.[237] It may not be superfluous to say something more at this point concerning the conception of libido after we have followed the formation of its symbol to its highest expression in the human form of the religious hero.CHAPTER II       THE CONCEPTION AND THE GENETIC THEORY OF LIBIDO", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
