    "paragraph": "Here libido becomes fire, flame and snake. The Egyptian symbol of the \u201cliving disc of the sun,\u201d the disc with the two entwining snakes, contains the combination of both the libido analogies. The disc of the sun with its fructifying warmth is analogous to the fructifying warmth of love. The comparison of the libido with sun and fire is in reality analogous.There is also a \u201ccausative\u201d element in it, for sun and fire as beneficent powers are objects of human love; for example, the sun-hero Mithra is called the \u201cwell-beloved.\u201d In Nietzsche\u2019s poem the comparison is also a causative one, but this time in a reversed sense. The comparison with the snake is unequivocally phallic, corresponding completely with the tendency in antiquity, which was to see in the symbol of the phallus the quintessence of life and fruitfulness. _The phallus is the source of life and libido, the great creator and worker of miracles_, and as such it received reverence everywhere. We have, therefore, three designating symbols of the libido: First, the _comparison by analogy_, as sun and fire. Second, the _comparisons based on causative relations_, as A: Object comparison. The libido is designated by its object, for example, the beneficent sun. B: _The subject comparison_, in which the libido is designated by its place of origin or by analogies of this, for example, by phallus or (analogous) snake.To these two fundamental forms of comparison still a third is added, in which the \u201ctertium comparationis\u201d is _the activity_; for example, the libido is dangerous when fecundating like the bull\u2014through the power of its passion\u2014like the lion, like the raging boar when in heat, like the ever-rutting ass, and so on.",

    "question": "What are the three main symbols used to represent libido according to the text, and how do they function?",
    "answer": "The three main symbols used to represent libido are:\n\n1. **Comparison by analogy**: This involves comparing libido to the sun and fire. The sun and fire are seen as sources of warmth and life, just as libido is.\n2. **Comparisons based on causative relations**: \n   - **Object comparison**: The libido is designated by its object, such as the beneficent sun.\n   - **Subject comparison**: The libido is designated by its place of origin or by analogous symbols, such as the phallus or a snake.\n3. **Comparisons based on activity**: The libido is compared to the aggressive or fecundating activity of certain animals, such as the bull, the lion, the boar, or the ever-rutting ass, highlighting its dangerous and powerful nature.",
