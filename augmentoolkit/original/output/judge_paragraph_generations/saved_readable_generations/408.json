{"paragraph": "There is still to be considered one more source of the reanimation of the mother-imago. We have already met it in the discussion of the mother scene in \u201cFaust,\u201d that is to say, _the willed introversion of a creative mind_, which, retreating before its own problem and inwardly collecting its forces, dips at least for a moment into the source of life, in order there to wrest a little more strength from the mother for the completion of its work. It is a mother-child play with one\u2019s self, in which lies much weak selfadmiration and self-adulation (\u201cAmong a hundred mirrors\u201d\u2014Nietzsche); _a Narcissus state_, a strange spectacle, perhaps, for profane eyes. The separation from the mother-imago, the birth out of one\u2019s self, reconciles all conflicts through the sufferings. This is probably meant by Nietzsche\u2019s verse:\u201cWhy hast thou enticed thyself         Into the Paradise of the old serpent?         Why hast thou crept         Into thyself, thyself?...\u201cA sick man now         Sick of a serpent\u2019s poison,[620]         A captive now         Whom the hardest destiny befell         In thine own pit;         Bowed down as thou workest         Encaved within thyself,         Burrowing into thyself,         Helpless,         Stiff,         A corpse.         Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,         Overburdened by thyself.         A wise man,         A self-knower,         The wise Zarathustra;         Thou soughtest the heaviest burden         And foundest thou thyself....\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
