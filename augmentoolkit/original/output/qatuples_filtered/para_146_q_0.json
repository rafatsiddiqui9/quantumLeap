For we being many are one bread, and one body; for  we are all partakers of one bread.\u201d\u2014_I Corinthians_ x: 16, 17.Bread and wine are the body and the blood of Christ; the food of the immortals who are brothers with Christ, \u1f00\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03af, those who come from the same womb. We who are reborn again from the mother are all heroes together with Christ, and enjoy immortal food. As with the Jews, so too with the Christians, there is imminent danger of unworthy partaking, for this mystery, which is very closely related psychologically with the subterranean Hierosgamos of Eleusis, involves a mysterious union of man in a spiritual sense,[751] which was constantly misunderstood by the profane and was retranslated into his language, where mystery is equivalent to orgy and secrecy to vice.[752] A very interesting blasphemer and sectarian of the beginning of the nineteenth century named Untern\u00e4hrer has made the following comment on the last supper:\u201cThe communion of the devil is in this brothel. All they sacrifice  here, they sacrifice to the devil and not to God. There they have the  devil\u2019s cup and the devil\u2019s dish; _there they have sucked the head of  the snake_,[753] there they have fed upon the iniquitous bread and  drunken the wine of wickedness.\u201d[754]Untern\u00e4hrer is an adherent or a forerunner of the \u201ctheory of living one\u2019s own nature.\u201d He dreams of himself as a sort of priapic divinity; he says of himself:\u201cBlack-haired, very charming and handsome in countenance, and every  one enjoys listening to thee on account of the amiable speeches which  come from thy mouth; therefore the maids love thee.\u201dHe preaches \u201cthe cult of nakedness.\u201d",
