    "paragraph": "The active fructifying (upward striving) form of the libido is changed into the negative force striving downwards towards death. The hero as zodion of spring (ram, bull) conquers the depths of winter; and beyond the summer solstice is attacked by the unconscious longing for death, and is bitten by the snake. However, he himself is the snake. But he is at war with himself, and, therefore, the descent and the end appear to him as the malicious inventions of the mother of death, who in this way wishes to draw him to herself. The mysteries, however, consolingly promise that there is no contradiction[782] or disharmony when life is changed into death: \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd.Nietzsche, too, gives expression to this mystery:[783]\u201c_Here do I sit now_,        That is, I\u2019m swallowed down        By this the smallest oasis\u2014        \u2014It opened up just yawning,        Its loveliest maw agape.

Stone grinds on stone, the desert        Gulps and strangles.        The monstrous death gazes, glowing brown,        And chews\u2014his life is his chewing ...

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the hero's internal conflict?",
    "answer": "The hero is described as being in a state of internal war, where the descent and the end of life appear to him as the malicious inventions of the mother of death. This suggests that the hero views his own descent into death as an external threat, imposed by a force from within.",
