    "paragraph": "\u201c\u2018Better to die than to live here,\u2019\u2014thus rings the imperative voice of  seduction: and this here, this \u2018at home\u2019 is all, that it (the soul)  has loved until now! A sudden terror and suspicion against that which  it has loved, a lightning flash of scorn towards that which is called  \u2018duty,\u2019 a rebellious, arbitrary, volcanic, impelling desire for  travelling, for strange countries, estrangements, coolness, frigidity,  disillusionments, a hatred of love, perhaps a sacrilegious touch and  glance backwards[630] there where just now it adored and loved,  perhaps a blush of shame over what it has just done, and at the same  time an exultation over having done it, an intoxicating internal  joyous thrill, in which a victory reveals itself\u2014a victory? Over what?  Over whom? An enigmatic, doubtful, questioning victory, but the first  triumph. Of such woe and pain is formed the history of the great  detachment. It is like a disease which can destroy men,\u2014this first  eruption of strength and will towards self-assertion.\u201d[631]The danger lies, as is brilliantly expressed by Nietzsche, in isolation in one\u2019s self:\u201cSolitude surrounds and embraces him ever more threatening, ever more  constricting, ever more heart-strangling, the terrible Goddess and  Mater s\u00e6va cupidinum.\u201dThe libido taken away from the mother, who is abandoned only reluctantly, becomes threatening as a serpent, the symbol of death, for the relation to the mother must cease, _must die, which itself almost causes man\u2019s death_. In \u201cMater s\u00e6va cupidinum\u201d the idea attains rare, almost conscious, perfection.I do not presume to try to paint in better words than has Nietzsche the psychology of the wrench from childhood.Miss Miller furnishes us with a further reference to a material which has influenced her creation in a more general manner; this is the great Indian epic of Longfellow, \u201cThe Song of Hiawatha.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the relationship between the child's libido and the mother, and how does this relationship change?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that the child's libido, which is deeply connected to the mother, becomes threatening as the child is torn away from her. The mother is reluctantly abandoned, and her role in the child's life changes from nurturing to a source of tension and conflict. This relationship must ultimately cease and die, which can be almost as devastating as the child's own death. The term \"Mater s\u00e6va cupidinum\" metaphorically describes this agonizing separation and transformation.",
