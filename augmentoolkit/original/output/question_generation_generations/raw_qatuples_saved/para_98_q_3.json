    "paragraph": "We call this thinking, thinking with directed attention. It has, in addition, the peculiarity that one is tired by it, and that, on this account, it is set into action only for a time. Our whole vital accomplishment, which is so expensive, is adaptation to environment; a part of it is the directed thinking, which, biologically expressed, is nothing but a process of psychic assimilation, which, as in every vital accomplishment, leaves behind a corresponding exhaustion.The material with which we think is _language and speech concept_, a thing which has been used from time immemorial as something external, a bridge for thought, and which has a single purpose\u2014that of communication. As long as we think directedly, we think for others and speak to others.[17]Speech is originally a system of emotional and imitative sounds\u2014sounds which express terror, fear, anger, love; and sounds which imitate the noises of the elements, the rushing and gurgling of water, the rolling of thunder, the tumults of the winds, the tones of the animal world, and so on; and, finally, those which represent a combination of the sounds of perception and of affective reaction.[18] Likewise in the more or less modern languages, large quantities of onomatopoetic relics are retained; for example, sounds for the movement of water,\u2014Rauschen, risseln, r\u00fbschen, rinnen, rennen, to rush, ruscello,  ruisseau, river, Rhein.Wasser, wissen, wissern, pissen, piscis, fisch.Thus language is originally and essentially nothing but a system of signs or symbols, which denote real occurrences, or their echo in the human soul.Therefore one must decidedly agree with Anatole France,[19] when he says,",

    "question": "What are the origins of language as described in the text, and what are some examples of onomatopoetic sounds in different languages?",
    "answer": "Language originally and essentially consists of a system of signs or symbols that denote real occurrences or their echo in the human soul. In the origin of language, it was a system of emotional and imitative sounds, such as those expressing fear, anger, or imitating natural sounds. For example, in modern languages, onomatopoetic relics like \"Rauschen\" (German for \"rasping\" or \"rustling\"), \"wissern\" (German for \"to urinate\"), and \"piscis\" (Latin for \"fish\") represent sounds that imitate natural phenomena or reactions.",
