    "paragraph": "It is evident that the pious here fight their way to a share in the mystery of the raping of the mother.[536] This is the part which belongs to them,[537] while the heroic deed belongs to the god.[538] By Ares is meant the Egyptian Typhon, as we have good reasons to suppose. _Thus Typhon represents the evil longing for the mother_ with which other myth forms reproach the mother, according to the well-known example. The death of Balder, quite analogous to the death of Osiris (attack of sickness of R\u00ea), because of the wounding by the branch of the mistletoe, seems to need a similar explanation. It is recounted in the myth how all creatures were pledged not to hurt Balder, save only the mistletoe, which was forgotten, presumably because it was too young. This killed Balder. Mistletoe is a parasite. The female piece of wood in the fire-boring ritual was obtained[539] from the wood of a parasitical or creeping plant, the fire mother. The \u201cmare\u201d rests upon \u201cMarentak,\u201d in which Grimm suspects the mistletoe. The mistletoe was a remedy against barrenness. In Gaul the Druid alone was allowed to climb the holy oak amid solemn ceremonies after the completed sacrifice, in order to cut off the ritual mistletoe.[540] This act is a religiously limited and organized incest. That which grows on the tree is the child,[541] which man might have by the mother; then man himself would be in a renewed and rejuvenated form; and precisely this is what man cannot have, because the incest prohibition forbids it. As the Celtic custom shows, the act is performed by the priest only, with the observation of certain ceremonies; the hero god and the redeemer of the world, however, do the unpermitted, the superhuman thing, and through it purchase immortality.

    "question": "What role does the mistletoe play in the myth, and why is it significant?\n\n**ANSWERS:**\nMistletoe is a significant element in the myth. It is a parasite and is seen as a remedy against barrenness. The mistletoe being the only plant not pledged not to hurt Balder, leading to his death, highlights its importance and the potential consequences of overlooking such elements. This act of using the mistletoe to cause Balder's death is significant because it underscores the myth's theme of the unforeseen and the consequences of neglect.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the symbolic meaning behind the act of climbing the holy oak to cut the ritual mistletoe by the Druid, and how does it relate to the theme of incest?",
    "answer": "The act of climbing the holy oak to cut the ritual mistletoe by the Druid is a religiously limited and organized incest, symbolizing the act of a man having a child through the mother. This act is a form of religious and ritualized incest, which is forbidden in human life but performed by the god-redeemer, leading to immortality. The symbolic meaning behind this act is that it represents the renewal and rejuvenation that man cannot achieve due to the incest prohibition.",
