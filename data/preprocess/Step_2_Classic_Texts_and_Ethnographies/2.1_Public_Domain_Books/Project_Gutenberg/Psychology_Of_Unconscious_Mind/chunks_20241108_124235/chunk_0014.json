Take\nfirst, the analogy to the Lost Paradise. Job lost all that he had, and\nthis was due to an act of Satan, who wished to incite him against God.\nIn the same way mankind, through the temptation of the serpent, lost\nParadise, and was plunged into earth’s torments. The idea, or rather the\nmood which is expressed by the reference to the Lost Paradise, is Miss\nMiller’s feeling that she had lost something which was connected with\nsatanic temptation. To her it happened, just as to Job, that she\nsuffered innocently, for she did not fall a victim to temptation. Job’s\nsufferings are not understood by his friends;[69] no one knows that\nSatan has taken a hand in the game, and that Job is truly innocent. Job\nnever tires of avowing his innocence. Is there a hint in that? We know\nthat certain neurotic and especially mentally diseased people\ncontinually defend their innocence against non-existent attacks;\nhowever, one discovers at a closer examination that the patient, while\nhe apparently defends his innocence without reason, fulfils with that a\n“Deckhandlung,” the energy for which arises from just those impulses,\nwhose sinful character is revealed by the contents of the pretended\nreproach and calumny.[70]\n\nJob suffered doubly, on one side through the loss of his fortune, on the\nother through the lack of understanding in his friends; the latter can\nbe seen throughout the book. The suffering of the misunderstood recalls\nthe figure of Cyrano de Bergerac—he too suffered doubly, on one side\nthrough hopeless love, on the other side through misunderstanding. He\nfalls, as we have seen, in the last hopeless battle against “Le\nMensonge, les Compromis, les Préjugés, les Lâchetés et la Sottise.—Oui,\nVous m’arrachez tout le laurier et la rose!”\n\nJob laments\n\n      “God delivereth me to the ungodly,\n      And casteth me into the hands of the wicked,\n      I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;\n      Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:\n\n      “_He hath also set me up for his mark.\n      His archers compass me round about_;\n      He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;\n      He poureth out my gall upon the ground.\n      He breaketh me with breach upon breach;\n      He runneth upon me like a giant.”—_Job_ xvi: 11–15.\n\nThe analogy of feeling lies in the suffering of the hopeless struggle\nagainst the more powerful. It is as if this conflict were accompanied\nfrom afar by the sounds of “creation,” which brings up a beautiful and\nmysterious image belonging to the unconscious, and which has not yet\nforced its way up to the light of the upper world. We surmise, rather\nthan know, that this battle has really something to do with creation,\nwith the struggles between negations and affirmations. The references to\nRostand’s “Cyrano” through the identification with Christian, to\nMilton’s “Paradise Lost,” to the sorrows of Job, misunderstood by his\nfriends, betray plainly that in the soul of the poet something was\nidentified with these ideas. She also has suffered like Cyrano and Job,\nhas lost paradise, and dreams of “creation,”—creation by means of\nthought—fruition through the whirlwind of Anaxagoras.[71]\n\nWe once more submit ourselves to Miss Miller’s guidance:\n\n  “I remember that when fifteen years old, I was once very much stirred\n  up over an article, read aloud to me by my mother, concerning the idea\n  which spontaneously produced its object. I was so excited that I could\n  not sleep all night because of thinking over and over again what that\n  could mean.\n\n  “From the age of nine to sixteen, I went every Sunday to a\n  Presbyterian Church, in charge of which, at that time, was a very\n  cultured minister. In one of the earliest memories which I have\n  retained of him, I see myself as a very small girl sitting in a very\n  large pew, continually endeavoring to keep myself awake and pay\n  attention, without in the least being able to understand what he meant\n  when he spoke to us of Chaos, Cosmos and the Gift of Love (don\n  d’amour).”\n\nThere are also rather early memories of the awakening of puberty (nine\nto sixteen) which have connected the idea of the cosmos springing from\nchaos with the “don d’amour.” The medium in which these associations\noccur is the memory of a certain very much honored ecclesiastic who\nspoke those dark words. From the same period of time comes the\nremembrance of that excitement about the idea of the “creative thought”\nwhich from itself “produced its object.” Here are two ways of creation\nintimated: the creative thought, and the mysterious reference to the\n“don d’amour.”\n\nAt the time when I had not yet understood the nature of psychoanalysis,\nI had a fortunate opportunity of winning through continual observation a\ndeep insight into the soul of a fifteen-year-old girl. Then I\ndiscovered, with astonishment, what the contents of the unconscious\nphantasies are, and how far removed they are from those which a girl of\nthat age shows outwardly. There are wide-reaching phantasies of truly\nmythical fruitfulness. The girl was, in the split-off phantasy, the\nrace-mother of uncounted peoples.[72] If we deduct the poetically spoken\nphantasy of the girl, elements are left which at that age are common to\nall girls, for the unconscious content is to an infinitely greater\ndegree common to all mankind than the content of the individual\nconsciousness. For it is the condensation of that which is historically\nthe average and ordinary.\n\nMiss Miller’s problem at this age was the common human problem: “How am\nI to be creative?” Nature knows but one answer to that: “Through the\nchild (don d’amour!).” “But how is the child attained?” Here the\nterrifying problem emerges, which, as our analytic experience shows, is\nconnected with the father,[73] where it cannot be solved; because the\noriginal sin of incest weighs heavily for all time upon the human race.\nThe strong and natural love which binds the child to the father, turns\naway in those years during which the humanity of the father would be all\ntoo plainly recognized, to the higher forms of the father, to the\n“Fathers” of the church, and to the Father God,[74] visibly represented\nby them, and in that there lies still less possibility of solving the\nproblem. However, mythology is not lacking in consolations. Has not the\n_logos_ become flesh too? Has not the divine _pneuma_, even the _logos_,\nentered the Virgin’s womb and lived among us as the son of man? That\nwhirlwind of Anaxagoras was precisely the divine νοῦς which from out of\nitself has become the world. Why do we cherish the image of the Virgin\nMother even to this day? Because it is always comforting and says\nwithout speech or noisy sermon to the one seeking comfort, “I too have\nbecome a mother,”—through the “idea which spontaneously produces its\nobject.”\n\nI believe that there is foundation enough at hand for a sleepless night,\nif those phantasies peculiar to the age of puberty were to become\npossessed of this idea—the results would be immeasurable! All that is\npsychologic has an under and an over meaning, as is expressed in the\nprofound remark of the old mystic: οὐρανὸς ἄνο, οὐρανὸς κάτο, αἰθέρα\nἄνο, αἰθέρα κάτο, πᾶν τοῦτο ἄνο, πᾶν τοῦτο κάτο, τοῦτο λαβὲ καὶ\nεὐτυχει[75]—\n\nWe would show but slight justice, however, to the intellectual\noriginality of our author, if we were satisfied to trace back the\ncommotion of that sleepless night absolutely and entirely to the sexual\nproblem in a narrow sense. That would be but one-half, and truly, to\nmake use of the mystic’s expression, only the under half. The other half\nis the intellectual sublimation, which strives to make true in its own\nway the ambiguous expression of “the idea which produces its object\nspontaneously,”—_ideal creation in place of the real_.\n\nIn such an intellectual accomplishment of an evidently very capable\npersonality, the prospect of a spiritual fruitfulness is something which\nis worthy of the highest aspiration, since for many it will become a\nnecessity of life. Also this side of the phantasy explains, to a great\nextent, the excitement, for it is a thought with a presentiment of the\nfuture; one of those thoughts which arise, to use one of Maeterlinck’s\nexpressions,[76] from the “inconscient supérieur,” that “prospective\npotency” of subliminal combinations.[77]\n\nI have had the opportunity of observing certain cases of neuroses of\nyears’ duration, in which, at the time of the beginning of the illness\nor shortly before, a dream occurred, often of visionary clarity. This\nimpressed itself inextinguishably upon the memory, and in analysis\nrevealed a hidden meaning to the patient which anticipated the\nsubsequent events of life; that is to say, their psychologic\nmeaning.[78] I am inclined to grant this meaning to the commotion of\nthat restless night, because the resulting events of life, in so far as\nMiss Miller consciously and unconsciously unveils them to us, are\nentirely of a nature to confirm the supposition that that moment is to\nbe considered as the inception and presentiment of a sublimated aim in\nlife.\n\nMiss Miller concludes the list of her fancies with the following\nremarks:\n\n  “The dream seemed to me to come from a mixture of the representation\n  of ‘Paradise Lost,’ ‘Job,’ and ‘Creation,’ with ideas such as ‘thought\n  which spontaneously produces its object’: ‘the gift of love,’ ‘chaos,\n  and cosmos.’”\n\nIn the same way as colored splinters of glass are combined in a\nkaleidoscope, in her mind fragments of philosophy, æsthetics and\nreligion would seem to be combined—\n\n  “under the stimulating influence of the journey, and the countries\n  hurriedly seen, combined with the great silence and the indescribable\n  charm of the sea. ‘Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus.’ ‘Only this,\n  and nothing more!’”\n\nWith these words, Miss Miller shows us out, politely and energetically.\nHer parting words in her negation, confirmed over again in English,\nleave behind a curiosity; viz., what position is to be negated by these\nwords? “Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus”—that is to say, really, only\n“le charme impalpable de la mer”—and the young man who sang melodiously\nduring the night watch is long since forgotten, and no one is to know,\nleast of all the dreamer, that he was a morning star, who came before\nthe creation of a new day.[79] One should take care lest he satisfy\nhimself and the reader with a sentence such as “ce ne fut que cela.”\nOtherwise, it might immediately happen that one would become disturbed\nagain. This occurs to Miss Miller too, since she allowed an English\nquotation to follow,—“Only this, and nothing more,” without giving the\nsource, it is true. The quotation comes from an unusually effective\npoem, “The Raven” by Poe. The line referred to occurs in the following:\n\n     “While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping\n     As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—\n     ‘’Tis some visitor.’ I muttered, ‘tapping at my chamber door’—\n                         Only this, and nothing more.”\n\nThe spectral raven knocks nightly at his door and reminds the poet of\nhis irrevocably lost “Lenore.” The raven’s name is “Nevermore,” and as a\nrefrain to every verse he croaks his horrible “Nevermore.” Old memories\ncome back tormentingly, and the spectre repeats inexorably “Nevermore.”\nThe poet seeks in vain to frighten away the dismal guest; he calls to\nthe raven:\n\n “‘Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend,’ I shrieked,\n    upstarting—\n ‘Get thee back into the tempest and the night’s Plutonian shore!\n Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n Leave my loneliness unbroken, quit the bust above my door!\n Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!’\n                     Quoth the raven, ‘Nevermore.’”",
  "llm_raw_response": "Here are the coherent sections of the text, broken down by topic:\n\n**Section 1: The Analogy to Job and the Lost Paradise**\n\nThe text begins by discussing the analogy between Job's story and the concept of the Lost Paradise. The author suggests that Miss Miller's feelings of loss and suffering are similar to Job's, and that she may be experiencing a form of \"satanic temptation\" that is connected to her own personal struggles.\n\n**Section 2: The Suffering of the Misunderstood**\n\nThe author explores the idea that the suffering of the misunderstood is a common theme in literature and psychology. The example of Job's friends, who fail to understand his innocence, is compared to the figure of Cyrano de Bergerac, who suffers doubly due to his own misunderstandings.\n\n**Section 3: The Analogy to Creation**\n\nThe author discusses the analogy between the creation story and the idea of creation through thought. The example of the \"whirlwind of Anaxagoras\" is used to illustrate the idea that creation can occur through the power of the mind.\n\n**Section 4: Miss Miller's Memories and Associations**\n\nThe author shares Miss Miller's memories and associations from her childhood, including her experiences with the concept of the \"cosmos springing from chaos\" and her fascination with the idea of \"creative thought.\" These memories are used to illustrate the author's theory about the origins of Miss Miller's ideas.\n\n**Section 5: The Intellectual Sublimation**\n\nThe author discusses the idea of intellectual sublimation, which involves the transformation of a personal problem into a more abstract and intellectual concept. The author suggests that Miss Miller's ideas are an example of this process.\n\n**Section 6: The Dream and Its Meaning**\n\nThe author shares Miss Miller's dream, which is a mixture of references to \"Paradise Lost,\" \"Job,\" and \"Creation.\" The author suggests that the dream is a manifestation of Miss Miller's unconscious mind and that it contains hidden meanings and associations.\n\n**Section 7: The Kaleidoscope of Ideas**\n\nThe author discusses the idea that Miss Miller's mind is a kaleidoscope of ideas, combining fragments of philosophy, aesthetics, and religion. The author suggests that this process is a form of intellectual sublimation.\n\n**Section 8: The Parting Words**\n\nThe author shares Miss Miller's parting words, which include the phrase \"ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus.\" The author suggests that this phrase is a metaphor for the idea that the only true reality is the present moment, and that the past and future are merely illusions.\n\n**Section 9: The Influence of Poe**\n\nThe author notes that Miss Miller's use of the phrase \"ce ne fut que cela\" is reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven.\" The author suggests that this influence is a sign of Miss Miller's intellectual sublimation and her ability to tap into the collective unconscious.\n\n**Section 10: Conclusion**\n\nThe author concludes by summarizing the main points of the text and suggesting that Miss Miller's ideas are a manifestation of her own unconscious mind. The author also notes that the text is a prime example of intellectual sublimation and the power of the human mind to transform personal problems into abstract and intellectual concepts.",
