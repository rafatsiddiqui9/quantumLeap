    "paragraph": "This quotation shows the meaning of heavenly bliss. H\u00f6lderlin never was able to forget this first and greatest happiness, the dreamy picture of which estranged him from real life. Moreover, in this poem, the ancient _motive of the twins_ in the mother\u2019s womb is intimated. (Isis and Osiris in the mother\u2019s womb.) The motive is archaic. There is a legend in Frobenius of how the great serpent (appearing from the little serpent in the hollow tree, through the so-called stretching out of the serpent) has finally devoured all men (devouring mother\u2014death), and only a pregnant woman remains alive; she digs a ditch, covers it with a stone (grave\u2014mother\u2019s womb), and, living there, she gives birth to twins, the subsequent dragon-killers (the hero in double form, man and phallus, man and woman, man with his libido, the dying and rising sun).This existence together in the mother is to be found also very beautifully expressed in an African myth (Frobenius):\u201cIn the beginning, Obatala, the heaven, and Odudua, the earth, his  wife, lay pressed firmly together in a calabas.\u201dThe guarding \u201cin a modest bud\u201d is an idea which has appeared already in Plutarch, where it is said that the sun was born in the morning from a flower bud. Brahma, too, comes from the bud, which also gave birth in Assam to the first human pair._Humanity._(An unfinished poem.)\u201cScarcely sprouted from the waters, O Earth,  Are thy old mountain tops and diffuse odors,  While the first green islands, full of young woods, breathe delight  Through the May air over the Ocean.\u201cAnd joyfully the eye of the Sun-god looked down  Upon the firstlings of the trees and flowers;  Laughing children of his youth, born from thee;  When on the fairest of the islands....",

    "question": "How does the text connect the idea of twins in the mother's womb to ancient mythology?\n\n**ANSIS**\nThe text connects the idea of twins in the mother's womb to ancient mythology by drawing parallels to the Egyptian deities Isis and Osiris, and to the African myth involving Obatala and Odudua. It also mentions a similar concept in Plutarch, where the sun is born from a flower bud, and in the Assam legend where Brahma emerges from a bud.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the significance of the motif of the serpent devouring all men mentioned in the text?",
    "answer": "The motif of the serpent devouring all men symbolizes the idea of death and the end of existence. In the text, it is described as the serpent emerging from a hollow tree, devouring all men, and only a pregnant woman remaining alive. This motif is further connected to the legend of the pregnant woman digging a ditch, covering it with a stone (representing a grave or the mother's womb), and giving birth to twins\u2014the dragon-killers who represent rebirth and the overcoming of death.",
