In the Gnostic\nphantasies we come across a legend of the origin of man which possibly\nbelongs here: the female archons bound to the vault of Heaven are\nunable, on account of its quick rotation, to keep their young within\nthem, but let them fall upon the earth, from which men arise. Possibly\nthere is here a connection with barbaric midwifery, the letting fall of\nthe parturient. The assault upon the mother is already introduced with\nthe adventure of Mudjekeewis, and is continued in the violent handling\nof the “grandmother,” Nokomis, who, as a result of the cutting of the\nliana and the fall downwards, seems in some way to have become pregnant.\nThe “cutting of the branch,” the plucking, we have already recognized as\nmother incest. (See above.) That well-known verse, “Saxonland, where\nbeautiful maidens grow upon trees,” and phrases like “picking cherries\nin a neighbor’s garden,” allude to a similar idea. The fall downwards of\nNokomis deserves to be compared to a poetical figure in Heine.\n\n                    “A star, a star is falling\n                      Out of the glittering sky!\n                    The star of Love! I watch it\n                      Sink in the depths and die.\n\n                    “The leaves and buds are falling\n                      From many an apple-tree;\n                    I watch the mirthful breezes\n                      Embrace them wantonly...”\n\nWenonah later was courted by the caressing West Wind, and becomes\npregnant. Wenonah, as a young moon-goddess, has the beauty of the\nmoonlight. Nokomis warns her of the dangerous courtship of Mudjekeewis,\nthe West Wind. But Wenonah allows herself to become infatuated, and\nconceives from the breath of the wind, from the πνεῦμα, a son, our hero.\n\n                 “And the West-Wind came at evening,\n\n                        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n                 Found the beautiful Wenonah,\n                 Lying there amid the lilies,\n                 Wooed her with his words of sweetness,\n                 Wooed her with his soft caresses,\n                 Till she bore a son in sorrow,\n                 Bore a son of love and sorrow.”\n\nFertilization through the breath of the spirit is already a well-known\nprecedent for us. The star or comet plainly belongs to the birth scene\nas a libido symbol; Nokomis, too, comes to earth as a shooting star.\nMörike’s sweet poetic phantasy has devised a similar divine origin.\n\n               “And she who bore me in her womb,\n                 And gave me food and clothing.\n               She was a maid—a wild, brown maid,\n                 Who looked on men with loathing.\n\n               “She fleered at them and laughed out loud,\n                 And bade no suitor tarry;\n               ‘I’d rather be the Wind’s own bride\n                 Than have a man and marry.’\n\n               “Then came the Wind and held her fast\n                 His captive, love-enchanted;\n               And lo, by him a merry child\n                 Within her womb was planted.”\n\nBuddha’s marvellous birth story, retold by Sir Edwin Arnold, also shows\ntraces of this.[637]\n\n       “Maya, the Queen ...\n       Dreamed a strange dream, dreamed that a star from heaven—\n       Splendid, six-rayed, in color rosy-pearl,\n       Whereof the token was an Elephant\n       Six-tusked and white as milk of Kamadhuk—\n       Shot through the void; and shining into her,\n       Entered her womb upon the right.”[638]\n\nDuring Maya’s conception a wind blows over the land:\n\n                                      “A wind blew\n              With unknown freshness over lands and seas.”\n\nAfter the birth the four genii of the East, West, South and North come\nto render service as bearers of the palanquin. (The coming of the wise\nmen at Christ’s birth.) We also find here a distinct reference to the\n“four winds.” For the completion of the symbolism there is to be found\nin the Buddha myth, as well as in the birth legend of Christ, besides\nthe impregnation by star and wind, also the fertilization by an animal,\nhere an elephant, which with its phallic trunk fulfilled in Maya the\nChristian method of fructification through the ear or the head. It is\nwell known that, in addition to the dove, the unicorn is also a\nprocreative symbol of the Logos.\n\nHere arises the question why the birth of a hero always had to take\nplace under such strange symbolic circumstances? It might also be\nimagined that a hero arose from ordinary surroundings and gradually grew\nout of his inferior environment, perhaps with a thousand troubles and\ndangers. (And, indeed, this motive is by no means strange in the hero\nmyth.) It might be said that superstition demands strange conditions of\nbirth and generation; but why does it demand them?\n\nThe answer to this question is: that the birth of the hero, as a rule,\nis not that of an ordinary mortal, but is a rebirth from the\nmother-spouse; hence it occurs under mysterious ceremonies. Therefore,\nin the very beginning, lies the motive of the two mothers of the hero.\nAs Rank[639] has shown us through many examples, the hero is often\nobliged to experience exposure, and upbringing by foster parents, and in\nthis manner he acquires the two mothers. A striking example is the\nrelation of Hercules to Hera. In the Hiawatha epic Wenonah dies after\nthe birth and Nokomis takes her place. Maya dies after the birth[640]\nand Buddha is given a stepmother. The stepmother is sometimes an animal\n(the she-wolf of Romulus and Remus, etc.). The twofold mother may be\nreplaced by the motive of twofold birth, which has attained a lofty\nsignificance in the Christian mythology; namely, through baptism, which,\nas we have seen, represents rebirth. Thus man is born not merely in a\ncommonplace manner, but also born again in a mysterious manner, by means\nof which he becomes a participator of the kingdom of God, of\nimmortality. Any one may become a hero in this way who is generated anew\nthrough his own mother, because only through her does he share in\nimmortality. Therefore, it happened that the death of Christ on the\ncross, which creates universal salvation, was understood as “baptism”;\nthat is to say, as rebirth through the second mother, the mysterious\ntree of death. Christ says:\n\n  “But I have a baptism to be baptized with: and how am I straitened\n  till it be accomplished!”—_Luke_ xii: 50.\n\nHe interprets his death agony symbolically as birth agony.\n\nThe motive of the two mothers suggests the thought of self-rejuvenation,\nand evidently expresses the fulfilment of the wish that it _might be\npossible for the mother to bear me again_; at the same time, applied to\nthe heroes, it means one is a hero who is borne again by her who has\npreviously been his mother; that is to say, _a hero is he who may again\nproduce himself through his mother_.\n\nThe countless suggestions in the history of the procreation of the\nheroes indicate the latter formulations. Hiawatha’s father first\noverpowered the mother under the symbol of the bear; then himself\nbecoming a god, he procreates the hero. What Hiawatha had to do as hero,\nNokomis hinted to him in the legend of the origin of the moon; he is\nforcibly to throw his mother upwards (or throw downwards?); then she\nwould become pregnant by this act of violence and could bring forth a\ndaughter. This rejuvenated mother would be allotted, according to the\nEgyptian rite, as a daughter-wife to the sun-god, the father of his\nmother, for self-reproduction. What action Hiawatha takes in this regard\nwe shall see presently. We have already studied the behavior of the\npre-Asiatic gods related to Christ. Concerning the pre-existence of\nChrist, the Gospel of St. John is full of this thought. Thus the speech\nof John the Baptist:\n\n  “This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred\n  before me; for he was before me.”—_John_ i: 30.\n\nAlso the beginning of the gospel is full of deep mythologic\nsignificance:\n\n  “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the\n  Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.\n\n  (3) “All things were made by him, and without him was not anything\n  made that was made.\n\n  (4) “In him was life, and the _life_ was the _light of men_.\n\n  (5) “And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth\n  it not.\n\n  (6) “There was a man sent from God whose name was John.\n\n  (7) “The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light.\n\n  (8) “He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that\n  Light.\n\n  (9) “That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh\n  into the world.”\n\nThis is the proclamation of the reappearing light, the reborn sun, which\nformerly was, and which will be again. In the baptistry at Pisa, Christ\nis represented bringing the tree of life to man; his head is surrounded\nby a sun halo. Over this relief stand the words INTROITUS SOLIS.\n\nBecause the one born was his own procreator, the history of his\nprocreation is strangely concealed under symbolic events, which are\nmeant to conceal and deny it; hence the extraordinary assertion of the\nvirgin conception. This is meant to hide the incestuous impregnation.\nBut do not let us forget that this naïve assertion plays an unusually\nimportant part in the ingenious symbolic bridge, which is to guide the\nlibido out from the incestuous bond to higher and more useful\napplications, which indicate a new kind of immortality; that is to say,\nimmortal work.\n\nThe environment of Hiawatha’s youth is of importance:\n\n                 “By the shores of Gitche Gumee,\n                 By the shining Big-Sea-Water,\n                 Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,\n                 Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.\n                 Dark behind it rose the forest,\n                 Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,\n                 Rose the firs with cones upon them.\n                 Bright before it beat the water,\n                 Beat the clear and sunny water,\n                 Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.”\n\nIn this environment Nokomis brought him up. Here she taught him the\nfirst words, and told him the first fairy tales, and the sounds of the\nwater and the wood were intermingled, so that the child learned not only\nto understand man’s speech, but also that of Nature:\n\n                “At the door on summer evenings\n                Sat the little Hiawatha;\n                Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,\n                Heard the lapping of the water,\n                Sounds of music, words of wonder:\n                ‘Minne-wawa!’[641] said the pine-trees,\n                ‘Mudway-aushka!’[642] said the water.”\n\nHiawatha hears human speech in the sounds of Nature; thus he understands\nNature’s speech. The wind says, “Wawa.” The cry of the wild goose is\n“Wawa.” Wah-wah-taysee means the small glowworm which enchants him. Thus\nthe poet paints most beautifully the gradual gathering of external\nnature into the compass of the subjective,[643] and the intimate\nconnection of the primary object to which the first lisping words were\napplied, and from which the first sounds were derived, with the\nsecondary object, the wider nature which usurps imperceptibly the\nmother’s place, and takes possession of those sounds heard first from\nthe mother, and also of those feelings which we all discover later in\nourselves in all the warm love of Mother Nature. The later blending,\nwhether pantheistic-philosophic or æsthetic, of the sentimental,\ncultured man with nature is, looked at retrospectively, a reblending\nwith the mother, who was our primary object, and with whom we truly were\nonce wholly one.[644] Therefore, it is not astonishing when we again see\nemerging in the poetical speech of a modern philosopher, Karl Joël, the\nold pictures which symbolize the unity with the mother, illustrated by\nthe confluence of subject and object. In his recent book, “Seele und\nWelt” (1912), Joël writes as follows, in the chapter called “Primal\nExperience”[645]:",
