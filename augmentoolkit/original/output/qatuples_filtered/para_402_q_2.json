A similar death overtakes the Syrian Melcarth, who, riding upon a sea horse, was annually burned. Among the Greeks he is called Melicertes, and was represented riding upon a dolphin. The dolphin is also the steed of Arion. We have learned to recognize previously the maternal significance of dolphin, so that in the death of Melcarth we can once more recognize the negatively expressed Hierosgamos with the mother. (Compare Frazer \u201cGolden Bough,\u201d IV, p. 87.) This figurative expression is of the greatest teleological significance. Through its symbol it leads that libido which inclines backward into the original, primitive and impulsive upwards to the spiritual by investing it with a mysterious but fruitful function. It is superfluous to speak of the effect of this symbol upon the unconscious of Occidental humanity. A glance over history shows what creative forces were released in this symbol.[846]The comparison of the Mithraic and the Christian sacrifice plainly shows wherein lies the superiority of the Christian symbol; it is the frank admission that not only are the lower wishes to be sacrificed, but the whole personality. The Christian symbol demands complete devotion; it compels a veritable self-sacrifice to a higher purpose, while the Sacrificium Mithriacum, remaining fixed on a primitive symbolic stage, is contented with an animal sacrifice. The religious effect of these symbols must be considered as an orientation of the unconscious by means of imitation.",

    "question": "What is the superiority of the Christian symbol in comparison to the Mithraic sacrifice, according to the passage?",
    "answer": "The Christian symbol is superior to the Mithraic sacrifice because it fully encompasses the sacrifice of the entire personality, not just lower wishes. The Christian symbol demands complete devotion and self-sacrifice for a higher purpose, whereas the Mithraic sacrifice remains at a more primitive stage, focusing on animal sacrifices. This difference highlights the Christian symbol's broader and more comprehensive approach to spiritual and personal transformation.",
