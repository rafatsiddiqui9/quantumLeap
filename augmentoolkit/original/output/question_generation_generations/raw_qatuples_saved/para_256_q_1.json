    "paragraph": "\u201c... Above and around are reared       The summits of Time,       And the loved ones, though near,       Live on deeply separated mountains.       So give us waters of innocence,       And give us wings of true understanding,       With which to pass across and to return again.\u201dThe first is a gloomy picture of the mountains and of time\u2014although caused by the sun wandering over the mountains, the following picture a nearness, and at the same time separation, of the lovers, and seems to hint at life in the underworld,[796] where he is united with all that once was dear to him, and yet cannot enjoy the happiness of reunion, because it is all shadows and unreal and devoid of life. Here the one who descends drinks the waters of innocence, the waters of childhood, the drink of rejuvenation,[797] so wings may grow, and, winged, he may soar up again into life, like the winged sun, which arises like a swan from the water (\u201cWings, to pass across and to return again\u201d):\u201c... So I spoke, and lo, a genie        Carried me off, swifter than I had imagined,        And farther than ever I had thought        From my own house!        It grew dark        As I went in the twilight.        The shadowy wood,        And the yearning brooks of my home-land        Grew vague behind me\u2014        And I knew the country no longer.\u201dAfter the dark and obscure words of the introduction, wherein the poet expresses the prophecy of what is to come, the sun journey begins (\u201cnight journey in the sea\u201d) towards the east, towards the ascent, towards the mystery of eternity and rebirth, of which Nietzsche also dreams, and which he expressed in significant words:",

    "question": "How does the passage describe the relationship between the lovers and the setting of the underworld?",
    "answer": "The passage describes a nearness and separation between the lovers, hinting at life in the underworld where the one who descends is united with all that was once dear but cannot enjoy the happiness of reunion because it is all shadows and unreal. This suggests a place where memories and emotions persist but without the physical reality and joy of being together.",
