    "paragraph": "The vision of the \u201cthrong\u201d develops further; horses emerge; a battle is fought. With Silberer, I might accept the significance of this vision as belonging, first of all, in the \u201cfunctional category,\u201d because, fundamentally, the conception of the intermingling crowds is nothing but the symbol of the present onrush of the mass of thought; likewise the battle, and possibly the horses, which illustrate the movement. The deeper significance of the appearance of the horses will be seen for the first time in the further course of our treatment of the mother symbolism. The following vision has a more definite and significantly important character. Miss Miller sees a City of Dreams (\u201cCit\u00e9 de R\u00eaves\u201d). The picture is similar to one she saw a short time before on the cover of a magazine. Unfortunately, we learn nothing further about it. One can easily imagine under this \u201cCit\u00e9 de R\u00eaves\u201d a fulfilled wish dream, that is to say, something very beautiful and greatly longed for; a sort of heavenly Jerusalem, as the poet of the Apocalypse has dreamed it. The city is a maternal symbol, a woman who fosters the inhabitants as children. It is, therefore, intelligible that the two mother goddesses, Rhea and Cybele, both wear the wall crown. The Old Testament treats the cities of Jerusalem, Babel, etc., as women (_Isaiah_ xlvii:1\u20135):\u201cCome down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on  the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou  shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take the millstones and  grind meal; uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh,  pass over the rivers. That thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy  shame shall be seen; sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O  daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called the lady  of the kingdoms.\u201dJeremiah says of Babel (I:12):",
