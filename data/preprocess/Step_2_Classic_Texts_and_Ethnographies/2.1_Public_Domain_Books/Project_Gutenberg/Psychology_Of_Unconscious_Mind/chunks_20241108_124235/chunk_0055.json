I know not. Distance and nearness become blurred\n  into one; without and within glide into each other. Nearer and nearer,\n  _dearer and more homelike sounds the beating of the waves_; now, like\n  a thundering pulse in my head it strikes, and now it beats over my\n  soul, devours it, embraces it, while it itself at the same time floats\n  out like the blue waste of waters. Yes, without and within are one.\n  Glistening and foaming, flowing and fanning and roaring, the entire\n  symphony of the stimuli experienced sounds in one tone, all thought\n  becomes one thought, which becomes one with feeling; the world exhales\n  in the soul and the soul dissolves in the world. Our small life is\n  encircled by a great sleep—_the sleep of our cradle, the sleep of our\n  grave, the sleep of our home, from which we go forth in the morning,\n  to which we again return in the evening_; our life but the short\n  journey, the interval between the emergence from the original oneness\n  and the sinking back into it! Blue shimmers the infinite sea, wherein\n  dreams the jelly fish of the primitive life, toward which without\n  ceasing our thoughts hark back dimly through eons of existence. For\n  every happening entails a change and a guarantee of the unity of life.\n  At that moment when they are no longer blended together, in that\n  instant man lifts his _head, blind and dripping, from the depths_ of\n  the stream of experience, from the oneness with the experience; at\n  that moment of parting when the unity of life in startled surprise\n  detaches the Change and holds it away from itself as something alien,\n  at this moment of alienation the aspects of the experience have been\n  substantialized into subject and object, and in that moment\n  consciousness is born.”\n\nJoël paints here, in unmistakable symbolism, the confluence of subject\nand object as the reunion of mother and child. The symbols agree with\nthose of mythology, even in their details. The encircling and devouring\nmotive is distinctly suggested. The sea, devouring the sun and giving\nbirth to it anew, is already an old acquaintance. The moment of the rise\nof consciousness, the separation of subject and object is a birth; truly\nphilosophical thought hangs with lame wings upon the few great primitive\npictures of human speech, above the simple, all-surpassing greatness of\nwhich no thought can rise. The idea of the jelly fish is not\n“accidental.” Once when I was explaining to a patient the maternal\nsignificance of water at this contact with the mother complex, she\nexperienced a very unpleasant feeling. “It makes me squirm,” she said,\n“as if I touched a jelly fish.” Here, too, the same idea! The blessed\nstate of sleep before birth and after death is, as Joël observed,\nsomething like old shadowy memories of that unsuspecting, thoughtless\nstate of early childhood, where as yet no opposition disturbed the\npeaceful flow of dawning life, to which the inner longing always draws\nus back again and again, and from which the active life must free itself\nanew with struggle and death, so that it may not be doomed to\ndestruction. Long before Joël, an Indian chieftain had said the same\nthing in similar words to one of the restless wise men:\n\n  “Ah, my brother, you will never learn to know the happiness of\n  thinking nothing and doing nothing: this is next to sleep; this is the\n  most delightful thing there is. Thus we were before birth, thus we\n  shall be after death.”[646]\n\nWe shall see in Hiawatha’s later fate how important his early\nimpressions are in his choice of a wife. Hiawatha’s first deed was to\nkill a roebuck with his arrow:\n\n                   “Dead he lay there in the forest,\n                   By the ford across the river.”\n\nThis is typical of Hiawatha’s deeds. Whatever he kills, for the most\npart, lies _next to or in the water_, sometimes half in the water and\nhalf on the land.[647] It seems that this must well be so. The later\nadventures will teach us why this must be so. The buck was no ordinary\nanimal, but a magic one; that is to say, one with an additional\nunconscious significance. Hiawatha made for himself gloves and moccasins\nfrom its hide; the gloves imparted such strength to his arms that he\ncould crumble rocks to dust, and the moccasins had the virtue of the\nseven-league boots. By enwrapping himself in the buck’s skin he really\nbecame a giant. This motive, together with the death of the animal at\nthe ford,[648] in the water, reveals the fact that the parents are\nconcerned, whose gigantic proportions as compared with the child are of\ngreat significance in the unconscious. The “toys of giants” is a wish\ninversion of the infantile phantasy. The dream of an eleven-year-old\ngirl expresses this:\n\n  “I am as high as a church steeple; then a policeman comes. I tell him,\n  ‘If you say anything, I will cut off your head.’”\n\nThe “policeman,” as the analysis brought out, referred to the father,\nwhose gigantic size was over-compensated by the church steeple. In\nMexican human sacrifices, the gods were represented by criminals, who\nwere slaughtered, and flayed, and the Corybantes then clothed themselves\nin the bloody skins, in order to illustrate the resurrection of the\ngods.[649] (The snake’s casting of his skin as a symbol of\nrejuvenation.)\n\nHiawatha has, therefore, conquered his parents, primarily the mother,\nalthough in the form of a male animal (compare the bear of Mudjekeewis);\nand from that comes his giant’s strength. He has taken on the parent’s\nskin and now has himself become a great man. Now he started forth to his\nfirst great battle to fight with the father Mudjekeewis, in order to\navenge his dead mother Wenonah. Naturally, under this figure of speech\nhides the thought that he slays the father, in order to take possession\nof the mother. Compare the battle of Gilgamesh with the giant Chumbaba\nand the ensuing conquest of Ishtar. The father, in the psychologic\nsense, merely represents the personification of the incest prohibition;\nthat is to say, resistance, which defends the mother. Instead of the\nfather, it may be a fearful animal (the great bear, the snake, the\ndragon, etc.) which must be fought and overcome. The hero is a hero\nbecause he sees in every difficulty of life resistance to the forbidden\ntreasure, and fights that resistance with the complete yearning which\nstrives towards the treasure, attainable with difficulty, or\nunattainable, the yearning which paralyzes and kills the ordinary man.\n\nHiawatha’s father is Mudjekeewis, the west wind; the battle, therefore,\ntakes place in the west. Thence came life (impregnation of Wenonah);\nthence also came death (death of Wenonah). Hiawatha, therefore, fights\nthe typical battle of the hero for rebirth in the western sea, the\nbattle with the devouring terrible mother, this time in the form of the\nfather. Mudjekeewis, who himself had acquired a divine nature, through\nhis conquest of the bear, now is overpowered by his son:\n\n                 “Back retreated Mudjekeewis,\n                 Rushing westward o’er the mountains,\n                 Stumbling westward down the mountains,\n                 Three whole days retreated fighting,\n                 Still pursued by Hiawatha\n                 To the doorways of the West-Wind,\n                 To the portals of the Sunset,\n                 To the earth’s remotest border,\n                 Where into the empty spaces\n                 Sinks the sun, as a flamingo\n                 Drops into her nest at nightfall.”\n\nThe “three days” are a stereotyped form representing the stay in the sea\nprison of night. (Twenty-first until twenty-fourth of December.) Christ,\ntoo, remained three days in the underworld. “The treasure, difficult to\nattain,” is captured by the hero during this struggle in the west. In\nthis case the father must make a great concession to the son; he gives\nhim divine nature,[650] that very wind nature, the immortality of which\nalone protected Mudjekeewis from death. He says to his son:\n\n                   “I will share my kingdom with you,\n                   Ruler shall you be henceforward,\n                   Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,\n                   Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin.”\n\nThat Hiawatha now becomes ruler of the home-wind has its close parallel\nin the Gilgamesh epic, where Gilgamesh finally receives the magic herb\nfrom the wise old Utnapishtim, who dwells in the West, which brings him\nsafe once more over the sea to his home; but this, when he is home\nagain, is retaken from him by a serpent.\n\nWhen one has slain the father, one can obtain possession of his wife,\nand when one has conquered the mother, one can free one’s self.\n\nOn the return journey Hiawatha stops at the clever arrow-maker’s, who\npossesses a lovely daughter:\n\n                   “And he named her from the river,\n                   From the water-fall he named her,\n                   Minnehaha, Laughing Water.”\n\nWhen Hiawatha, in his earliest childhood dreaming, felt the sounds of\nwater and wind press upon his ears, he recognized in these sounds of\nnature the speech of his mother. The murmuring pine trees on the shore\nof the great sea, said “Minnewawa.” And above the murmuring of the winds\nand the splashing of the water he found his earliest childhood dreams\nonce again in a woman, “Minnehaha,” the laughing water. And the hero,\nbefore all others, finds in woman the mother, in order to become a child\nagain, and, finally, to solve the riddle of immortality.\n\nThe fact that Minnehaha’s father is a skilful arrow-maker betrays him as\nthe father of the hero (and the woman he had with him as the mother).\nThe father of the hero is very often a skilful carpenter, or other\nartisan. According to an Arabian legend, Tare,[651] Abraham’s father,\nwas a skilful master workman, who could carve arrows from any wood; that\nis to say, in the Arabian form of speech, he was a procreator of\nsplendid sons.[652] Moreover, he was a maker of images of gods.\nTvashtar, Agni’s father, is the maker of the world, a smith and\ncarpenter, the discoverer of fire-boring. Joseph, the father of Jesus,\nwas also a carpenter; likewise Kinyras, Adonis’s father, who is said to\nhave invented the hammer, the lever, roofing and mining. Hephaestus, the\nfather of Hermes, is an artistic master workman and sculptor. In fairy\ntales, the father of the hero is very modestly the traditional\nwood-cutter. These conceptions were also alive in the cult of Osiris.\nThere the divine image was carved out of a tree trunk and then placed\nwithin the hollow of the tree. (Frazer: “Golden Bough,” Part IV.) In\nRigveda, the world was also hewn out of a tree by the world-sculptor.\nThe idea that the hero is his own procreator[653] leads to the fact that\nhe is invested with paternal attributes, and reversedly the heroic\nattributes are given to the father. In Mânî there exists a beautiful\nunion of the motives. He accomplishes his great labors as a religious\nfounder, hides himself for years in a cave, he dies, is skinned, stuffed\nand hung up (hero). Besides he is an artist, and has a crippled foot. A\nsimilar union of motives is found in Wieland, the smith.\n\nHiawatha kept silent about what he saw at the old arrow-maker’s on his\nreturn to Nokomis, and he did nothing further to win Minnehaha. But now\nsomething happened, which, if it were not in an Indian epic, would\nrather be sought in the history of a neurosis. Hiawatha introverted his\nlibido; that is to say, he fell into an extreme resistance against the\n“real sexual demand” (Freud); he built a hut for himself in the wood, in\norder to fast there and to experience dreams and visions. For the first\nthree days he wandered, as once in his earliest youth, through a forest\nand looked at all the animals and plants:\n\n               “‘Master of life!’ he cried, desponding,\n               ‘Must our lives depend on these things?’”",
