    "paragraph": "Here Chiwantopel himself says that his journeying and wandering is a quest for that other, and for the meaning of life which lies in union with her. In the first part of this work we merely hinted gently at this possibility. The fact that the seeker is masculine and the sought-for of feminine sex is not so astonishing, because the chief object of the unconscious transference is the mother, as has probably been seen from that which we have already learned. The daughter takes a male attitude towards the mother. The genesis of this adjustment can only be suspected in our case, because objective proof is lacking. Therefore, let us rather be satisfied with inferences. \u201cShe who will understand\u201d means the mother, in the infantile language. At the same time, it also means the life companion. As is well known, the sex contrast concerns the libido but little. The sex of the object plays a surprisingly slight r\u00f4le in the estimation of the unconscious. The object itself, taken as an objective reality, is but of slight significance. (But it is of greatest importance whether the libido is transferred or introverted.) The original concrete meaning of _erfassen_, \u201cto seize,\u201d _begreifen_, \u201cto touch,\u201d etc., allows us to recognize clearly the under side of the wish\u2014to find a congenial person. But the \u201cupper\u201d intellectual half is also contained in it, and is to be taken into account at the same time. One might be inclined to assume this tendency if it were not that our culture abused the same, for the misunderstood woman has become almost proverbial, which can only be the result of a wholly distorted valuation. On the one side, our culture undervalues most extraordinarily the importance of sexuality; on the other side, sexuality breaks out as a direct result of the repression burdening it at every place where it does not belong, and makes use of such an indirect manner of expression that one may expect to meet it suddenly almost anywhere.",

    "question": "Why is the fact that the seeker is male and the sought after is female not considered surprising?",
    "answer": "The fact that the seeker is male and the sought-after is female is not surprising because the main object of unconscious transference is often the mother, and the daughter typically takes a male attitude toward the mother. This is a common psychological phenomenon observed in various contexts.",
