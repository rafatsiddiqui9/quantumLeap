{"paragraph": "We already know sufficiently well what longing and what impulse it is that attempts to clear a way for itself to the light, but that it may be realized quite clearly and irrevocably, it is shown plainly in the quotation \u201cNo, let me die,\u201d which confirms and completes all earlier remarks. The divine, the \u201cmuch-beloved,\u201d who is honored in the image of the sun, is also the goal of the longing of our poet.Byron\u2019s \u201cHeaven and Earth\u201d is a mystery founded on the following passage from Genesis, chapter vi:2: \u201cAnd it came to pass ... that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and they took them wives of all that they chose.\u201d Byron offers as a further motif for his poem the following passage from Coleridge: \u201c_And woman wailing for her Demon lover_.\u201d Byron\u2019s poem is concerned with two great events, one psychologic and one telluric; the passion which throws down all barriers; and all the terrors of the unchained powers of nature: a parallel which has already been introduced into our earlier discussion. The angels Samiasa and Azaziel burn with sinful love for the beautiful daughters of Cain, Anah and Aholibama, and force a way through the barrier which is placed between mortal and immortal. They revolt as Lucifer once did against God, and the archangel Raphael raises his voice warningly:\u201cBut man hath listened to his voice      And ye to woman\u2019s\u2014beautiful she is,      The serpent\u2019s voice less subtle than her kiss.      The snake but vanquished dust; but she will draw      A second host from heaven to break heaven\u2019s law.\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
