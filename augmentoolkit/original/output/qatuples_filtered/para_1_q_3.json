    "paragraph": "anxiety attributes, are the symbolic representations of anxiety which correspond to the repressed incest wish. It is, therefore, intelligible, when we come across the tree with the snake again and again (in Paradise the snake even tempts to sin). The snake or dragon possesses in particular the meaning of treasure guardian and defender. The phallic, as well as the feminine, meaning of the dragon[542] indicates that it is again a symbol of the sexual neutral (or bisexual) libido, that is to say, a symbol of the _libido in opposition_. In this significance the black horse, Apaosha, the demon of opposition, appears in the old Persian song, Tishtriya, where it obstructs the sources of the rain lake. The white horse Tishtriya makes two futile attempts to vanquish Apaosha; at the third attempt, with the help of Ahuramazda, he is successful.[543] Whereupon the sluices of heaven open and a fruitful rain pours down upon the earth.[544] In this song one sees very beautifully in the choice of symbol how libido is opposed to libido, will against will, the discordance of primitive man with himself, which he recognizes again in all the adversity and contrasts of external nature.",

    "question": "In the referenced old Persian song, Tishtriya, what conflict is depicted between the black and white horses, and what is the outcome?\n\n**ANSISWER:**\nIn the old Persian song, Tishtriya, the conflict is depicted between the black horse, Apaosha, the demon of opposition, and the white horse Tishtriya, who represents the will.

This leads to the opening of the sluices of heaven, allowing a fruitful rain to pour down upon the earth.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the conflict between the black and white horses in the Tishtriya song reflect the concept of opposition in primitive man?",
    "answer": "The conflict between the black horse, Apaosha, and the white horse Tishtriya in the Tishtriya song reflects the concept of opposition in primitive man, illustrating the discordance he recognizes in himself and in the external nature through the struggle and eventual victory of Tishtriya with the help of Ahuramazda. This represents the struggle between opposing forces within and without.",
