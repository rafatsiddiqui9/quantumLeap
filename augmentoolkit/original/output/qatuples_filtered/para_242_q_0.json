Then\u2014with all the ardor of my being\u2014      Forth I rushed from Time\u2019s slow apathy,     Like a pilgrim home from travel, fleeing      To the arms of rapt Eternity.\u201c_Blessed be childhood\u2019s golden dreams, their power      Hid from me Life\u2019s dismal poverty_:     _All the heart\u2019s rich germs ye brought to flower;      Things I could not reach, ye gave to me!_[794]     In thy beauty and thy light, O Nature,      Free from care and from compulsion free,     Fruitful Love attained a kingly stature,      Rich as harvests reaped in Arcady.",
