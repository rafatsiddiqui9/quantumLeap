That which they lacked was training in directed thinking, or, to express it psychoanalytically, the ancients did not succeed in tearing loose the libido which might be sublimated, from the other natural relations, and did not turn voluntarily to anthropomorphism.

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the ancient lack of cultural development compared to modern times?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that the ancients did not succeed in putting themselves in possession of the force of nature, primarily due to a lack of training in directed thinking. This indicates that they did not have the capacity to sublimate libido from other natural relations or turn to anthropomorphism voluntarily. In contrast, modern times are characterized by the mobility of libido and its capacity for transference, which are considered modern acquisitions.",
