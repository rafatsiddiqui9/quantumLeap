    "paragraph": "These definitions, as a whole, plainly reveal the fundamental features. The horse is a libido symbol, partly of phallic, partly of maternal significance, like the tree. It represents the libido in this application, that is, the libido repressed through the incest prohibition.In the Miller drama an Indian approaches the hero, ready to shoot an arrow at him. Chiwantopel, however, with a proud gesture, exposes his breast to the enemy. This idea reminds the author of the scene between Cassius and Brutus in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius C\u00e6sar.\u201d A misunderstanding has arisen between the two friends, when Brutus reproaches Cassius for withholding from him the money for the legions. Cassius, irritable and angry, breaks out into the complaint:\u201cCome, Antony, and young Octavius, come,     Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,     For Cassius is a-weary of the world:     Hated by one he loves: braved by his brother:     Check\u2019d like a bondman; _all his faults observed_:     Set in a note-book, learn\u2019d and conn\u2019d by rote,     To cast into my teeth. O I could weep     My spirit from mine eyes!\u2014There is my dagger,     And here my naked breast; within, a heart     Dearer than Plutus\u2019 mine, richer than gold:     If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth:     I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.     Strike, as thou didst at C\u00e6sar; for I know     When thou didst hate him worst, thou lov\u2019dst him better     Than ever thou lov\u2019dst Cassius.\u201dThe material here would be incomplete without mentioning the fact that this speech of Cassius shows many analogies to the agonized delirium of Cyrano (compare Part I), only Cassius is far more theatrical and overdrawn. Something childish and hysterical is in his manner. Brutus does not think of killing him, but administers a very chilling rebuke in the following dialogue:",
