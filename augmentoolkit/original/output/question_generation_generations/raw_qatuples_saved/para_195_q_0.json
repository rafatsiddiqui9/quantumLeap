    "paragraph": "With his red pillar\u2014radiant in his splendor\u2014in our skilled task is born   the son of Il\u00e2.\u201d[297]\u2014_Book III._ xxix: 1\u20133.Side by side with the unequivocal coitus symbolism we see that the Pramantha is also Agni, the created son. The Phallus is the son, or the son is the Phallus. Therefore, Agni in the Vedic mythology has the threefold character. With this we are once more connected with the above-mentioned Cabiric Father-Son-Cult. In the modern German language we have preserved echoes of the primitive symbols. A boy is designated as \u201cbengel\u201d (short, thick piece of wood). In Hessian as \u201cstift\u201d or \u201cbolzen\u201d (arrow,[298] wooden peg or stump). The Artemisia Abrotanum, which is called in German \u201cStabwurz\u201d (stick root), is called in English \u201cBoy\u2019s Love.\u201d (The vulgar designation of the penis as \u201cboy\u201d was remarked even by Grimm and others.) The ceremonial production of fire was retained in Europe as late as the nineteenth century as a superstitious custom. Kuhn mentions such a case even in the year 1828, which occurred in Germany. The solemn, magic ceremony was called the \u201cNodfyr\u201d\u2014\u201cThe fire of need\u201d[299]\u2014and the charm was chiefly used against cattle epidemics. Kuhn cites from the chronicle of Lanercost of the year 1268 an especially noteworthy case of the \u201cNodfyr,\u201d[300] the ceremonies of which plainly reveal the fundamental phallic meaning:\u201cPro fidei divin\u00e6 integritate servanda recolat lector, quod cum hoc  anno in Laodonia pestis grassaretur in pecudes armenti, quam vocant  usetati Lungessouht, quidam bestiales, habitu claustrales non animo,  docebant idiotas patri\u00e6 ignem confrictione de lignis educere et  simulacrum Priapi statuere, et per h\u00e6c bestiis succurrere. Quod cum  unus laicus Cisterciensis apud Fentone fecisset ante atrium aul\u00e6, ac  intinctis testiculis canis in aquam benedictam super animalis  sparsisset, etc.\u201d[301]",
