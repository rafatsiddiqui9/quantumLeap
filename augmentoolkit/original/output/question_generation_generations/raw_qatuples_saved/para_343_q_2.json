    "paragraph": "As this text tells us, the offerers of the sacrificial horse come in that _narrowest fissure_ between the shells of the egg of the world, at that place, where the shells _unite and where they are divided_. The fissure (_vagina_) in the maternal world soul is designated by Plato in \u201cTimaeus\u201d by \u03a7, the symbol of the cross. Indra, who as a falcon has stolen the soma (the treasure attainable with difficulty), brings, as Psychopompos, the souls to the wind, to the generating pneuma, which carries them forward to the fissure or vagina, to the point of union, to the entrance into the maternal egg. This train of thought of the Hindoo philosophy briefly and concisely summarizes the sense of innumerable myths; at the same time it is a striking example of the fact that philosophy is internally nothing else but a refined and sublimated mythology. It is brought to this refined state by the influence of the corrector of reality.[818] We have emphasized the fact that in the Miller drama the horse is the first to die, as the animal brother of the hero. (Corresponding to the early death of the half-animal Eabani, the brother friend of Gilgamesh.) This sacrificial death recalls the whole category of mythological animal sacrifices. Volumes could be filled with parallels, but we must limit ourselves here to suggestions. The sacrificial animal, where it has lost the primitive meaning of the simple sacrificial gift, and has taken a higher religious significance, stands in a close relation to both the hero and the divinity. The animal represents the god himself;[819] thus the bull[820] represents Zagreus, Dionysus and Mithra; the lamb represents Christ,[821] etc. As we are aware, the animal symbols represent the animal libido. The sacrifice of the animal means, therefore, the sacrifice of the animal nature. This is most clearly expressed in the religious legend of Attis. Attis is the son lover of the divine mother, Agdistis Cybele.",

    "question": "What does the sacrifice of an animal symbolize in religious legends, and can you provide an example from the text?",
    "answer": "The sacrifice of an animal in religious legends symbolizes the sacrifice of the animal nature. This is most clearly illustrated in the religious legend of Attis, who is the son lover of the divine mother, Agdistis Cybele. The animal sacrifice, in this context, represents the relinquishment of primal and instinctual desires, aligning the individual with a higher spiritual or divine state.",
