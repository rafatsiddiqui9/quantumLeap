    "paragraph": "\u201cFrom Naples to Livorno, the ship travelled for a night, during which  I slept more or less well,\u2014my sleep, however, is seldom deep or  dreamless. It seemed to me as if my mother\u2019s voice wakened me, just at  the end of the following dream. At first I had a vague conception of  the words, \u2018When the morning stars sang together,\u2019 which were the  praeludium of a certain confused representation of creation and of the  mighty chorals resounding through the universe. In spite of the  strange, contradictory and confused character which is peculiar to the  dream, there was mingled in it the chorus of an oratorio which has  been given by one of the foremost musical societies of New York, and  with that were also memories of Milton\u2019s \u2018Paradise Lost.\u2019 Then from  out of this whirl, there slowly emerged certain words, which arranged  themselves into three strophes and, indeed, they seemed to be in my  own handwriting on ordinary blue-lined writing paper on a page of my  old poetry book which I always carried around with me; in short, they  appeared to me exactly as some minutes later they were in reality in  my book.\u201dMiss Miller now wrote down the following poem, which she rearranged somewhat a few months later, to make it more nearly, in her opinion, like the dream original.\u201cWhen the Eternal first made Sound        A myriad ears sprang out to hear,        And throughout all the Universe        There rolled an echo deep and clear:        All glory to the God of Sound!\u201cWhen the Eternal first made Light        A myriad eyes sprang out to look,        And hearing ears and seeing eyes        Once more a mighty choral took:        All glory to the God of Light!",

    "question": "What were the original verses of the poem, and how did Miss Miller modify them?",
    "answer": "The original verses of the poem, as rearranged by Miss Miller, were:\n- \"When the Eternal first made Sound / A myriad ears sprang out to hear, / And throughout all the Universe / There rolled an echo deep and clear: / All glory to the God of Sound!\"\n- \"When the Eternal first made Light / A myriad eyes sprang out to look, / And hearing ears and seeing eyes / Once more a mighty choral took: / All glory to the God of Light!\"\n\nMiss Miller modified the poem to make it more closely align with the dream's original form, likely adjusting the phrasing and structure to better reflect the dream's content.",
