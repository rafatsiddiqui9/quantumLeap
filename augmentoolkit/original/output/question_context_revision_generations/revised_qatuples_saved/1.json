{"paragraph": "“In all the world, there is not a single one! I have sought among a  hundred tribes. I have watched a hundred moons, since I began. Can it  be that there is not a solitary being who will ever know my soul? Yes,  by the sovereign God, yes! But ten thousand moons will wax and wane  before that pure soul is born. And it is from another world that her  parents will come to this one. She will have pale skin and pale locks.  She will know sorrow before her mother bears her. Suffering will  accompany her; she will seek also, and she will find, no one who  understands her. Temptation will often assail her soul—but she will  not yield. In her dreams, I will come to her, and she will understand.  _I have kept my body inviolate._ I have come ten thousand moons before  her epoch, and she will come ten thousand moons too late. But she will  understand! There is only once in all the ten thousand moons that a  soul like hers is born.”Thereupon a green _serpent darts from the bushes, glides towards him and stings him on the arm, then attacks the horse, which succumbs first_. Then Chiwantopel says to his horse:“‘Adieu, faithful brother! Enter into rest! I have loved you, and you  have served me well. Adieu. Soon I will rejoin you!’ Then to the  snake: ‘Thanks, little sister, you have _put an end to my  wanderings_.’”Then he cried with grief and spoke his prayer:“‘Sovereign God, take me soon! I have tried to know thee, and to keep  thy law! O, do not suffer my body to fall into corruption and decay,  and to furnish the vultures with food!’ A smoking crater is perceived  at a distance, the rumbling of an earthquake is heard, followed by a  trembling of the ground.”Chiwantopel cries in the delirium of suffering, while the earth covers his body:“I have kept my body inviolate. Ah! She understands. Ja-ni-wa-ma,  Ja-ni-wa-ma, thou who comprehendeth me.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does Chiwantopel pray for as he is covered by the earth in this passage?", "answer": "As the earth covers his body, Chiwantopel cries out his final prayer to the Sovereign God, asking to be taken soon so that his body does not fall into corruption and decay, thus not providing food for vultures.
