    "paragraph": "These wise words contain, in fact, the saving thought. It is not the mother who has placed the poisonous worm in our path, but our libido itself wills to complete the course of the sun to mount from morn to noon, and, passing beyond noon, to hasten towards evening, not at war with itself, but willing the descent and the end.[785]Nietzsche\u2019s Zarathustra teaches:\u201cI praise thee, my death, the free death, which comes to me because I  want it.\u201cAnd when shall I want it?\u201cHe who has a goal and an heir wants death at the proper time for his  goal and his heir.\u201cAnd this is the great noonday, when man in the middle of his course  stands between man and superman, and celebrates his path towards  evening as his highest hope: because it is the path to a new morning.\u201cHe who is setting will bless his own going down because it is a  transition: and the sun of his knowledge will be at high noon.\u201dSiegfried conquers the father Wotan and takes possession of Brunhilde. The first object that he sees is her horse; then he believes that he beholds a mail-clad man. He cuts to pieces the protecting coat of mail of the sleeper. (Overpowering.) When he sees it is a woman, terror seizes him:\u201cMy heart doth falter and faint;          On whom shall I call          That he may help me?          Mother! Mother!          Remember me!\u201cCan this be fearing?          Oh, mother! Mother!          Thy dauntless child!          A woman lieth asleep:\u2014          And she now has taught him to fear!\u201cAwaken! Awaken!          Holiest maid!          Then life from the sweetness of lips          Will I win me\u2014          E\u2019en tho\u2019 I die in a kiss.\u201dIn the duet which follows the mother is invoked:\u201cO mother, hail!            Who gave thee thy birth!\u201d",

    "question": "What does Nietzsche's Zarathustra suggest about death and one's goals?",
    "answer": "Nietzsche's Zarathustra suggests that death is not something to be feared but can be embraced, especially if it comes at the right time to achieve one's goals. Zarathustra teaches that he praises his own death, especially if it is \"the free death\" that comes because he wants it. He also mentions that a person who has a goal and an heir should want death at the proper time to ensure the continuation of their goals and legacy.",
