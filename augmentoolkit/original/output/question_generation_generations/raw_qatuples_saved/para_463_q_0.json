    "paragraph": "In this phase of the problem lies the third great difference between Jung\u2019s interpretation of the observed phenomena and that of Freud.Jung definitely recognizes that there are many neurotic persons who clearly exhibited in their childhood the same neurotic tendencies that are later exaggerated. Also that an almost overwhelming effect on the destiny of these children is exercised by the influence of the parents, the frequent over-anxiety or tenderness, the lack of sympathy or understanding, in other words, the complexes of the parent reacting upon the child and producing in him love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate, revolt. The greater the sensitiveness and impressionability of the child, the more he will be stamped with the familial environment, and the more he will unconsciously seek to find again in the world of reality the model of his own small world with all the pleasures and satisfactions, or disappointments and unhappinesses with which it was filled.",

    "question": "What does Jung's interpretation of neurotic tendencies in children differ from Freud's in this phase of the problem?",
    "answer": "Jung's interpretation differs from Freud's in recognizing that many neurotic persons exhibit the same tendencies in childhood that are later exaggerated. Jung emphasizes the significant influence of parental behavior, such as over-anxiety or tenderness, lack of sympathy or understanding, and the resulting complexes that affect the child. He suggests that the child's sensitiveness and impressionability lead them to internalize and seek to recreate their familial environment in the real world, leading to love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate, and revolt.",
