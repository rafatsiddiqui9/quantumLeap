    "paragraph": "Through the sacrifice a fulness of power was attained, which extends up to the power of the \u201cparents.\u201d Thus the sacrifice has also the meaning of a psychologic maturation process.In the same manner that the world originated through sacrifice, through the renunciation of the retrospective mother libido, thus, according to the teachings of the Upanishads, is produced the new condition of man, which may be termed the immortal. This new condition is again attained through a sacrifice; namely, through the sacrificial horse which is given a cosmic significance in the teaching of the Upanishads. What the sacrificial horse means is told by Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad 1: 1:\u201c_Om!_\u201c1. The dawn is truly the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun his  eye, the wind his breath, his mouth the all-spreading fire, the year  is the body of the sacrificial horse. The sky is his back, the  atmosphere his body cavity, the earth the vault of his belly, the  poles are his sides, the space between the poles his ribs, the seasons  his limbs, the months and half-months his joints, day and night his  feet, the stars his bones, the clouds his flesh, the food, which he  digests, are the deserts; the rivers, his veins; liver and lungs, the  mountains; the herbs and trees, his hair; the rising sun is his  forepart, the setting sun his hind-part. When he shows his teeth, that  is lightning; when he trembles, that is thunder; when he urinates,  that is rain; his voice is speech.",

    "question": "What does the description of the sacrificial horse in the Upanishad suggest about its cosmic significance?",
    "answer": "The description of the sacrificial horse in the Upanishad suggests that it is a highly significant cosmic entity that embodies various aspects of the natural world and beyond. It is described in such a comprehensive manner that it includes elements like the dawn, sun, wind, fire, and even the stars and clouds, thereby symbolizing the entire universe and its various phenomena. This cosmic significance underscores the horse\u2019s role in the mystical and spiritual teachings of the Upanishads.",
