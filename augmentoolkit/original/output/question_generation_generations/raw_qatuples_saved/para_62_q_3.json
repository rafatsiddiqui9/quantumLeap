    "paragraph": "\u201cA third consideration which presents itself, in regard to the views  developed here, starts the query as to whether we should accept as  sufficiently effectual the universal receding of the libido from the  outer world, in order to interpret from that, the end of the world: or  whether in this case, the firmly rooted possession of the \u2018I\u2019 must not  suffice to uphold the rapport with the outer world. Then one must  either let that which we call possession of the libido (interest from  erotic sources) coincide with interest in general, or else take into  consideration the possibility that great disturbance in the  disposition of the libido can also induce a corresponding disturbance  in the possession of the \u2018I.\u2019 Now, these are the problems, which we  are still absolutely helpless and unfitted to answer. Things would be  different could we proceed from a safe fund of knowledge of instinct.  But the truth is, we have nothing of that kind at our disposal.

We recognize the popular distinction between the 'I' impulse and the sexual impulse as being in accord with the biological double role of the individual being who aspires to his own preservation as well as to the preservation of the species.
