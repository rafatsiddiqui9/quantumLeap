The star or comet plainly belongs to the birth scene as a libido symbol; Nokomis, too, comes to earth as a shooting star. M\u00f6rike\u2019s sweet poetic phantasy has devised a similar divine origin.\u201cAnd she who bore me in her womb,         And gave me food and clothing.        She was a maid\u2014a wild, brown maid,         Who looked on men with loathing.\u201cShe fleered at them and laughed out loud,         And bade no suitor tarry;        \u2018I\u2019d rather be the Wind\u2019s own bride         Than have a man and marry.\u2019\u201cThen came the Wind and held her fast         His captive, love-enchanted;        And lo, by him a merry child         Within her womb was planted.\u201dBuddha\u2019s marvellous birth story, retold by Sir Edwin Arnold, also shows traces of this.[637]\u201cMaya, the Queen ...    Dreamed a strange dream, dreamed that a star from heaven\u2014    Splendid, six-rayed, in color rosy-pearl,    Whereof the token was an Elephant    Six-tusked and white as milk of Kamadhuk\u2014    Shot through the void; and shining into her,    Entered her womb upon the right.\u201d[638]During Maya\u2019s conception a wind blows over the land:\u201cA wind blew        With unknown freshness over lands and seas.\u201d",
