    "paragraph": "If we place fire and gold as essentially similar, then a great accord is found in the attributes of the two gods. To these mystical pagan ideas there deserve to be added the probably almost contemporaneous vision of Revelation:\u201cAnd being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And in the midst  of the candlesticks[162] one like unto the son of man, clothed with a  garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden  girdle. And his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as  snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire. And his feet like unto  burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice  as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven  stars,[163] and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged  sword,[164] and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his  strength.\u201d\u2014_Rev._ i: 12 ff.\u201cAnd I looked, and beheld a white cloud, and upon the cloud I saw one  sitting like unto the son of man, having on his head a golden crown,  and in his hand a sharp sickle.\u201d[165]\u2014_Rev._ xiv: 14.\u201cAnd his eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon his head were many  diadems. And he was arrayed in a garment[166] sprinkled with blood....  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,  clothed in fine linen,[167] white and pure. And out of his mouth  proceeded a sharp sword.\u201d\u2014_Rev._ xix: 12\u201315.",

    "question": "How might the description of the son of man with \"a sharp two-edged sword\" out of his mouth be interpreted in the context of Revelation?",
    "answer": "The description of the son of man with a sharp two-edged sword out of his mouth in Revelation could be interpreted as a symbol of divine judgment and authority. The sword represents both the power to cut and the capacity to heal, suggesting a dual role of punishment and salvation. This suggests that the figure has the power to bring about change and restoration, as well as to judge and enforce divine will.",
