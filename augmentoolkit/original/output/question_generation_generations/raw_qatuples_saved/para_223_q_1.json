    "paragraph": "Besides this story of identification with Christian, there follows as a further example an extraordinarily plastic memory of the sea, evoked by the sight of a photograph of a steamboat on the high seas. (\u201cJe sentis les pulsations des machines, le soul\u00e8vement des vagues, le balancement du navire.\u201d)We may mention here the supposition that there are connected with sea journeys particularly impressive and strong memories which penetrate deeply into the soul and give an especially strong character to the surface memories through unconscious harmony. To what extent the memories assumed here agree with the above mentioned problem we shall see in the following pages.This example, following at this time, is singular: Once, while in bathing, Miss Miller wound a towel around her hair, in order to protect it from a wetting. At the same moment she had the following strong impression:\u201cIl me sembla que j\u2019\u00e9tais sur un pi\u00e9destal, une v\u00e9ritable statue  \u00e9gyptienne, avec tous ses d\u00e9tails: membres raides, un pied en avant,  la main tenant des insignes,\u201d and so on.Miss Miller identified herself, therefore, with an Egyptian statue, and naturally the foundation for this was a subjective pretension. That is to say, \u201cI am like an Egyptian statue, just as stiff, wooden, sublime and impassive,\u201d qualities for which the Egyptian statue is proverbial. One does not make such an assertion to one\u2019s self without an inner compulsion, and the correct formula might just as well be, \u201cas stiff, wooden, etc., as an Egyptian statue I might indeed be.\u201d The sight of one\u2019s own unclothed body in a bath has undeniable effects for the phantasy, which can be set at rest by the above formula.[58]The example which follows this, emphasizes the author\u2019s personal influence upon an artist:",

    "question": "How does the author suggest that the sight of one's own unclothed body in a bath can affect the phantasy (imagination)?",
    "answer": "The sight of one's own unclothed body in a bath has undeniable effects on the imagination, which can be alleviated by understanding the subjective nature of such experiences. The author suggests that recognizing the arbitrary and temporary nature of these impressions can help set the phantasy at rest.",
