    "paragraph": "In this way we pass from the realm of mother symbolism imperceptibly into the realm of male phallic symbolism. This element also lies in the tree, even in the family tree, as is distinctly shown by the medi\u00e6val family trees. From the first ancestor there grows upward, in the place of the \u201cmembrum virile,\u201d the trunk of the great tree. The bisexual symbolic character of the tree is intimated by the fact that in Latin trees have a masculine termination and a feminine gender.[450] The feminine (especially the maternal) meaning of the forest and the phallic significance of trees in dreams is well known. I mention an example.It concerns a woman who had always been nervous, and who, after many years of marriage, became ill as a result of the typical retention of the libido. She had the following dream after she had learned to know a young man of many engaging free opinions who was very pleasing to her: She found herself in a garden where stood a remarkable exotic tree with strange red fleshy flowers or fruits. She picked them and ate them. Then, to her horror, she felt that she was poisoned. This dream idea may easily be understood by means of the antique or poetic symbolism, so I can spare information as to the analytic material.",

    "question": "In the example of the woman's dream, what symbolic elements are present, and what is the resulting interpretation?",
    "answer": "In the example of the woman's dream, the symbolic elements include a garden with a remarkable exotic tree bearing strange red fleshy flowers or fruits. She picks and eats these fruits, feeling poisoned as a result. The dream is interpreted through the antique or poetic symbolism, suggesting that the red fleshy flowers or fruits represent a phallic symbol, and the act of eating them and feeling poisoned could symbolize the retention of libido and the potential for emotional or psychological distress.",
