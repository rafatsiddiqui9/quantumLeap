    "paragraph": "Miss Miller acts like Job; she says nothing, and lets the evil and the good come from the other world, from the metapsychologic. Therefore, the identification with Job is also significant in this respect. A wider, and, indeed, a very important analogy remains to be mentioned. The creative power, which love really is, rightly considered from the natural standpoint, remains as the real attribute of the Divinity, sublimated from the erotic impression; therefore, in the poem God is praised throughout as Creator.Job offers the same illustration. Satan is the destroyer of Job\u2019s fruitfulness. God is the fruitful one himself, therefore, at the end of the book, he gives forth, as an expression of his own creative power, this hymn, filled with lofty poetic beauty. In this hymn, strangely enough, two unsympathetic representatives of the animal kingdom, behemoth and the leviathan, both expressive of the crudest force conceivable in nature, are given chief consideration; the behemoth being really the phallic attribute of the God of Creation.",

    "question": "What significant analogy is mentioned in relation to God and Job?",
    "answer": "The significant analogy is that Job offers an illustration of God's creative power, where God is portrayed as the fruitful one, and Satan is depicted as the destroyer of Job\u2019s fruitfulness. This is further emphasized by God's expression of his own creative power through a hymn at the end of the book.",
