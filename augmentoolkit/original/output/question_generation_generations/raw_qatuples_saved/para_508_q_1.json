    "paragraph": "\u201cYour mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be  ashamed.\u201dStrong, unconquered cities are virgins; colonies are sons and daughters. Cities are also whores. Isaiah says of Tyre (xxiii:16):\u201cTake an harp, go about the city, thou harlot; thou hast been  forgotten.\u201dAnd:\u201cHow does it come to pass that the virtuous city has become an  harlot?\u201dThis inversion brings about a great advantage for sublimation, for it creates enormous possibilities of application for the myth-weaving phantasy, that is to say, for the annexation to the sun cycle. The Sun floats over the sea like an immortal god, which every evening is immersed in the maternal water and is born again renewed in the morning. Frobenius says:\u201cPerhaps in connection with the blood-red sunrise, the idea occurs  that here a birth takes place, the birth of a young son; the question  then arises inevitably, whence comes the paternity? How has the woman  become pregnant? And since this woman symbolizes the same idea as the  fish, which means the sea, (because we proceed from the assumption  that the Sun descends into the sea as well as arises from it) thus the  curious primitive answer is that this sea has previously swallowed the  old Sun. Consequently the resulting myth is, that the woman (sea) has  formerly devoured the Sun and now brings a new Sun into the world, and  thus she has become pregnant.\u201d",

    "question": "Isaiah refers to Tyre as a \"harlot\" in the text. What does this comparison suggest about Tyre's past and present state?",
    "answer": "Isaiah compares Tyre to a \"harlot,\" which suggests that Tyre's past was virtuous but has since declined into a state of moral degradation. The metaphor indicates a significant shift from a virtuous city to one that is now associated with sin and corruption.",
