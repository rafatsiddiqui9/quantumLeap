The remark at the\nclose of the description, “sans songer à rien de plus sérieux qu’à la\nbeauté des officiers,” and so on, diminishes the seriousness of the\nimpression, it is true. The assumption, however, that the impression\nopenly influenced the mood very much, is supported by the fact that a\npoem upon a subject of such an erotic character came forth immediately,\n“Brine, wine and damsels fine,” and in the singer’s honor. One is only\ntoo easily inclined to take such an impression lightly, and one admits\nso gladly the statements of the participators when they represent\neverything as simple and not at all serious. I dwell upon this\nimpression at length, because it is important to know that an erotic\nimpression after such an introversion, has a deep effect and is\nundervalued, possibly, by Miss Miller. The suddenly passing sickness is\nobscure and needs a psychologic interpretation which cannot be touched\nupon here because of lack of data. The phenomena now to be described can\nonly be explained as arising from a disturbance which reaches to the\nvery depths of her being.\n\n  “From Naples to Livorno, the ship travelled for a night, during which\n  I slept more or less well,—my sleep, however, is seldom deep or\n  dreamless. It seemed to me as if my mother’s voice wakened me, just at\n  the end of the following dream. At first I had a vague conception of\n  the words, ‘When the morning stars sang together,’ which were the\n  praeludium of a certain confused representation of creation and of the\n  mighty chorals resounding through the universe. In spite of the\n  strange, contradictory and confused character which is peculiar to the\n  dream, there was mingled in it the chorus of an oratorio which has\n  been given by one of the foremost musical societies of New York, and\n  with that were also memories of Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’ Then from\n  out of this whirl, there slowly emerged certain words, which arranged\n  themselves into three strophes and, indeed, they seemed to be in my\n  own handwriting on ordinary blue-lined writing paper on a page of my\n  old poetry book which I always carried around with me; in short, they\n  appeared to me exactly as some minutes later they were in reality in\n  my book.”\n\nMiss Miller now wrote down the following poem, which she rearranged\nsomewhat a few months later, to make it more nearly, in her opinion,\nlike the dream original.\n\n              “When the Eternal first made Sound\n              A myriad ears sprang out to hear,\n              And throughout all the Universe\n              There rolled an echo deep and clear:\n              All glory to the God of Sound!\n\n              “When the Eternal first made Light\n              A myriad eyes sprang out to look,\n              And hearing ears and seeing eyes\n              Once more a mighty choral took:\n              All glory to the God of Light!\n\n              “When the Eternal first gave Love\n              A myriad hearts sprang into life;\n              Ears filled with music, eyes with light;\n              Pealed forth with hearts with love all rife:\n              All glory to the God of Love!”\n\nBefore we enter upon Miss Miller’s attempt to bring to light through her\nsuppositions[64] the root of this subliminal creation, we will attempt a\nshort analytic survey of the material already in our possession. The\nimpression on the ship has already been properly emphasized, so that we\nneed have no further difficulty in gaining possession of the dynamic\nprocess which brought about this poetical revelation. It was made clear\nin the preceding paragraphs that Miss Miller possibly had not\ninconsiderably undervalued the importance of the erotic impression. This\nassumption gains in probability through experience, which shows that,\nvery generally, relatively weak erotic impressions are greatly\nundervalued. One can see this best in cases where those concerned,\neither from social or moral grounds, consider an erotic relation as\nsomething quite impossible; for example, parents and children, brothers\nand sisters, relations (homosexual) between older and younger men, and\nso on. If the impression is relatively slight, then it does not exist at\nall for the participators; if the impression is strong, then a tragic\ndependence arises, which may result in some great nonsense, or be\ncarried to any extent. This lack of understanding can go unbelievably\nfar; mothers, who see the first erections of the small son in their own\nbed, a sister who half-playfully embraces her brother, a twenty-year-old\ndaughter who still seats herself on her father’s lap, and then has\n“strange” sensations in her “abdomen.” They are all morally indignant to\nthe highest degree if one speaks of “sexuality.” Finally, our whole\neducation is carried on with the tacit agreement to know as little as\npossible of the erotic, and to spread abroad the deepest ignorance in\nregard to it. It is no wonder, therefore, that the judgment, _in\npuncto_, of the importance of an erotic impression is generally unsafe\nand inadequate.\n\nMiss Miller was under the influence of a deep erotic impression, as we\nhave seen. Because of the sum-total of the feelings aroused by this, it\ndoes not seem that this impression was more than dimly realized, for the\ndream had to contain a powerful repetition. From analytic experience,\none knows that the early dreams which patients bring for analysis are\nnone the less of especial interest, because of the fact that they bring\nout criticisms and valuations of the physician’s personality, which\npreviously, would have been asked for directly in vain. They enrich the\nconscious impression which the patient had of his physician, and often\nconcerning very important points. They are naturally erotic observations\nwhich the unconscious was forced to make, just because of the quite\nuniversal undervaluation and uncertain judgment of the relatively weak\nerotic impression. In the drastic and hyperbolic manner of expression of\nthe dream, the impression often appears in almost unintelligible form on\naccount of the immeasurable dimension of the symbol. A further\npeculiarity which seems to rest upon the historic strata of the\nunconscious, is this—that an erotic impression, to which conscious\nacknowledgment is denied, usurps an earlier and discarded transference\nand expresses itself in that. Therefore, it frequently happens, for\nexample, that among young girls at the time of their first love,\nremarkable difficulties develop in the capacity for erotic expression,\nwhich may be reduced analytically to disturbances through a regressive\nattempt at resuscitation of the father image, or the “Father-Imago.”[65]\n\nIndeed, one might presume something similar in Miss Miller’s case, for\nthe idea of the masculine creative deity is a derivation, analytically\nand historically psychologic, of the “Father-Imago,”[66] and aims, above\nall, to replace the discarded infantile father transference in such a\nway that for the individual the passing from the narrow circle of the\nfamily into the wider circle of human society may be simpler or made\neasier.\n\nIn the light of this reflection, we can see, in the poem and its\n“Praeludium,” the religious, poetically formed product of an\nintroversion depending upon the surrogate of the “Father-Imago.” In\nspite of the incomplete apperception of the effectual impression,\nessential component parts of this are included in the idea of\ncompensation, as marks, so to speak, of its origin. (Pfister has coined\nfor this the striking expression, “Law of the Return of the Complex.”)\nThe effectual impression was that of the officer singing in the night\nwatch, “When the morning stars sang together.” The idea of this opened a\nnew world to the girl. (Creation.)\n\nThis creator has created tone, then light, and then love. That the first\nto be created should have been tone, can be made clear only\nindividually, for there is no cosmogony except the Gnosis of Hermes, a\ngenerally quite unknown system, which would have such tendencies. But\nnow we might venture a conjecture, which is already apparent, and which\nsoon will be proven thoroughly, viz., the following chain of\nassociations: the singer—the singing morning stars—the God of tone—the\nCreator—the God of Light—(of the sun)—(of the fire)—and of Love.\n\nThe links of this chain are proven by the material, with the exception\nof sun and fire, which I put in parentheses, but which, however, will be\nproven through what follows in the further course of the analysis. All\nof these expressions, with one exception, belong to erotic speech. (“My\nGod, star, light; my sun, fire of love, fiery love,” etc.) “Creator”\nappears indistinct at first, but becomes understandable through the\nreference to the undertone of Eros, to the vibrating chord of Nature,\nwhich attempts to renew itself in every pair of lovers, and awaits the\nwonder of creation.\n\nMiss Miller had taken pains to disclose the unconscious creation of her\nmind to her understanding, and, indeed through a procedure which agrees\nin principle with psychoanalysis, and, therefore, leads to the same\nresults as psychoanalysis. But, as usually happens with laymen and\nbeginners, Miss Miller, because she had no knowledge of psychoanalysis,\nleft off at the thoughts which necessarily bring the deep complex lying\nat the bottom of it to light in an indirect, that is to say, censored\nmanner. More than this, a simple method, merely the carrying out of the\nthought to its conclusion, is sufficient to discover the meaning. Miss\nMiller finds it astonishing that her unconscious phantasy does not,\nfollowing the Mosaic account of creation, put light in the first place,\ninstead of tone.\n\nNow follows an explanation, theoretically constructed and correct ad\nhoc, the hollowness of which is, however, characteristic of all similar\nattempts at explanation. She says:\n\n  “It is perhaps interesting to recall that Anaxagoras also had the\n  Cosmos arise out of chaos through a sort of whirlwind, which does not\n  happen usually without producing sound.[67] But at this time I had\n  studied no philosophy, and knew nothing either of Anaxagoras or of his\n  theories about the ‘νοῦς,’ which I, unconsciously, was openly\n  following. At that time, also, I was equally in complete ignorance of\n  Leibnitz, and, therefore, knew nothing of his doctrine ‘dum Deus\n  calculat, fit mundus.’”\n\nMiss Miller’s references to Anaxagoras and to Leibnitz both refer to\ncreation by means of thought; that is to say, that divine thought alone\ncould bring forth a new material reality, a reference at first not\nintelligible, but which will soon, however, be more easily understood.\n\nWe now come to those fancies from which Miss Miller principally drew her\nunconscious creation.\n\n  “In the first place, there is the ‘Paradise Lost’ by Milton, which we\n  had at home in the edition illustrated by Doré, and which had often\n  delighted me from childhood. Then the ‘Book of Job,’ which had been\n  read aloud to me since the time of my earliest recollection. Moreover,\n  if one compares the first words of ‘Paradise Lost’ with my first\n  verse, one notices that there is the same verse measure.\n\n                    “‘Of man’s first disobedience ...\n\n                  “‘When the Eternal first made sound.’\n\n  “My poem also recalls various passages in Job, and one or two places\n  in Handel’s Oratorio ‘The Creation,’ which came out very indistinctly\n  in the first part of the dream.”[68]\n\nThe “Lost Paradise” which, as is well known, is so closely connected\nwith the beginning of the world, is made more clearly evident by the\nverse—\n\n  “Of man’s first disobedience”\n\nwhich is concerned evidently with the fall, the meaning of which need\nnot be shown any further. I know the objection which every one\nunacquainted with psychoanalysis will raise, viz., that Miss Miller\nmight just as well have chosen any other verse as an example, and that,\naccidentally, she had taken the first one that happened to appear which\nhad this content, also accidentally. As is well known, the criticism\nwhich we hear equally from our medical colleagues, and from our\npatients, is generally based on such arguments. This misunderstanding\narises from the fact that the law of causation in the psychical sphere\nis not taken seriously enough; that is to say, there are no accidents,\nno “just as wells.” It is so, and there is, therefore, a sufficient\nreason at hand why it is so. It is moreover true that Miss Miller’s poem\nis connected with the fall, wherein just that erotic component comes\nforth, the existence of which we have surmised above.",
