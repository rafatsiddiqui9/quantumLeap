    "paragraph": " But there is nothing to prove that. The first traces of Chidher are found in the commentaries of the Koran, Buch\u00e2ri and Tabare and in a commentary to a noteworthy passage of the eighteenth sura of the Koran. The eighteenth sura is entitled \u201cthe cave,\u201d that is, after the cave of the seven sleepers, who, according to the legend, slept there for 309 years, and thus escaped persecution, and awoke in a new era. Their legend is recounted in the eighteenth sura, and divers reflections were associated with it. The wish-fulfilment idea of the legend is very clear. The mystic material for it is the immutable model of the Sun\u2019s course. The Sun sets periodically, but does not die. It hides in the womb of the sea or in a subterranean cave,[368] and in the morning is \u201cborn again,\u201d complete. The language in which this astronomic occurrence is clothed is one of clear symbolism; the Sun returns into the mother\u2019s womb, and after some time is again born. Of course, this event is properly an incestuous act, of which, in mythology, clear traces are still retained, not the least of which is the circumstance that the dying and resurrected gods are the lovers of their own mothers or have generated themselves through their own mothers. Christ as the \u201cGod becoming flesh\u201d has generated himself through Mary; Mithra has done the same. These Gods are unmistakable Sun-gods, for the Sun also does this, in order to again renew himself. Naturally, it is not to be assumed that astronomy came first and these conceptions of gods afterwards; the process was, as always, inverted, and it is even true that primitive magic charms of rebirth, baptism, superstitious usages of all sorts, concerning the cure of the sick, etc., were projected into the heavens. These youths were born from the cave (the womb of mother earth), like the Sun-gods, in a new era, and this was the way they vanquished death. In this far they were immortal.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the Sun's course in the context of the legend of the seven sleepers and the rebirth of Sun-gods?",
    "answer": "The Sun's course is significant in the context of the legend of the seven sleepers and the rebirth of Sun-gods as it provides a clear symbol of renewal and rebirth. The Sun sets periodically and \"dies\" before rising again the next morning, a process that mirrors the legends of the seven sleepers and the rebirth of Sun-gods.",
