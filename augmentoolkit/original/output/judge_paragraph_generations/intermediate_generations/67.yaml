    In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude
    easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that
    are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners.
    These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much
    to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these
    interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers.
    The vastness of these mysteries spans from the minuscule quantum realm to the

    \ nothing symbolic in our every-day thought? Let us follow our trains of thought;\
    \ let us take an example. We think of the war of 1870 and 1871. We think about\
    \ a series of bloody battles, the siege of Strassburg, Belfort, Paris, the Treaty\
    \ of Peace, the foundation of the German Empire, and so on. How have we been thinking?\
    \ We start with an idea, or super-idea, as it is also called, and without thinking\
    \ of it, but each time merely guided by a feeling of direction, we think about\
    \ individual reminiscences of the war. In this we can find nothing symbolic, and\
    \ our whole conscious thinking proceeds according to this type.[13]If we observe\
    \ our thinking very narrowly, and follow an intensive train of thought, as, for\
    \ example, the solution of a difficult problem, then suddenly we notice that we\
    \ are thinking in words, that in wholly intensive thinking we begin to speak to\
    \ ourselves, or that we occasionally write down the problem, or make a drawing\
    \ of it so as to be absolutely clear. It must certainly have happened to any one\
    \ who has lived for some time in a foreign country, that after a certain period\
    \ he has begun to think in the language of the country. A very intensive train\
    \ of thinking works itself out more or less in _word form_; that is, if one wants\
    \ to express it, to teach it, or to convince any one of it. Evidently it directs\
    \ itself wholly to the outside world. To this extent, this directed or logical\
    \ thinking is a reality thinking,[14] having a real existence for us; that is\
    \ to say, a thinking which adjusts itself to actual conditions,[15] where we,\
    \ expressed in other words, imitate the succession of objectively real things,\
    \ so that the images in our mind follow after each other in the same strictly\
    \ causal succession as the historical events outside of our mind.[16]\n\"\"\"\n\
