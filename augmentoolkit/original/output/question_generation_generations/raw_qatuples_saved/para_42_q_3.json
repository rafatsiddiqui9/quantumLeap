    "paragraph": "\u201cPart of that power, not understood,     Which always wills the bad and always creates the good.\u201dUnited to this strength, Faust succeeded in accomplishing his real life task, at first through evil adventure and then for the benefit of humanity, for without the evil there is no creative power. Here in the mysterious mother scene, where the poet unveils the last mystery of the creative power to the initiated, Faust has need of the phallic magic wand (in the magic strength of which he has at first no confidence), in order to perform the greatest of wonders, namely, the creation of Paris and Helen. With that Faust attains the divine power of working miracles, and, indeed, only by means of this small, insignificant instrument. This paradoxical impression seems to be very ancient, for even the Upanishads could say the following of the dwarf god:(19) \u201cWithout hands, without feet, He moveth, He graspeth: Eyeless He  seeth, (and) earless He heareth: He knoweth what is to be known, yet  is there no knower of Him. Him call the first, mighty the Man.(20) \u201cSmaller than small, (yet) greater than great in the heart of  this creature the self doth repose ... etc.\u201d",

    "question": "What ancient belief is referenced in the passage, and what does it describe about a dwarf god?\n\n**ANSMAIN:**\nThe passage references an ancient belief described in the Upanishads about a dwarf god. It states, \"Smaller than small, (yet) greater than great in the heart of this creature the self doth repose,\" suggesting that this god is both insignificant and omnipotent, existing within all beings but not being known by them.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the central mystery of creative power that the poet unveils in the text?",
    "answer": "The central mystery of creative power that the poet unveils is that it is paradoxical and involves both the creation of good and the will of the bad. This idea is encapsulated in the phrase, \"Here in the mysterious mother scene, where the poet unveils the last mystery of the creative power to the initiated.\"",
