    "paragraph": "This is not torment which comes from without, which befalls mankind; but that he himself is the hunter, murderer, sacrificer and sacrificial knife is shown us in another of Nietzsche\u2019s poems, wherein the apparent dualism is transformed into the soul conflict through the use of the same symbolism:\u201cOh, Zarathustra,         Most cruel Nimrod!         Whilom hunter of God         The snare of all virtue,         An arrow of evil!         Now         Hunted by thyself         Thine own prey         Pierced through thyself,         Now         Alone with thee         Twofold in thine own knowledge         Mid a hundred mirrors         False to thyself,         Mid a hundred memories         Uncertain         Ailing with each wound         Shivering with each frost         Caught in thine own snares,         Self knower!         Self hangman!\u201cWhy didst thou strangle thyself         With the noose of thy wisdom?         Why hast thou enticed thyself         Into the Paradise of the old serpent?         Why hast thou crept         Into thyself, thyself?...\u201d",

    "question": "Why does the speaker ask Zarathustra why he strangled himself with the noose of his wisdom and enticed himself into the Paradise of the old serpent?",
    "answer": "The speaker asks Zarathustra these questions to draw attention to the self-inflicted nature of his internal conflict and spiritual journey. The metaphor of strangling oneself with the noose of wisdom and enticing oneself into the Paradise of the old serpent suggests that Zarathustra has made choices that have led to his current state of inner turmoil and self-reproach.",
