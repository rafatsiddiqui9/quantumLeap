This, his own self, he divided into two\n  parts, out of which husband and wife were formed.[311] With her, he\n  copulated; from this humanity sprang. She, however, pondered: ‘How may\n  he unite with me after he has created me from himself? Now I shall\n  hide!’ Then she became a cow; he, however, became a bull and mated\n  with her. From that sprang the horned cattle. Then she became a mare;\n  he, however, became a stallion; she became a she-ass; he, an ass, and\n  mated with her. From these sprang the whole-hoofed animals. She became\n  a goat; he became a buck; she became an ewe; he became a ram, and\n  mated with her. Thus were created goats and sheep. Thus it happened\n  that all that mates, even down to the ants, he created—then he\n  perceived: ‘Truly I myself am Creation, for I have created the whole\n  world!’ Thereupon he rubbed his hands (held before the mouth) so that\n  he brought forth fire from his mouth, as from the mother womb, and\n  from his hands.”\n\nWe meet here a peculiar myth of creation which requires a psychologic\ninterpretation. In the beginning the libido was undifferentiated and\nbisexual;[312] this was followed by differentiation into a male and a\nfemale component. From then on man knows what he is. Now follows a gap\nin the coherence of the thought where belongs that very resistance which\nwe have postulated above for the explanation of the urge for\nsublimation. Next follows the onanistic act of rubbing or boring (here\nfinger-sucking) transferred from the sexual zone, from which proceeds\nthe production of fire.[313] The libido here leaves its characteristic\nmanifestation as sexual function and regresses to the presexual stage,\nwhere, in conformity with the above explanation, it occupies one of the\npreliminary stages of sexuality, thereby producing, in the view\nexpressed in the Upanishad, the first human art, and from there, as\nsuggested by Kuhn’s idea of the root “manth,” perhaps the higher\nintellectual activity in general. This course of development is not\nstrange to the psychiatrist, for it is a well-known psychopathological\nfact that onanism and excessive activity of phantasy are very closely\nrelated. (The sexualizing-autonomizing of the mind through\nautoerotism[314] is so familiar a fact that examples of that are\nsuperfluous.) The course of the libido, as we may conclude from these\nstudies, originally proceeded in a similar manner as in the child, only\nin a reversed sequence. The sexual act was pushed out of its proper zone\nand was transferred into the analogous mouth zone[315]—the mouth\nreceiving the significance of the female genitals; the hand and the\nfingers, respectively, receiving the phallic meaning.[316] In this\nmanner the regressively reoccupied activity of the presexual stage is\ninvested with the sexual significance, which, indeed, it already\npossessed, in part, before, but in a wholly different sense. Certain\nfunctions of the presexual stage are found to be permanently suitable,\nand, therefore, are retained later on as sexual functions. Thus, for\nexample, the mouth zone is retained as of erotic importance, meaning\nthat its valuation is permanently fixed. Concerning the mouth, we know\nthat it also has a sexual meaning among animals, inasmuch as, for\nexample, stallions bite mares in the sexual act; also, cats, cocks, etc.\nA second significance of the mouth is as an instrument of speech, it\nserves essentially in the production of the mating call, which mostly\nrepresents the developed tones of the animal kingdom. As to the hand, we\nknow that it has the important significance of the contrectation organ\n(for example, among frogs). The frequent erotic use of the hand among\nmonkeys is well known. If there exists a resistance against the real\nsexuality, then the accumulated libido is most likely to cause a\nhyperfunction of those collaterals which are most adapted to compensate\nfor the resistance, that is to say, the nearest functions which serve\nfor the introduction of the act;[317] on one side the function of the\nhand, on the other that of the mouth. The sexual act, however, against\nwhich the opposition is directed is replaced by a similar act of the\npresexual stage, the classic case being either finger-sucking or boring.\nJust as among apes the foot can on occasions take the place of the hand,\nso the child is often uncertain in the choice of the object to suck, and\nputs the big toe in the mouth instead of the finger. This last movement\nbelongs to a Hindoo rite, only the big toe was not put in the mouth, but\nheld against the eye.[318] Through the sexual significance of the hand\nand mouth these organs, which in the presexual stage served to obtain\npleasure, are invested with a procreating power which is identical with\nthe above-mentioned destination, which aims at the external object,\nbecause it concerns the sexual or creating libido. When, through the\nactual preparation of fire, the sexual character of the libido employed\nin that is fulfilled, then the mouth zone remains without adequate\nexpression; only the hand has now reached its real, purely human goal in\nits first art.\n\nThe mouth has, as we saw, a further important function, which has just\nas much sexual relation to the object as the hand, that is to say, the\nproduction of the mating call. In opening up the autoerotic ring\n(hand-mouth),[319] where the phallic hand became the fire-producing\ntool, the libido which was directed to the mouth zone was obliged to\nseek another path of functioning, which naturally was found in the\nalready existing love call. The excess of libido entering here must have\nhad the usual results, namely, the stimulation of the newly possessed\nfunction; hence an elaboration of the mating call.\n\nWe know that from the primitive sounds human speech has developed.\nCorresponding to the psychological situation, it might be assumed that\nlanguage owes its real origin to this moment, when the impulse,\nrepressed into the presexual stage, turns to the external in order to\nfind an equivalent object there. The real thought as a conscious\nactivity is, as we saw in the first part of this book, a thinking with\npositive determination towards the external world, that is to say, a\n“speech thinking.” This sort of thinking seems to have originated at\nthat moment. It is very remarkable that this view, which was won by the\npath of reasoning, is again supported by old tradition and other\nmythological fragments.\n\nIn Aitareyopanishad[320] the following quotation is to be found in\nthe doctrine of the development of man: “Being brooded-o’er, his\nmouth hatched out, like as an egg; from out his mouth (came) speech,\nfrom speech, the fire.” In Part II, where it is depicted how the\nnewly created objects entered man, it reads: “Fire, speech becoming,\nentered in the mouth.” These quotations allow us to plainly\nrecognize the intimate connection between fire and speech.[321] In\nBrihadâranyaka-Upanishad is to be found this passage:\n\n  “‘Yayñavalkya,’ thus he spake, ‘when after the death of this man his\n  speech entereth the fire, his breath into the wind, his eye into the\n  sun, etc.’”\n\nA further quotation from the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad reads:\n\n  “But when the sun is set, O Yayñavalkya, and the moon has set, and the\n  fire is extinguished, what then serves man as light? Then speech\n  serves him as light; then, by the light of speech he sits, and moves,\n  he carries on his work, and he returns home. But when the sun is set,\n  O Yayñavalkya, and the moon is set, and the fire extinguished, and the\n  voice is dumb, what then serves man as light? Then he serves himself\n  (Atman) as light; then, by the light of himself, he sits and moves,\n  carries on his work and returns home.”\n\nIn this passage we notice that fire again stands in the closest relation\nto speech. Speech itself is called a “light,” which, in its turn, is\nreduced to the “light” of the Atman, the creating psychic force, the\nlibido. Thus the Hindoo metapsychology conceives speech and fire as\nemanations of the inner light from which we know that it is libido.\nSpeech and fire are its forms of manifestation, the first human arts,\nwhich have resulted from its transformation. This common psychologic\norigin seems also to be indicated by certain results of philology. The\nIndo-Germanic root _bhâ_ designates the idea of “to lighten, to shine.”\nThis root is found in Greek, φάω, φαίνω, φάος[322]; in old Icelandic\n_bán_ = white, in New High German _bohnen_ = to make shining. The same\nroot _bhâ_ also designates “to speak”; it is found in Sanskrit _bhan_ =\nto speak, Armenian _ban_ = word, in New High German _bann_ = to banish,\nGreek φᾱ-μί, ἔφαν, φấτις.[323] Latin _fâ-ri_, _fânum_.\n\nThe root _bhelso_, with the meanings “to ring, to bark,” is found in\nSanskrit _bhas_ = to bark and _bhâs_ = to talk, to speak; Lithuanian\n_balsas_ = voice, tone. Really _bhel-sô_ = to be bright or luminous.\nCompare Greek φάλος = bright, Lithuanian _bálti_ = to become white,\nMiddle High German _blasz_ = pale.\n\nThe root _lâ_, with the meaning of “to make sound, to bark,” is found in\nSanskrit _las_, _lásati_ = to resound; and _las_, _lásati_ = to radiate,\nto shine.\n\nThe related root _lesô_, with the meaning “desire,” is also found in\nSanskrit _las_, _lásati_ = to play; _lash_, _láshati_ = to desire. Greek\nλάσταυρος = lustful, Gothic _lustus_, New High German _Lust_, Latin\n_lascivus_.\n\nA further related root, _lásô_ = to shine, to radiate, is found in\n_las_, _lásati_ = to radiate, to shine.\n\nThis group unites, as is evident, the meanings of “to desire, to play,\nto radiate, and to sound.” A similar archaic confluence of meanings in\nthe primal libido symbolism (as we are perhaps justified in calling it)\nis found in that class of Egyptian words which are derived from the\nclosely related roots _ben_ and _bel_ and the reduplication _benben_ and\n_belbel_. The original significance of these roots is “to burst forth,\nto emerge, to extrude, to well out,” with the associated idea of\nbubbling, boiling and roundness. _Belbel_, accompanied by the sign of\nthe obelisk, of originally phallic nature, means source of light. The\nobelisk itself had besides the names of _techenu_ and _men_ also the\nname _benben_, more rarely _berber_ and _belbel_.[324] The libido\nsymbolism makes clear this connection, it seems to me.\n\nThe Indo-Germanic root _vel_, with the meaning “to wave, to undulate”\n(fire), is found in Sanskrit _ulunka_ = burning, Greek ἀλέα, Attic ἁλέα\n= warmth of the sun, Gothic _vulan_ = to undulate, Old High German and\nMiddle High German _walm_ = heat, glow.\n\nThe related Indo-Germanic root _vélkô_, with the meaning of “to lighten,\nto glow,” is found in Sanskrit _ulkă_ = firebrand, Greek Ϝελχᾶνος =\nVulcan. This same root _vel_ means also “to sound”; in Sanskrit _vâní_ =\ntone, song, music. Tschech _volati_ = to call.\n\nThe root _svénô_ = to sound, to ring, is found in Sanskrit _svan_,\n_svánati_ = to rustle, to sound; Zend _qanañt_, Latin _sonâre_, Old\nIranian _senm_, Cambrian _sain_, Latin _sonus_, Anglo-Saxon _svinsian_ =\nto resound. The related root _svénos_ = noise, sound, is found in Vedic\n_svánas_ = noise, Latin _sonor_, _sonorus_. A further related root is\n_svonós_ = tone, noise; in Old Iranian _son_ = word.",
