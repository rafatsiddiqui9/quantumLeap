Every\nobstacle which obstructs his life’s path, and threatens his ascent,\nwears the shadowy features of the “terrible mother,” who paralyzes his\nenergy with the consuming poison of the stealthy, retrospective longing.\nIn each conquest he wins again the smiling love and life-giving\nmother—images which belong to the intuitive depths of human feeling, the\nfeatures of which have become mutilated and irrecognizable through the\nprogressive development of the surface of the human mind. The stern\nnecessity of adaptation works ceaselessly to obliterate the last traces\nof these primitive landmarks of the period of the origin of the human\nmind, and to replace them along lines which are to denote more and more\nclearly the nature of real objects.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER VIII\n                             THE SACRIFICE\n\n\nAfter this long digression, let us return to Miss Miller’s vision. We\ncan now answer the question as to the significance of Siegfried’s\nlonging for Brunhilde. It is the striving of the libido away _from the\nmother towards the mother_. This paradoxical sentence may be translated\nas follows: as long as the libido is satisfied merely with phantasies,\nit moves in itself, in its own depths, in the mother.[789] When the\nlonging of our author rises in order to escape the magic circle of the\nincestuous and, therefore, pernicious, object, and it does not succeed\nin finding reality, then the object is and remains irrevocably the\nmother. Only the overcoming of the obstacles of reality brings the\ndeliverance from the mother, who is the continuous and inexhaustible\nsource of life for the creator, but death for the cowardly, timid and\nsluggish.\n\nWhoever is acquainted with psychoanalysis knows how often neurotics cry\nout against their parents. To be sure, such complaints and reproaches\nare often justified on account of the common human imperfections, but\nstill more often they are reproaches which should really be directed\ntowards themselves. Reproach and hatred are always futile attempts to\nfree one’s self apparently from the parents, but in reality from one’s\nown hindering longing for the parents. Our author proclaims through the\nmouth of her infantile hero Chiwantopel a series of insults against her\nown family. We can assume that she must renounce all these tendencies,\nbecause they contain an unrecognized wish. This hero, of many words, who\nperforms few deeds and indulges in futile yearnings, is the libido which\nhas not fulfilled its destiny, but which turns round and round in the\nkingdom of the mother, and, in spite of all its longing, accomplishes\nnothing. Only he can break this magic circle who possesses the courage\nof the will to live and the heroism to carry it through. Could this\nyearning hero-youth, Chiwantopel, but put an end to his existence, he\nwould probably rise again in the form of a brave man seeking real life.\nThis necessity imposes itself upon the dreamer as a wise counsel and\nhint of the unconscious in the following monologue of Chiwantopel. He\ncries sadly:\n\n  “In all the world, there is not a single one! I have sought among a\n  hundred tribes. I have watched a hundred moons, since I began. Can it\n  be that there is not a solitary being who will ever know my soul? Yes,\n  by the sovereign God, yes! But ten thousand moons will wax and wane\n  before that pure soul is born. And it is from another world that her\n  parents will come to this one. She will have pale skin and pale locks.\n  She will know sorrow before her mother bears her. Suffering will\n  accompany her; she will seek also, and she will find, no one who\n  understands her. Temptation will often assail her soul—but she will\n  not yield. In her dreams, I will come to her, and she will understand.\n  _I have kept my body inviolate._ I have come ten thousand moons before\n  her epoch, and she will come ten thousand moons too late. But she will\n  understand! There is only once in all the ten thousand moons that a\n  soul like hers is born.”\n\nThereupon a green _serpent darts from the bushes, glides towards him and\nstings him on the arm, then attacks the horse, which succumbs first_.\nThen Chiwantopel says to his horse:\n\n  “‘Adieu, faithful brother! Enter into rest! I have loved you, and you\n  have served me well. Adieu. Soon I will rejoin you!’ Then to the\n  snake: ‘Thanks, little sister, you have _put an end to my\n  wanderings_.’”\n\nThen he cried with grief and spoke his prayer:\n\n  “‘Sovereign God, take me soon! I have tried to know thee, and to keep\n  thy law! O, do not suffer my body to fall into corruption and decay,\n  and to furnish the vultures with food!’ A smoking crater is perceived\n  at a distance, the rumbling of an earthquake is heard, followed by a\n  trembling of the ground.”\n\nChiwantopel cries in the delirium of suffering, while the earth covers\nhis body:\n\n  “I have kept my body inviolate. Ah! She understands. Ja-ni-wa-ma,\n  Ja-ni-wa-ma, thou who comprehendeth me.”\n\nChiwantopel’s prophecy is a repetition of Longfellow’s “Hiawatha,” where\nthe poet could not escape sentimentality, and at the close of the career\nof the hero, Hiawatha, he brings in the Savior of the white people, in\nthe guise of the arriving illustrious representatives of the Christian\nreligion and morals. (One thinks of the work of redemption of the\nSpaniards in Mexico and Peru!) With this prophecy of Chiwantopel, the\npersonality of the author is again placed in the closest relation to the\nhero, and, indeed, as the real object of Chiwantopel’s longing. Most\ncertainly the hero would have married her, had she lived at his time;\nbut, unfortunately, she comes too late. The connection proves our\nprevious assertion that the libido moves round in a circle. The author\nloves herself; that is to say, she, as the hero, is sought by one who\ncomes too late. This motive of coming too late is characteristic of the\ninfantile love: the father and the mother cannot be overtaken. The\nseparation of the two personalities by ten thousand moons is a wish\nfulfilment; with that the incest relation is annulled in an effectual\nmanner. This white heroine will seek without being understood. (She is\nnot understood, because she cannot understand herself rightly.) And she\nwill not find. But in dreams, at least, they will find each other, “and\nshe will understand.” The next sentence of the text reads:\n\n  “I have kept my body inviolate.”\n\nThis proud sentence, which naturally only a woman can express, because\nman is not accustomed to boast in that direction, again confirms the\nfact that all enterprises have remained but dreams, that the body has\nremained “inviolate.” When the hero visits the heroine in a dream, it is\nclear what is meant. This assertion of the hero’s, that he has remained\ninviolate, refers back to the unsuccessful attempt upon his life in the\nprevious chapter (huntsman with the arrow), and clearly explains to us\nwhat was really meant by this assault; that is to say, the refusal of\nthe coitus phantasy. Here the wish of the unconscious obtrudes itself\nagain, after the hero had repressed it the first time, and thereupon he\npainfully and hysterically utters this monologue. “Temptation will often\nassail her soul—but it will not yield.” This very bold assertion\nreduces—noblesse oblige—the unconscious to an enormous infantile\nmegalomania, which is always the case when the libido is compelled,\nthrough similar circumstances, to regressions. “Only once in all the ten\nthousand moons is a soul born like mine!” Here the unconscious ego\nexpands to an enormous degree, evidently in order to cover with its\nboastfulness a large part of the neglected duty of life. But punishment\nfollows at its heels. Whoever prides himself too much on having\nsustained no wound in the battle of life lays himself open to the\nsuspicion that his fighting has been with words only, whilst actually he\nhas remained far away from the firing-line. This spirit is just the\nreverse of the pride of those savage women, who point with satisfaction\nto the countless scars which were given them by their men in the sexual\nfight for supremacy. In accordance with this, and in logical\ncontinuation of the same, all that follows is expressed in figurative\nspeech. The orgiastic “Occide moriturus” in its admixture with the\nreckless laughter of the Dionysian frenzy confronts us here in sorry\ndisguise with a sentimental stage trickery worthy of our posthumous\nedition of “Christian morals.” In place of the positive phallus, the\nnegative appears, and leads the hero’s horse (his libido animalis), not\nto satisfaction, but into eternal peace—also the fate of the hero. This\nend means that the mother, represented as the jaws of death, devours the\nlibido of the daughter. Therefore, instead of life and procreative\ngrowth, only phantastic self-oblivion results. This weak and inglorious\nend has no elevating or illuminating meaning so long as we consider it\nmerely as the solution of an individual erotic conflict. The fact that\nthe symbols under which the solution takes place have actually a\nsignificant aspect, reveals to us that behind the individual mask,\nbehind the veil of “individuation,” a primitive idea stands, the severe\nand serious features of which take from us the courage to consider the\nsexual meaning of the Miller symbolism as all-sufficient.\n\nIt is not to be forgotten that the _sexual phantasies of the neurotic\nand the exquisite sexual language of dreams_ are regressive phenomena.\nThe sexuality of the unconscious is not what it seems to be; _it is\nmerely a symbol_; it is a thought bright as day, clear as sunlight, a\ndecision, a step forward to every goal of life—but expressed in the\nunreal sexual language of the unconscious, and in the thought form of an\nearlier stage; a resurrection, so to speak, of earlier modes of\nadaptation. When, therefore, the unconscious pushes into the foreground\nthe coitus wish, negatively expressed, it means somewhat as follows:\nunder similar circumstances primitive man acted in such and such a\nmanner. The mode of adaptation which to-day is unconscious for us is\ncarried on by the savage Negro of the present day, whose undertakings\nbeyond those of nutrition appertain to sexuality, characterized by\nviolence and cruelty. Therefore, in view of the archaic mode of\nexpression of the Miller phantasy, we are justified in assuming the\ncorrectness of our interpretation for the lowest and nearest plane only.\nA deeper stratum of meaning underlies the earlier assertion that the\nfigure of Chiwantopel has the character of Cassius, who has a lamb as a\ncompanion. Therefore, Chiwantopel is the portion of the dreamer’s libido\nbound up with the mother (and, therefore, masculine); hence he is her\ninfantile personality, the childishness of character, which as yet is\nunable to understand that one must leave father and mother, when the\ntime is come, in order to serve the destiny of the entire personality.\nThis is outlined in Nietzsche’s words:\n\n  “Free dost thou call thyself? Thy dominant thought would I hear and\n  not that thou hast thrown off a yoke. Art thou one who had the right\n  to throw off a yoke? There are many who throw away their last value\n  when they throw away their servitude.”",
