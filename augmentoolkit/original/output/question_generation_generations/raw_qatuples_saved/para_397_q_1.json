    "paragraph": "\u201cFrom the extreme ends of these continents, from the farthest  lowlands, after having forsaken the palace of my father, I have been  wandering aimlessly during a hundred moons, always pursued by my mad  desire to find \u2018her who will understand.\u2019 With jewels I have tempted  many fair ones, with kisses I have tried to snatch the secret of their  hearts, with acts of bravery I have conquered their admiration. (He  reviews the women he has known.) Chita, the princess of my race ...  she is a little fool, vain as a peacock, having nought in her head but  jewels and perfume. Ta-nan, the young peasant, ... bah, a mere sow, no  more than a breast and a stomach, caring only for pleasure. And then  Ki-ma, the priestess, a true parrot, repeating hollow phrases learnt  from the priests; all for show, without real education or sincerity,  suspicious poseur and hypocrite!... Alas! Not one who understands me,  not one who resembles me, not one who has a soul sister to mine. There  is not one among them all who has known my soul, not one who could  read my thought; far from it; not one capable of seeking with me the  luminous summits, or of spelling with me the superhuman word, love.\u201dThat we were correct in our assumption that, in Miss Miller, it is a question of the battle for independence is shown by her statement that the hero\u2019s departure from his father\u2019s house reminds her of the fate of the young Buddha, who likewise renounced all luxury to which he was born in order to go out into the world to live out his destiny to its completion. Buddha gave the same heroic example as did Christ, who separated from his mother, and even spoke bitter words (Matthew, chap. x. v. 34):\u201cThink not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send  peace, but a sword.",

    "question": "How does the protagonist describe the women he has encountered and what does this reveal about his standards?",
    "answer": "The protagonist describes the women he has encountered as follows:\n- Chita, the princess of his race: a little fool, vain as a peacock, with no substance in her head beyond jewels and perfume.\n- Ta-nan, the young peasant: a mere sow, interested only in pleasure.\n- Ki-ma, the priestess: a true parrot, repeating hollow phrases without real education or sincerity.\n\nThis reveals that the protagonist has very high standards and is looking for someone with genuine intellectual and moral depth, not just physical or superficial qualities.",
