    "paragraph": "To-day we feel for such a thing nothing but the deepest abhorrence, and never would admit it still slumbered in our souls. Nevertheless, just as truly as the idea of the sexual assault is there, so are these things there too; which we should contemplate still more closely,\u2014not through moral eye-glasses, with horror, but with interest as a natural science, since these things are venerable relics of past culture periods. We have, even to-day, a clause in our penal code against sodomy. But that which was once so strong as to give rise to a worship among a highly developed people has probably not wholly disappeared from the human soul during the course of a few generations. We may not forget that since the symposium of Plato, in which homo-sexuality faces us on the same level with the so-called \u201cnormal sexuality,\u201d only eighty generations have passed. And what are eighty generations? They shrink to an imperceptible period of time when compared with the space of time which separates us from the homo-Neandertalensis or Heidelbergensis. I might call to mind, in this connection, some choice thoughts of the great historian Guglielmo Ferrero:[48]\u201cIt is a very common belief that the further man is separated from the  present by time, the more does he differ from us in his thoughts and  feelings; that the psychology of humanity changes from century to  century, like fashions of literature. Therefore, no sooner do we find  in past history an institution, a custom, a law or a belief a little  different from those with which we are familiar, than we immediately  search for some complex meanings, which frequently resolve themselves  into phrases of doubtful significance.",

    "question": "What do you feel about the idea of certain practices that were once considered culturally significant but are now deeply abhorrent?",
    "answer": "We feel a deep abhorrence for such practices today and would never admit that they still slumber in our souls. However, these things are still present, and they should be examined with interest as a natural science, rather than through the lens of moral horror.",
