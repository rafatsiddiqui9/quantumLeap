    "paragraph": "One might raise the objection that the mythological inclinations of children are implanted by education. The objection is futile. Has humanity at all ever broken loose from the myths? Every man has eyes and all his senses to perceive that the world is dead, cold and unending, and he has never yet seen a God, nor brought to light the existence of such from empirical necessity. On the contrary, there was need of a phantastic, indestructible optimism, and one far removed from all sense of reality, in order, for example, to discover in the shameful death of Christ really the highest salvation and the redemption of the world. Thus one can indeed withhold from a child the substance of earlier myths but not take from him the need for mythology. One can say, that should it happen that all traditions in the world were cut off with a single blow, then with the succeeding generation, the whole mythology and history of religion would start over again. Only a few individuals succeed in throwing off mythology in a time of a certain intellectual supremacy\u2014the mass never frees itself. Explanations are of no avail; they merely destroy a transitory form of manifestation, but not the creating impulse.Let us again take up our earlier train of thought.",

    "question": "What does the text imply about the universality and recurrence of mythology?",
    "answer": "The text implies that the need for mythology is universal and will recur. Even if all traditions and myths were suddenly erased, the next generation would naturally recreate and revive mythology and religious history. This indicates that the need for mythology is deeply rooted and not easily extinguished.",
