    "paragraph": "The active fructifying (upward striving) form of the libido is changed into the negative force striving downwards towards death. The hero as zodion of spring (ram, bull) conquers the depths of winter; and beyond the summer solstice is attacked by the unconscious longing for death, and is bitten by the snake. However, he himself is the snake. But he is at war with himself, and, therefore, the descent and the end appear to him as the malicious inventions of the mother of death, who in this way wishes to draw him to herself. The mysteries, however, consolingly promise that there is no contradiction[782] or disharmony when life is changed into death: \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd.Nietzsche, too, gives expression to this mystery:[783]\u201c_Here do I sit now_,        That is, I\u2019m swallowed down        By this the smallest oasis\u2014        \u2014It opened up just yawning,        Its loveliest maw agape.        Hail! hail! to that whalefish,        When he for his guests\u2019 welfare        Provided thus!\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7Hail to his belly        If he had also        Such a lovely oasis belly\u2014        The desert grows, woe to him        Who hides the desert!        Stone grinds on stone, the desert        Gulps and strangles.        The monstrous death gazes, glowing brown,        And chews\u2014his life is his chewing ...        Forget not, O man, burnt out by lust,        Thou art the stone, the desert,        Thou art death!\u201d",

    "question": "How do the mysteries offer a resolution to the hero's conflict?",
    "answer": "The mysteries consolingly promise that there is no contradiction or disharmony when life is changed into death, as indicated by the phrase \"\u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd.\" This suggests that the transformation from life to death is a natural and harmonious process.",
