(Twenty-first until twenty-fourth of December.) Christ, too, remained three days in the underworld. \u201cThe treasure, difficult to attain,\u201d is captured by the hero during this struggle in the west. In this case the father must make a great concession to the son; he gives him divine nature,[650] that very wind nature, the immortality of which alone protected Mudjekeewis from death. He says to his son:\u201cI will share my kingdom with you,          Ruler shall you be henceforward,          Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,          Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin.\u201dThat Hiawatha now becomes ruler of the home-wind has its close parallel in the Gilgamesh epic, where Gilgamesh finally receives the magic herb from the wise old Utnapishtim, who dwells in the West, which brings him safe once more over the sea to his home; but this, when he is home again, is retaken from him by a serpent.When one has slain the father, one can obtain possession of his wife, and when one has conquered the mother, one can free one\u2019s self.On the return journey Hiawatha stops at the clever arrow-maker\u2019s, who possesses a lovely daughter:\u201cAnd he named her from the river,          From the water-fall he named her,          Minnehaha, Laughing Water.\u201d",

    "question": "What significant concession does the father make to the son during their struggle, and what is the implication of this concession?",
    "answer": "The father grants the son divine nature, specifically the wind nature, which ensures the son's immortality. This concession implies that the son will be able to continue living and ruling even after his father's death, symbolizing the transfer of power and immortality.",
