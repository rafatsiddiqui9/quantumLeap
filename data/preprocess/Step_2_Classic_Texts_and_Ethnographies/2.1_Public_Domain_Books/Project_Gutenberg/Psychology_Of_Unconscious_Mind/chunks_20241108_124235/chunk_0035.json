In order to understand this possibility, we must\nrealize that when we produce from the unconscious the first to be\nbrought forth is the infantile material long lost in memory. One must,\ntherefore, take the point of view of that time in which this infantile\nmaterial was still on the surface. If now a much-honored object is\nrelated in the unconscious to the anus, then one must conclude that\nsomething of a high valuation was expressed thereby. The question is\nonly whether this corresponds to the psychology of the child. Before we\nenter upon this question, it must be stated that the anal region is very\nclosely connected with veneration. One thinks of the traditional fæces\nof the Great Mogul. An Oriental tale has the same to say of Christian\nknights, who anointed themselves with the excrement of the pope and\ncardinals in order to make themselves formidable. A patient who is\ncharacterized by a special veneration for her father had a phantasy that\nshe saw her father sitting upon the toilet in a dignified manner, and\npeople going past greeted him effusively.[357] The association of the\nanal relations by no means excludes high valuation or esteem, as is\nshown by these examples, and as is easily seen from the intimate\nconnection of fæces and gold.[358] Here the most worthless comes into\nthe closest relation with the most valuable. This also happens in\nreligious valuations. I discovered (at that time to my great\nastonishment) that a young patient, very religiously trained,\nrepresented in a dream the Crucified on the bottom of a blue-flowered\nchamber pot, namely, in the form of excrements. The contrast is so\nenormous that one must assume that the valuations of childhood must\nindeed be very different from ours. This is actually the truth. Children\nbring to the act of defecation and the products of this an esteem and\ninterest[359] which later on is possible only to the hypochondriac. We\ndo not comprehend this interest until we learn that the child very early\nconnects with it a theory of propagation.[360] The libido afflux\nprobably accounts for the enormous interest in this act. The child sees\nthat this is the way in which something is produced, in which something\ncomes out. The same child whom I reported in the little brochure “Über\nKonflikte der kindlichen Seele,” and who had a well-developed anal\ntheory of birth, like little Hans, whom Freud made known to us, later\ncontracted a habit of staying a long time on the toilet. Once the father\ngrew impatient, went to the toilet and called, “Do come out of there;\nwhat are you making?” Whereupon the answer came from within, “A little\nwagon and two ponies.” The child was making a little wagon and two\nponies, that is to say, things which at that time she especially wished\nfor. In this way one can make what one wishes, and the thing made is the\nthing wished for. The child wishes earnestly for a doll or, at heart,\nfor a real child. (That is, the child practised for his future\nbiological task, and in the way in which everything in general is\nproduced he made the doll[361] himself as representative of the child or\nof the thing wished for in general.[362]) From a patient I have learned\na parallel phantasy of her childhood. In the toilet there was a crevice\nin the wall. She phantasied that from this crevice a fairy would come\nout and present her with everything for which she wished. The “locus” is\nknown to be the place of dreams where much was wished for and created\nwhich later would no longer be suspected of having this place of origin.\nA pathological phantasy in place here is told us by Lombroso,[363]\nconcerning two insane artists. Each of them considered himself God and\nthe ruler of the world. They created or produced the world by making it\ncome forth from the rectum, just as the egg of birds originates in the\negg canal. One of these two artists was endowed with a true artistic\nsense. He painted a picture in which he was just in the act of creation;\nthe world came forth from his anus; the membrum was in full erection; he\nwas naked, surrounded by women, and with all insignia of his power. The\nexcrement is in a certain sense the thing wished for, and on that\naccount it receives the corresponding valuation. When I first understood\nthis connection, an observation made long ago, and which disturbed me\ngreatly because I never rightly understood it, became clear to me. It\nconcerned an educated patient who, under very tragic circumstances, had\nto be separated from her husband and child, and was brought into the\ninsane asylum. She exhibited a typical apathy and slovenliness which was\nconsidered as affective mental deterioration. Even at that time I\ndoubted this deterioration, and was inclined to regard it as a secondary\nadjustment. I took especial pains to ascertain how I could discover the\nexistence of the affect in this case. Finally, after more than three\nhours’ hard work, I succeeded in finding a train of thought which\nsuddenly brought the patient into a completely adequate and therefore\nstrongly emotional state. At this moment the affective connection with\nher was completely reëstablished. That happened in the forenoon. When I\nreturned at the appointed time in the evening to the ward to see her she\nhad, for my reception, smeared herself from head to foot with excrement,\nand cried laughingly, “Do I please you so?” She had never done that\nbefore; it was plainly destined for me. The impression which I received\nwas one of a personal affront and, as a result of this, I was convinced\nfor years after of the affective deterioration of such cases. Now we\nunderstand this act as an infantile ceremony of welcome or a declaration\nof love.\n\nThe origin of Chiwantopel, that is to say, an unconscious personality,\ntherefore means, in the sense of the previous explanation, “I make,\nproduce, invent him myself.” It is a sort of human creation or birth by\nthe anal route. The first people were made from excrement, potter’s\nearth, or clay. The Latin _lutum_, which really means “moistened earth,”\nalso has the transferred meaning of dirt. In Plautus it is even a term\nof abuse, something like “You scum.” The birth from the anus also\nreminds us of the motive of “throwing behind oneself.” A well-known\nexample is the oracular command, which Deucalion and Pyrrha, who were\nthe only survivors from the great flood, received. They were to throw\nbehind them the bones of the great mother. They then threw behind them\nstones, from which mankind sprang. According to a tradition, the Dactyli\nin a similar manner sprang from dust, which the nymph Anchiale threw\nbehind her. There is also humorous significance attached to the anal\nproducts. The excrements are often considered in popular humor as a\nmonument or memorial (which plays a special part in regard to the\ncriminal in the form of _grumus merdæ_); every one knows the humorous\nstory of the man who, led by the spirit through labyrinthian passages to\na hidden treasure, after he had shed all his pieces of clothing,\ndeposited excrement as a last guide post on his road. In a more distant\npast a sign of this kind possessed as great a significance as the dung\nof animals to indicate the direction taken. Simple monuments (“little\nstone figures”) have taken the place of this perishable mark.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Miss Miller quotes another case, where a name\nsuddenly obtruded itself, parallel to the emerging into consciousness of\nChiwantopel, namely, A-ha-ma-ra-ma, with the feeling that it dealt with\nsomething Assyrian.[364] As a possible source of this, there occurred to\nher “Asurabama, who made cuneiform bricks,”[365] those imperishable\ndocuments made from clay: the monuments of the most ancient history. If\nit were not emphasized that the bricks are “cuneiform,” then it might\nmean ambiguously “wedged-shaped bricks,” which is more suggestive of our\ninterpretation than that of the author.\n\nMiss Miller remarks that besides the name “Asurabama” she also thought\nof “Ahasuerus” or “Ahasverus.” This phantasy leads to a very different\naspect of the problem of the unconscious personality. While the previous\nmaterials betrayed to us something of the infantile theory of creation,\nthis phantasy opens up a vista into the dynamics of the unconscious\ncreation of personality. Ahasver is, as is well known, the Wandering\nJew; he is characterized by endless and restless wanderings until the\nend of the world. The fact that the author has thought of this\nparticular name justifies us in following this trail. The legend of\nAhasver, the first literary traces of which belong to the thirteenth\ncentury, seems to be of Occidental origin, and belongs to those ideas\nwhich possess indestructible vital energy. The figure of the Wandering\nJew has undergone more literary elaboration than the figure of Faust,\nand nearly all of this work belongs to the last century. If the figure\nis not called Ahasver, still it is there under another name, perhaps as\nCount of St. Germain, the mysterious Rosicrucian, whose immortality was\nassured, and whose temporary residence (the land) was equally\nknown.[366] Although the stories about Ahasver cannot be traced back any\nearlier than the thirteenth century, the oral tradition can reach back\nconsiderably further, and it is not an impossibility that a bridge to\nthe Orient exists. There is the parallel figure of Chidr, or “al\nChadir,” the “ever-youthful Chidher” celebrated in song by Rueckert. The\nlegend is purely Islamitic. The peculiar feature, however, is that\nChidher is not only a saint, but in Sufic circles[367] rises even to\ndivine significance. In view of the severe monotheism of Islam, one is\ninclined to think of Chidher as a pre-Islamitic Arabian divinity who\nwould hardly be officially recognized by the new religion, but might\nhave been tolerated on political grounds. But there is nothing to prove\nthat. The first traces of Chidher are found in the commentaries of the\nKoran, Buchâri and Tabare and in a commentary to a noteworthy passage of\nthe eighteenth sura of the Koran. The eighteenth sura is entitled “the\ncave,” that is, after the cave of the seven sleepers, who, according to\nthe legend, slept there for 309 years, and thus escaped persecution, and\nawoke in a new era. Their legend is recounted in the eighteenth sura,\nand divers reflections were associated with it. The wish-fulfilment idea\nof the legend is very clear. The mystic material for it is the immutable\nmodel of the Sun’s course. The Sun sets periodically, but does not die.\nIt hides in the womb of the sea or in a subterranean cave,[368] and in\nthe morning is “born again,” complete. The language in which this\nastronomic occurrence is clothed is one of clear symbolism; the Sun\nreturns into the mother’s womb, and after some time is again born. Of\ncourse, this event is properly an incestuous act, of which, in\nmythology, clear traces are still retained, not the least of which is\nthe circumstance that the dying and resurrected gods are the lovers of\ntheir own mothers or have generated themselves through their own\nmothers. Christ as the “God becoming flesh” has generated himself\nthrough Mary; Mithra has done the same. These Gods are unmistakable\nSun-gods, for the Sun also does this, in order to again renew himself.\nNaturally, it is not to be assumed that astronomy came first and these\nconceptions of gods afterwards; the process was, as always, inverted,\nand it is even true that primitive magic charms of rebirth, baptism,\nsuperstitious usages of all sorts, concerning the cure of the sick,\netc., were projected into the heavens. These youths were born from the\ncave (the womb of mother earth), like the Sun-gods, in a new era, and\nthis was the way they vanquished death. In this far they were immortal.\nIt is now interesting to see how the Koran comes, after long ethical\ncontemplations in the course of the same sura, to the following passage,\nwhich is of especial significance for the origin of the Chidher myth.\nFor this reason I quote the Koran literally:\n\n  “Remember when Moses said to his servant, ‘I will not stop till I\n  reach the confluence of the two seas, or for eighty years will I\n  journey on.’\n\n  “But when they reached their confluence they forgot their fish, and it\n  took its way in the sea at will.\n\n  “And when they had passed on, Moses said to his servant, ‘Bring us our\n  morning meal, for now we have incurred weariness from this our\n  journey.’",
