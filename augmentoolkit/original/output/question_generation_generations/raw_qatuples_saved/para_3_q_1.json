Give me your hand.BRUTUS: And my heart too.CASSIUS:         O Brutus!BRUTUS:               What\u2019s the matter?CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me        When that rash humor _which my mother gave me_        Makes me forgetful?BRUTUS:           Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth        When you are over earnest with your Brutus,        He\u2019ll think your mother chides and leave you so.",
