The entire series of individual visions is completed, as the\nauthor observes, by a confusion of sounds, somewhat resembling “wa-ma,\nwa-ma.” This has a very primitive, barbaric sound. Since we learn from\nthe author nothing of the subjective roots of this sound, nothing is\nleft us but the suspicion that this sound might be considered, taken in\nconnection with the whole, as a slight mutilation of the well-known call\nma-ma.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER VI\n               THE BATTLE FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE MOTHER\n\n\nThere now comes a pause in the production of visions by Miss Miller;\nthen the activity of the unconscious is resumed very energetically.\n\nA forest with trees and bushes appears.\n\nAfter the discussions in the preceding chapter, there is need only of a\nhint that the symbol of the forest coincides essentially with the\nmeaning of the holy tree. The holy tree is found generally in a sacred\nforest enclosure or in the garden of Paradise. The sacred grove often\ntakes the place of the taboo tree and assumes all the attributes of the\nlatter. The erotic symbolism of the garden is generally known. The\nforest, like the tree, has mythologically a maternal significance. In\nthe vision which now follows, the forest furnishes the stage upon which\nthe dramatic representation of the end of Chiwantopel is played. This\nact, therefore, takes place in or near the mother.\n\nFirst, I will give the beginning of the drama as it is in the original\ntext, up to the first attempt at sacrifice. At the beginning of the next\nchapter the reader will find the continuation, the monologue and the\nsacrificial scene. The drama begins as follows:\n\n  “The personage Chiwantopel, came from the south, on horseback; around\n  him a cloak of vivid colors, red, blue and white. An Indian in a\n  costume of doe skin, covered with beads and ornamented with feathers\n  advances, squats down and prepares to let fly an arrow at Chiwantopel.\n  The latter presents his breast in an attitude of defiance, and the\n  Indian, fascinated by that sight, slinks away and disappears within\n  the forest.”\n\nThe hero, Chiwantopel, appears on horseback. This fact seems of\nimportance, because as the further course of the drama shows (see\nChapter VIII) the horse plays no indifferent rôle, but suffers the same\ndeath as the hero, and is even called “faithful brother” by the latter.\nThese allusions point to a remarkable similarity between horse and\nrider. There seems to exist an intimate connection between the two,\nwhich guides them to the same destiny. We already have seen that the\nsymbolization of “the libido in resistance” through the “terrible\nmother” in some places runs parallel with the horse.[574] Strictly\nspeaking, it would be incorrect to say that the horse is, or means, the\nmother. The mother idea is a libido symbol, and the horse is also a\nlibido symbol, and at some points the two symbols intersect in their\nsignificances. The common feature of the two ideas lies in the libido,\nespecially in the libido repressed from incest. The hero and the horse\nappear to us in this setting like an artistic formation of the idea of\nhumanity with its repressed libido, whereby the horse acquires the\nsignificance of the animal unconscious, which appears domesticated and\nsubjected to the will of man. Agni upon the ram, Wotan upon Sleipneir,\nAhuramazda upon Angromainyu,[575] Jahwe upon the monstrous seraph,\nChrist upon the ass,[576] Dionysus upon the ass, Mithra upon the horse,\nMen upon the human-footed horse, Freir upon the golden-bristled boar,\netc., are parallel representations. The chargers of mythology are always\ninvested with great significance; they very often appear\nanthropomorphized. Thus, Men’s horse has human forelegs; Balaam’s ass,\nhuman speech; the retreating bull, upon whose back Mithra springs in\norder to strike him down, is, according to a Persian legend, actually\nthe God himself. The mock crucifix of the Palatine represents the\ncrucified with an ass’s head, perhaps in reference to the ancient legend\nthat in the temple of Jerusalem the image of an ass was worshipped. As\nDrosselbart (horse’s mane) Wotan is half-human, half-horse.[577] An old\nGerman riddle very prettily shows this unity between horse and\nhorseman.[578] “Who are the two, who travel to Thing? Together they have\nthree eyes, ten feet[579] and one tail; and thus they travel over the\nland.” Legends ascribe properties to the horse, which psychologically\nbelong to the unconscious of man; horses are clairvoyant and\nclairaudient; they show the way when the lost wanderer is helpless; they\nhave mantic powers. In the Iliad the horse prophesies evil. They hear\nthe words which the corpse speaks when it is taken to the grave—words\nwhich men cannot hear. Cæsar learned from his human-footed horse\n(probably taken from the identification of Cæsar with the Phrygian Men)\nthat he was to conquer the world. An ass prophesied to Augustus the\nvictory of Actium. The horse also sees phantoms. All these things\ncorrespond to typical manifestations of the unconscious. Therefore, it\nis perfectly intelligible that the horse, as the image of the wicked\nanimal component of man, has manifold connections with the devil. The\ndevil has a horse’s foot; in certain circumstances a horse’s form. At\ncrucial moments he suddenly shows a cloven foot (proverbial) in the same\nway as in the abduction of Hadding, Sleipneir suddenly looked out from\nbehind Wotan’s mantle.[580] Just as the nightmare rides on the sleeper,\nso does the devil, and, therefore, it is said that those who have\nnightmares are ridden by the devil. In Persian lore the devil is the\nsteed of God. The devil, like all evil things, represents sexuality.\nWitches have intercourse with him, in which case he appears in the form\nof a goat or horse. The unmistakably phallic nature of the devil is\ncommunicated to the horse as well; hence this symbol occurs in\nconnections where this is the only meaning which would furnish an\nexplanation. It is to be mentioned that Loki generates in the form of a\nhorse, just as does the devil when in horse’s form, as an old fire god.\nThus the lightning was represented theriomorphically as a horse.[581] An\nuneducated hysteric told me that as a child she had suffered from\nextreme fear of thunder, because every time the lightning flashed she\nsaw immediately afterwards a huge black horse reaching upwards as far as\nthe sky.[582] It is said in a legend that the devil, as the divinity of\nlightning, casts a horse’s foot (lightning) upon the roofs. In\naccordance with the primitive meaning of thunder as fertilizer of the\nearth, the phallic meaning is given both to lightning and the horse’s\nfoot. In mythology the horse’s foot really has the phallic function as\nin this dream. An uneducated patient who originally had been violently\nforced to coitus by her husband very often dreams (after separation)\nthat a wild horse springs upon her and kicks her in the abdomen with his\nhind foot. Plutarch has given us the following words of a prayer from\nthe Dionysus orgies:\n\n  ἐλθεῖν ἥρως Διόνυσε Ἄλιον ἐς ναὸν ἁγνὸν σὺν Χαρίτεσσιν ἐς ναὸν τῷ βοέῳ\n  ποδὶ θύων, ἄξιε ταῦρε, ἄξιε ταῦρε.[583][584]\n\nPegasus with his foot strikes out of the earth the spring Hippocrene.\nUpon a Corinthian statue of Bellerophon, which was also a fountain, the\nwater flowed out from the horse’s hoof. Balder’s horse gave rise to a\nspring through his kick. Thus the horse’s foot is the dispenser of\nfruitful moisture.[585] A legend of lower Austria, told by Jaehns,\ninforms us that a gigantic man on a white horse is sometimes seen riding\nover the mountains. This means a speedy rain. In the German legend the\ngoddess of birth, Frau Holle, appears on horseback. Pregnant women near\nconfinement are prone to give oats to a white horse from their aprons\nand to pray him to give them a speedy delivery. It was originally the\ncustom for the horse to rub against the woman’s genitals. The horse\n(like the ass) had in general the significance of a priapic animal.[586]\nHorse’s tracks are idols dispensing blessing and fertility. Horse’s\ntracks established a claim, and were of significance in determining\nboundaries, like the priaps of Latin antiquity. Like the phallic\nDactyli, a horse opened the mineral riches of the Harz Mountains with\nhis hoof. The horseshoe, an equivalent for horse’s foot,[587] brings\nluck and has apotropaic meaning. In the Netherlands an entire horse’s\nfoot is hung up in the stable to ward against sorcery. The analogous\neffect of the phallus is well known; hence the phalli at the gates. In\nparticular the horse’s leg turned lightning aside, according to the\nprinciple “similia similibus.”\n\nHorses also symbolize the wind, that is to say, the tertium\ncomparationis is again the libido symbol. The German legend recognizes\nthe wind as the wild huntsman in pursuit of the maiden. Stormy regions\nfrequently derive their names from horses, as the White Horse Mountain\nof the Lüneburger heath. The centaurs are typical wind gods, and have\nbeen represented as such by Böcklin’s artistic intuition.[588]\n\nHorses also signify fire and light. The fiery horses of Helios are an\nexample. The horses of Hector are called Xanthos (yellow, bright),\nPodargos (swift-footed), Lampos (shining) and Aithon (burning). A very\npronounced fire symbolism was represented by the mystic Quadriga,\nmentioned by Dio Chrysostomus. The supreme God always drives his chariot\nin a circle. Four horses are harnessed to the chariot. The horse driven\non the periphery moves very quickly. He has a shining coat, and bears\nupon it the signs of the planets and the Zodiac.[589] This is a\nrepresentation of the rotary fire of heaven. The second horse moves more\nslowly, and is illuminated only on one side. The third moves still more\nslowly, and the fourth rotates around himself. But once the outer horse\nset the second horse on fire with his fiery breath, and the third\nflooded the fourth with his streaming sweat. Then the horses dissolve\nand pass over into the substance of the strongest and most fiery, which\nnow becomes the charioteer. The horses also represent the four elements.\nThe catastrophe signifies the conflagration of the world and the deluge,\nwhereupon the division of the God into many parts ceases, and the divine\nunity is restored.[590] Doubtless the Quadriga may be understood\nastronomically as a _symbol of time_. We already saw in the first part\nthat the stoic representation of Fate is a fire symbol. It is,\ntherefore, a logical continuation of the thought, when time, closely\nrelated to the conception of destiny, exhibits this same libido\nsymbolism. Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad, i: 1, says:\n\n  “The morning glow verily is the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun\n  his eye, the wind his breath, the all-spreading fire his mouth, the\n  year is the belly of the sacrificial horse. The sky is his back, the\n  atmosphere the cavern of his body, the earth the vault of his belly.\n  The poles are his sides, in between the poles his ribs, the seasons\n  his limbs, the months and fortnights his joints. Days and nights are\n  his feet, stars his bones, clouds his flesh. The food he digests is\n  the deserts, the rivers are his veins, the mountains his liver and\n  lungs, the herbs and trees his hair; the rising sun is his fore part,\n  the setting sun his after part. The ocean is his kinsman, the sea his\n  cradle.”",
