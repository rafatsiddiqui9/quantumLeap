    "paragraph": "From our experience, it is hardly conceivable that a God existing outside of ourselves causes dreams, or that the dream, eo ipso, foresees the future prophetically. When we translate this into the psychologic, however, then the ancient theories sound much more reconcilable, namely, _the dream arises from a part of the mind unknown to us, but none the less important, and is concerned with the desires for the approaching day_. This psychologic formula derived from the ancient superstitious conception of dreams, is, so to speak, exactly identified with the Freudian psychology, which assumes a rising wish from the unconscious to be the source of the dream.As the old belief teaches, the Deity or the Demon speaks in symbolic speech to the sleeper, and the dream interpreter has the riddle to solve. In modern speech we say this means that the dream is a _series of images, which are apparently contradictory and nonsensical, but arise in reality from psychologic material which yields a clear meaning_.",

    "answer": "The text suggests that dreams can be understood in a modern context as a series of images that are apparently contradictory and nonsensical but arise from psychologic material that yields a clear meaning. This modern interpretation aligns with Freud's view that dreams come from the unconscious mind and represent hidden desires.",
