    "paragraph": "The basis for the unpleasantness of this idea may perhaps be found in an inner resistance in nature itself which forces man to include others in his scheme, lest his own greedy desires should serve to destroy him. But even with this inner demand and all the ethical and moral teachings of centuries it is everywhere evident that man has only very imperfectly learned that it is to his own interest to consider his neighbor and that it is impossible for him to ignore the needs of the body social of which he is a part. Externally, the recognition of the strength of the ego impulse is objectionable because of the ideal conception that self-striving and so-called selfish seeking are unworthy, ignoble and incompatible with a desirable character and must be ignored at all cost.",

    "question": "How does the author reconcile the inner demand with the external ideal of character?",
    "answer": "The author acknowledges that there is an inner demand for considering others, but the external ideal often portraying self-striving and selfish seeking as unworthy and ignoble poses a challenge. The author suggests that this internal conflict makes it difficult for individuals to practice ethical and moral behavior that considers the needs of others.",
