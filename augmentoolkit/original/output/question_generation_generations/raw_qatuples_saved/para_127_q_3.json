    "paragraph": "The student of medi\u00e6val history is familiar with the representation of the cross growing above the grave of Adam. The legend was that Adam was buried on Golgotha. Seth had planted on his grave a branch of the \u201cparadise tree,\u201d which became the cross and tree of death of Christ.[508] We all know that through Adam\u2019s guilt sin and death came into the world, and Christ through his death has redeemed us from the guilt. To the question in what had Adam\u2019s guilt consisted it is said that the unpardonable sin to be expiated by death was that he dared to pick a fruit from the paradise tree.[509] The results of this are described in an Oriental legend. One to whom it was permitted to cast one look into Paradise after the fall saw the tree there and the four streams. But the tree was withered, and in its branches lay an infant. (The mother had become pregnant.[510])",

    "answer": "The withering of the paradise tree signifies the degeneration and loss of the original, perfect state of Adam and Eve after their fall. It represents the negative consequences of Adam\u2019s sin, which brought about death and sin into the world.",
