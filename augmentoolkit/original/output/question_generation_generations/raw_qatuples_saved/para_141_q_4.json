    "paragraph": "The connection of nightmare and horse seems, at first glance, to be present also etymologically\u2014nightmare and mare. The Indo-Germanic root for m\u00e4re is _mark_. M\u00e4re is the horse, English mare; Old High German _marah_ (male horse) and _meriha_ (female horse); Old Norse _merr_ (_mara_ = nightmare); Anglo-Saxon _myre_ (_maira_). The French \u201ccauchmar\u201d comes from _calcare_ = to tread, to step (of iterative meaning, therefore, \u201cto tread\u201d or press down). It was also said of the cock who stepped upon the hen. This movement is also typical for the nightmare; therefore, it is said of King Vanlandi, \u201cMara trad han,\u201d the Mara trod on him in sleep even to death.[520] A synonym for nightmare is the \u201ctroll\u201d or \u201ctreter\u201d[521] (treader). This movement (_calcare_) is proven again by the experience of Freud and myself with children, where a special infantile sexual significance is attached to stepping or kicking.The common Aryan root _mar_ means \u201cto die\u201d; therefore, _mara_ the \u201cdead\u201d or \u201cdeath.\u201d From this results _mors_, \u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 = fate (also \u03bc\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1[522]). As is well known, the Nornes sitting under the \u201cworld-ash\u201d personify fate like Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. With the Celts the conception of the Fates probably passes into that of _matres_ and _matron\u00e6_, which had a divine significance among the Germans. A well-known passage in Julius C\u00e6sar (\u201cDe Bello Gallico,\u201d i: 50) informs us of this meaning of the mother:\u201cUt matres familias eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus[523]  declararent, utrum pr\u0153lium committi ex usu esset, nec ne.\u201d[524]",

    "question": "What is the significance of the term \"troll\" or \"treter\" in the context of nightmares, according to the text?",
    "answer": "The term \"troll\" or \"treter\" is a synonym for nightmare. It is derived from the action of treading or stepping, similar to the French \"cauchmar\" and the movement of a cock stepping on a hen. This term emphasizes the physical action associated with a nightmare, such as the feeling of pressure or treading on the body during sleep.",
