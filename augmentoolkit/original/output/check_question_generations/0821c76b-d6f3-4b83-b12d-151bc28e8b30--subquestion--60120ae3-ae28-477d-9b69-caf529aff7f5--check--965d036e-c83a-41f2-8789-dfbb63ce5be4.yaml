    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ flames for the spirit of Au. This sacrifice to  Au is a sacrifice to old departed\
    \ women.”These spirits of the hearth and fire are the souls of departed cooks\
    \ and, therefore, are called “old women.” The kitchen god develops from this pre-Buddhistic\
    \ tradition and becomes later (male sex) the ruler of the family and the _mediator\
    \ between family and god_. Thus the old feminine fire spirit becomes a species\
    \ of Logos. (Compare with this the remarks in Chapter III.)From the bull’s sperma\
    \ the progenitors of the cattle came, as well as two hundred and seventy-two species\
    \ of useful animals. According to Mînôkhired, Gayomard had destroyed the Dév Azûr,\
    \ who was considered the demon of evil appetites.[831] In spite of the efforts\
    \ of Zarathustra, this demon remained longest on the earth. He was destroyed at\
    \ last at the resurrection, like Satan in the Apocalypse of John. In another version\
    \ it is said that Angromainyus and the serpent were left until the last, so as\
    \ to be destroyed by Ahuramazda himself. According to a surmise by Kern, Zarathustra\
    \ may mean “golden-star” and be identical with Mithra. Mithra’s name is connected\
    \ with neo-Persian _Mihr_, which means “sun and love.”In Zagreus we see that the\
    \ bull is also identical with the god; hence the bull sacrifice is a god sacrifice,\
    \ but on a primitive stage. The animal symbol is, so to speak, only a part of\
    \ the hero; he sacrifices only his animal; therefore, symbolically, renounces\
    \ only his animal nature. The internal participation in the sacrifice[832] is\
    \ expressed excellently in the anguished ecstatic countenance of the bull-slaying\
    \ Mithra. He does it willingly and unwillingly[833] hence the somewhat hysterical\
    \ expression which has some similarity to the well-known mawkish countenance of\
    \ the Crucified of Guido Reni. Benndorf says:[834]\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based\

    \ to Gayomard. This demon, known as a source of evil desires, was destroyed at\
    \ the resurrection, similar to how Satan is destroyed in the Apocalypse of John.\
