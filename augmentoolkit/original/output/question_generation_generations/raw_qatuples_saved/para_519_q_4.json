    "paragraph": "(4) \u201cAnd the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colors, and  decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden  cup[432] in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her  fornication.(5) \u201cAnd upon her forehead was a name written: _Mystery. Babylon the  great. The Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth._(6) \u201cAnd I saw the woman drunken with the blood of saints, and with  the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her I wondered with  a great admiration.\u201dHere follows an interpretation of the vision unintelligible to us, from which we can only emphasize the point that the seven heads[433] of the dragon means the seven hills upon which the woman sits. This is probably a distinct allusion to Rome, the city whose temporal power oppressed the world at the time of the Revelation. The waters upon which the woman \u201cthe mother\u201d sits are \u201cpeoples and throngs and nations and tongues.\u201d This also seems to refer to Rome, for she is the mother of peoples and possessed all lands. Just as in common speech, for example, colonies are called daughters, so the people subject to Rome are like members of a family subject to the mother. In another version of the picture, the kings of the people, namely, the fathers, commit fornication with this mother. Revelation continues (xviii: 2):(2) \u201cAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the  Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,  and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and  hateful bird.(3) \u201cFor all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her  fornication.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the text imply about the future fate of Babylon (Rome) as described in Revelation 18:2?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that Babylon (Rome) has fallen and is described as the habitation of devils, the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. It also states that \"all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication,\" implying that Rome's fall has had a wide-ranging and negative impact on the world.",
