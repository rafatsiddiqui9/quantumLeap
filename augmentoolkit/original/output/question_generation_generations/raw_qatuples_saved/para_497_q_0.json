    "paragraph": "He turns, therefore, even further away, into that early youthful period, the tones of which recall Minnehaha most forcibly to his thoughts, where he learnt to hear the mother-sounds in the sounds of nature. In this very strange revival of the impressions of nature we recognize a regression to those earliest and strongest nature impressions which stand next to the subsequently extinguished, even stronger, impressions which the child received from the mother. The glamour of this feeling for her is transferred to other objects of the childish environment (father\u2019s house, playthings, etc.), from which later those magic blissful feelings proceed, which seem to be peculiar to the earliest childish memories. When, therefore, Hiawatha hides himself in the lap of nature, it is really the mother\u2019s womb, and it is to be expected that he will emerge again new-born in some form.",

    "question": "What does the author describe as a regression to early nature impressions, and what is the significance of these impressions?",
    "answer": "The author describes a regression to early nature impressions, which involve the child's strongest and earliest memories. These impressions are significant because they form the basis for later blissful feelings and memories associated with the childhood environment, such as the father\u2019s house and playthings. These memories are strongly linked to the feelings the child had for the mother, which are then transferred to other objects of the child\u2019s environment.",
