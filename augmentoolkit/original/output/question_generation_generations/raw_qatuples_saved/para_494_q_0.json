    "paragraph": "Dr. G. Stanley Hall uses a very striking symbol when he compares the mind to an iceberg floating in the ocean with one-eighth visible above the water and seven-eighths below\u2014the one-eighth above being that part called conscious and the seven-eighths below that which we call the unconscious. The influence and controlling power of the unconscious desires over our thoughts and acts are in this relative proportion. Faint glimmers of other motives and interests than those we accept or which we believe, often flit into consciousness. These indications, if studied or valued accurately, would lead to the realization that consciousness is but a single stage and but one form of expression of mind. Therefore its dictum is but one, often untrustworthy, approach to the great question as to what is man\u2019s actual psychic accomplishment, and as to what in particular is the actual soul development of the individual.A further contribution of equal importance has been the empiric development of a dynamic theory of life; the conception that life is in a state of flux\u2014movement\u2014leading either to construction or destruction. Through the development man has reached he has attained the power by means of his intelligence and understanding of definitely directing to a certain extent this life energy or libido into avenues which serve his interest and bring a real satisfaction for the present day.When man through ignorance and certain inherent tendencies fails to recognize his needs or his power to fulfil them, or to adapt himself to the conditions of reality of the present time, there is then produced that reanimation of infantile paths by which an attempt is made to gain fulfilment or satisfaction through the production of symptoms or attitudes.",

    "question": "How does Dr. G. Stanley Hall describe the mind in relation to an iceberg, and what does this analogy imply about the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind?",
    "answer": "Dr. G. Stanley Hall describes the mind as an iceberg floating in the ocean, where one-eighth of the iceberg is visible above the water and seven-eighths is below. This analogy implies that the conscious part of the mind is the small portion visible above the water, while the vast majority of the mind, which influences our thoughts and actions, is the unconscious part below the water.",
