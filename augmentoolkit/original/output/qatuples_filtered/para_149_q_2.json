    "paragraph": "My foregoing proposition of the replacement of the disturbed function of reality by an archaic surrogate is supported by an excellent paradox of Spielrein\u2019s. She says: \u201cI often had the illusion that these patients might be simply victims of a folk superstition.\u201d As a matter of fact, patients substitute phantasies for reality, phantasies similar to the actually incorrect mental products of the past, which, however, were once the view of reality. As the Zosimos vision shows, the old superstitions were symbols[277] which permitted transitions to the most remote territory. This must have been very expedient for certain archaic periods, for by this means convenient bridges were offered to lead a partial amount of libido over into the mental realm. Evidently Spielrein thinks of a similar biological meaning of the symbols when she says:[278]\u201cThus a symbol seems to me to owe its origin in general to the  tendency of a complex for dissolution in the common totality of  thought.... The complex is robbed by that of the personal element....  This tendency towards dissolution (transformation) of every individual  complex is the motive for poetry, painting, for every sort of art.\u201d",

    "question": "What does Dr. Spielrein believe about the origin of symbols according to the text?",
    "answer": "Dr. Spielrein believes that symbols generally originate from the tendency of a complex for dissolution in the common totality of thought. This means that complexes lose their individual personal elements, leading to the creation of symbols. This tendency towards the dissolution (or transformation) of every individual complex is seen as the motive behind various forms of creative expression, such as poetry, painting, and other arts.",
