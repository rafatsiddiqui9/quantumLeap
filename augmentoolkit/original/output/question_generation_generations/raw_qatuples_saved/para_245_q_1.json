On the  Sicilian coast, in the harbor of Catania, I wrote a sailor\u2019s song  which was very similar to a song well known on the sea, (Brine, wine  and damsels fine). The Italians in general all sing very well, and one  of the officers who sang on deck during night watch, had made a great  impression upon me and had given me the idea of writing some words  adapted to his melody.

I  recovered to such an extent, however, that I could go on land to visit  the sights of the city in a carriage. This day tired me very much, and  since we had planned to see Pisa the following day, I went on board  early in the evening and soon lay down to sleep without thinking of  anything more serious than the beauty of the officers and the ugliness  of the Italian beggars.\u201d",
