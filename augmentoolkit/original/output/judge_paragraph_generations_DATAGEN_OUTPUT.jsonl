We surmise, rather than know, that this battle has really something to do with creation, with the struggles between negations and affirmations. The references to Rostand’s “Cyrano” through the identification with Christian, to Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” to the sorrows of Job, misunderstood by his friends, betray plainly that in the soul of the poet something was identified with these ideas.

Among the Manichaeans God was really the sun. One of the most remarkable works extant, where the Pagan, Asiatic, Hellenic and Christian intermingle, is the Ἐξήγησις περὶ των ἐν Περσίδι πραχθέντων, edited by Wirth.[182] This is a book of fables, but, nevertheless, a mine for near-Christian phantasies, which gives a profound insight into Christian symbolism. In this is found the following magical dedication: Διὶ Ἡλίῳ θεῳ μεγάλῳ βασιλεῖ Ἰησοῦ—.[183] In certain parts of Armenia the rising sun is still worshipped by Christians, that “it may let its foot rest upon the faces of the worshippers.”[184] The foot occurs as an anthropomorphic attribute, and we have already met the theriomorphic attribute in the feathers and the sun phallus. Other comparisons of the sun’s ray, as knife, sword, arrow, and so on, have also, as we have learned from the psychology of the dream, a phallic meaning at bottom.

A certain inclination to listen to these low nocturnal voices must be assumed; otherwise such fine and hardly perceptible inner experiences pass unnoticed. We recognize in this listening a current of the libido leading inward and beginning to flow towards a still invisible, mysterious goal. It seems that the libido has suddenly discovered an object in the depths of the unconscious which powerfully attracts it. The life of man, turned wholly to the external by nature, does not ordinarily permit such introversion; there must, therefore, be surmised a certain exceptional condition, that is to say, a lack of external objects, which compels the individual to seek a substitute for them in his own soul. It is, however, difficult to imagine that this rich world has become too poor to offer an object for the love of human atoms; nor can the world and its objects be held accountable for this lack. It offers boundless opportunities for every one. It is rather the _incapacity to love which robs mankind of his possibilities_. This world is empty to him alone who does not understand how to direct his libido towards objects, and to render them alive and beautiful for himself, for Beauty does not indeed lie in things, but in the feeling that we give to them. That which compels us to create a substitute for ourselves is not the external lack of objects, but our incapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of ourselves. Certainly the difficulties of the conditions of life and the adversities of the struggle for existence may oppress us, yet even adverse external situations would not hinder the giving out of the libido; on the contrary, they may spur us on to the greatest exertions, whereby we bring our whole libido into reality.\n\"\"\"\n\nNote that even blunt facts can be suitable for questions, and unconventional knowledge is not necessarily unsuitable.

Let us translate this mythologic projection back into the psychologic, from whence it originated. Then it would read: the power of the good and reasonable ruling the world wisely is threatened by the chaotic primitive power of passion; therefore passion must be exterminated; that is to say, projected into mythology. The race of Cain and the whole sinful world must be destroyed from the roots by the deluge. It is the inevitable result of that sinful passion which has broken through all barriers. Its counterpart is the sea and the waters of the deep and the floods of rain,[191] the generating, fructifying and “maternal waters,” as the Indian mythology refers to them. Now they leave their natural bounds and surge over the mountain tops, engulfing all living things; for passion destroys itself. The libido is God and Devil. With the destruction of the sinfulness of the libido an essential portion of the libido would be destroyed. Through the loss of the Devil, God himself suffered a considerable loss, somewhat like an amputation upon the body of the Divinity.

All these symbols represent the liberation of the libido from the incestuous fixation through which new life is attained. The liberation is accomplished under symbols, which represent the activity of the incest wish.It might be justifiable at this place to cast a glance upon psychoanalysis as a method of treatment. In practical analysis it is important, first of all, to discover the libido lost from the control of consciousness. (It often happens to the libido as with the fish of Moses in the Mohammedan legend; it sometimes “takes its course in a marvellous manner into the sea.”) Freud says in his important article, “Zur Dynamik der Übertragung”:[784]“The libido has retreated into regression and again revives the  infantile images.”This means, mythologically, that the sun is devoured by the serpent of the night, the treasure is concealed and guarded by the dragon: substitution of a present mode of adaptation by an infantile mode, which is represented by the corresponding neurotic symptoms. Freud continues:“Thither the analytic treatment follows it and endeavors to seek out  the libido again, to render it accessible to consciousness, and  finally to make it serviceable to reality. Whenever the analytic  investigation touches upon the libido, withdrawn into its  hiding-place, a struggle must break out; all the forces, which have  caused the regression of the libido, will rise up as resistance  against the work, in order to preserve this new condition.”\n\"\"\"\n\nNote that even blunt facts can be suitable for questions, and unconventional knowledge is not necessarily unsuitable.

But this must be done by the god, as is shown with remarkable clearness and candor in the pious Egyptian mythology, which has preserved the most ancient and simple concepts. Thus Chnum, the “moulder,” the “potter,” the “architect,” moulds his egg upon the potter’s wheel, for he is “the immortal growth,” “the reproduction of himself and his own rebirth, the creator of the egg, which emerged from the primitive waters.” In the Book of the Dead it says:“I am the sublime falcon (the Sun-god), which has come forth from his  egg.”Another passage in the Book of the Dead reads:“I am the creator of Nun, who has taken his place in the underworld.  My nest is not seen and my egg is not broken.”A further passage reads:“that great and noble god in his egg: who is his own originator of  that which has arisen from him.”[532]Therefore, the god Nagaga-uer is also called the “great cackler.” (Book of the Dead.) “I cackle like a goose and I whistle like a falcon.” The mother is reproached with the incest prohibition as an act of wilful maliciousness by which she excludes the son from immortality. Therefore, a god must at least rebel, overpower and chastise the mother. (Compare Adam and Lilith, above.) The “overpowering” signifies incestuous rape.[533] Herodotus[534] has preserved for us a valuable fragment of this religious phantasy.“And how they celebrate their feast to Isis in the city of Busiris, I  have already previously remarked.

I have sought among a  hundred tribes. I have watched a hundred moons, since I began. Can it  be that there is not a solitary being who will ever know my soul? Yes,  by the sovereign God, yes! But ten thousand moons will wax and wane  before that pure soul is born. And it is from another world that her  parents will come to this one. She will have pale skin and pale locks.  She will know sorrow before her mother bears her. Suffering will  accompany her; she will seek also, and she will find, no one who  understands her. Temptation will often assail her soul—but she will  not yield. In her dreams, I will come to her, and she will understand.  _I have kept my body inviolate._ I have come ten thousand moons before  her epoch, and she will come ten thousand moons too late. But she will  understand! There is only once in all the ten thousand moons that a  soul like hers is born.”Thereupon a green _serpent darts from the bushes, glides towards him and stings him on the arm, then attacks the horse, which succumbs first_. Then Chiwantopel says to his horse:“‘Adieu, faithful brother! Enter into rest! I have loved you, and you  have served me well. Adieu. Soon I will rejoin you!’ Then to the  snake: ‘Thanks, little sister, you have _put an end to my  wanderings_.’”Then he cried with grief and spoke his prayer:“‘Sovereign God, take me soon! I have tried to know thee, and to keep  thy law! O, do not suffer my body to fall into corruption and decay,  and to furnish the vultures with food!’ A smoking crater is perceived  at a distance, the rumbling of an earthquake is heard, followed by a  trembling of the ground.”Chiwantopel cries in the delirium of suffering, while the earth covers his body:“I have kept my body inviolate. Ah! She understands. Ja-ni-wa-ma,  Ja-ni-wa-ma, thou who comprehendeth me.”\n\"\"\"\n\nNote that even blunt facts can be suitable for questions, and unconventional knowledge is not necessarily unsuitable.

That is to say, that driving strength of our own soul, which we call libido, and whose nature it is to allow the useful and injurious, the good and the bad to proceed. That this comparison is no mere play of words is taught us by the mystics. When by looking inwards (introversion) and going down into the depths of their own being they find “in their heart” the image of the Sun, they find their own love or libido, which with reason, I might say with physical reason, is called the Sun; for our source of energy and life is the Sun. Thus our life substance, as an energic process, is entirely Sun. Of what special sort this “Sun energy” seen inwardly by the mystic is, is shown by an example taken from the Hindoo mythology.[206] From the explanation of Part III of the “Shvetâshvataropanishad” we take the following quotation, which relates to the Rudra:[207]\n\"\"\"\n\nNote that even blunt facts can be suitable for questions, and unconventional knowledge is not necessarily unsuitable.
