Suddenly the following poem took possession of her mind._The Moth to the Sun_\u201cI longed for thee when first I crawled to consciousness.    My dreams were all of thee when in the chrysalis I lay.    Oft myriads of my kind beat out their lives    Against some feeble spark once caught from thee.    And one hour more\u2014and my poor life is gone;    Yet my last effort, as my first desire, shall be    But to approach thy glory; then, having gained    One raptured glance, I\u2019ll die content.    For I, the source of beauty, warmth and life    Have in his perfect splendor once beheld.\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
