    "paragraph": "Jodl[23] denies the identity of language and thought, because, for one reason, one and the same psychic fact might be expressed in different languages in different ways. From that he draws the conclusion that a \u201csuper-language thinking\u201d exists. Certainly there is such a thing, whether with Erdmann one considers it \u201chypologisch,\u201d or with Jodl as \u201csuper-language.\u201d Only this is not logical thinking. My conception of it agrees with the noteworthy contribution made by Baldwin, which I will quote here word for word.[24]\u201cThe transmission from pre-judgmental to judgmental meaning is just  that from knowledge which has social confirmation to that which gets  along without it. The meanings utilized for judgment are those already  developed in their presuppositions and applications through the  confirmation of social intercourse. Thus, the personal judgment,  trained in the methods of social rendering, and disciplined by the  interaction of its social world, projects its content into that world  again. In other words, the platform for all movement into the  assertion of individual judgment\u2014the level from which new experience  is utilized\u2014is already and always socialized; and it is just this  movement that we find reflected in the actual results as the sense of  the \u2018appropriateness\u2019 or synomic character of the meaning rendered.",

    "question": "How does Baldwin describe the role of the social world in the process of judgmental meaning?",
    "answer": "Baldwin describes the social world as the platform for the movement into the assertion of individual judgment. This means that the level from which new experiences are utilized is already and always socialized. The sense of \"appropriateness\" or the synomic character of the meaning rendered is a reflection of this socialization, as it is rooted in the social interactions and confirmations within the social world.",
