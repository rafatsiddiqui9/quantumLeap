    "paragraph": "Therefore he sent the Spirit unto them,    And the house trembled, solemnly;    And, with distant thunder,    The storm of God rolled over the cowering heads    Where, deep in thought,    The heroes of death were assembled....    Now, when he, in parting,    Appeared once more before them,    Then the kingly day, the day of the sun, was put out,    And the gleaming sceptre, formed of his rays,    Was broken\u2014and suffered like a god itself.    Yet it shall return and glow again    When the right time comes.\u201dIt corresponds to the phallic nature of the ass\u2019s jawbone, that at the place where Samson threw it God caused a spring to gush forth[800] (springs from the horse\u2019s tread, footsteps, horse\u2019s hoof). To this relation of meanings belongs the magic wand, the sceptre in general. \u03a3\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd belongs to \u03c3\u03ba\u1fb6\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c3\u03ba\u03ae\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd = staff; \u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 = stormwind; Latin _scapus_ = shaft, stock, scapula, shoulder; Old High German _Scaft_ = spear, lance.[801] We meet once more in this compilation those connections which are already well known to us: Sun-phallus as tube of the winds, lance and shoulder-blade.The passage from Asia through Patmos to the Christian mysteries in the poem of H\u00f6lderlin is apparently a superficial connection, but in reality a very ingenious train of thought; namely, the entrance into death and the land beyond as a self-sacrifice of the hero, for the attainment of immortality. At this time, when the sun has set, when love is apparently dead, man awaits in mysterious joy the renewal of all life:\u201c... And Joy it was        From now on        To live in the loving night and see        The eyes of innocence hold the unchanging        Depths of all wisdom.\u201d",

    "question": "What is the significance of the sun setting in the context of the passage?",
    "answer": "The setting of the sun in the passage symbolizes the end of a cycle and the apparent death of love. However, it also represents a mysterious joy and the anticipation of the renewal of all life, as the speaker awaits the renewal of all wisdom and innocence in the loving night.",
