This\nimage was the first, and was profoundly entitled to become the symbolic\ncarrier of human destiny; in the morning of life man painfully tears\nhimself loose from the mother, from the domestic hearth, to rise through\nbattle to his heights. Not seeing his worst enemy in front of him, but\nbearing him within himself as a deadly longing for the depths within,\nfor drowning in his own source, for becoming absorbed into the mother,\nhis life is a constant struggle with death, a violent and transitory\ndelivery from the always lurking night. This death is no external enemy,\nbut a deep personal longing for quiet and for the profound peace of\nnon-existence, for a dreamless sleep in the ebb and flow of the sea of\nlife. Even in his highest endeavor for harmony and equilibrium, for\nphilosophic depths and artistic enthusiasm, he seeks death, immobility,\nsatiety and rest. If, like Peirithoos, he tarries too long in this place\nof rest and peace, he is overcome by torpidity, and the poison of the\nserpent paralyzes him for all time. If he is to live he must fight and\nsacrifice his longing for the past, in order to rise to his own heights.\nAnd having reached the noonday heights, he must also _sacrifice the love\nfor his own achievement_, for he may not loiter. The sun also sacrifices\nits greatest strength in order to hasten onwards to the fruits of\nautumn, which are the seeds of immortality; fulfilled in children, in\nworks, in posthumous fame, in a new order of things, all of which in\ntheir turn begin and complete the sun’s course over again.\n\nThe “Song of Hiawatha” contains, as these extracts show, a material\nwhich is very well adapted to bring into play the abundance of ancient\nsymbolic possibilities, latent in the human mind, and to stimulate it to\nthe creation of mythologic figures. But the products always contain the\nsame old problems of humanity, which rise again and again in new\nsymbolic disguise from the shadowy world of the unconscious. Thus Miss\nMiller is reminded through the longing of Chiwantopel, of another mythic\ncycle which appeared in the form of Wagner’s “Siegfried.” Especially is\nthis shown in the passage in Chiwantopel’s monologue, where he exclaims,\n“There is not one who understands me, not one who resembles me, not one\nwho has a soul sister to mine.” Miss Miller observes that the sentiment\nof this passage has the greatest analogy with the feelings which\nSiegfried experienced for Brunhilde.\n\nThis analogy causes us to cast a glance at the song of Siegfried,\nespecially at the relation of Siegfried and Brunhilde. It is a\nwell-recognized fact that Brunhilde, the Valkyr, gives protection to the\nbirth (incestuous) of Siegfried, but while Sieglinde is the human\nmother, Brunhilde has the rôle of “spiritual mother” (mother-imago);\nhowever, unlike Hera towards Hercules, she is not a pursuer, but\nbenevolent. This sin, in which she is an accomplice, by means of the\nhelp she renders, is the reason for her banishment by Wotan. The strange\nbirth of Siegfried from the sister-wife distinguishes him as Horus, as\nthe _reborn son_, a reincarnation of the retreating Osiris—Wotan. The\nbirth of the young son, of the hero, results, indeed, from mankind, who,\nhowever, are merely the human bearers of the cosmic symbolism. Thus the\nbirth is protected by the spirit mother (Hera, Lilith): she sends\nSieglinde with the child in her womb (Mary’s flight) on the “night\njourney on the sea” to the east:\n\n                    “Onward, hasten;\n                    Turn to the East.\n\n                           ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n                    O woman, thou cherishest\n                    The sublimest hero of the world\n                    In thy sheltering womb.”\n\nThe motive of dismemberment is found again in the broken sword of\nSiegmund, which was kept for Siegfried. From the dismemberment life is\npieced together again. (The Medea wonder.) Just as a smith forges the\npieces together, so is the dismembered dead again put together. (This\ncomparison is also found in “Timaios” of Plato: the parts of the world\njoined together with pegs.) In the Rigveda, 10, 72, the creator of the\nworld, Brahmanaspati, is a smith.\n\n                    “Brahmanaspati, as a blacksmith,\n                    Welded the world together.”\n\nThe sword has the significance of the phallic sun power; therefore, a\nsword proceeds from the mouth of the apocalyptic Christ; that is to say,\nthe procreative fire, the word, or the procreative Logos. In Rigveda,\nBrahmanaspati is also a prayer-word, which possessed an ancient creative\nsignificance:[697]\n\n        “And this prayer of the singers, expanding from itself,\n        Became a cow, which was already there before the world,\n        Dwelling together in the womb of this god,\n        Foster-children of the same keeper are the gods.”\n\n                           —_Rigveda_ x: 31.\n\nThe Logos became a cow; that is to say, the mother, who is pregnant with\nthe gods. (In Christian uncanonical phantasies, where the Holy Ghost has\nfeminine significance, we have the well-known motive of the two mothers,\nthe earthly mother, Mary, and the spiritual mother, the Holy Ghost.) The\ntransformation of the Logos into the mother is not remarkable in itself,\nbecause the origin of the phenomenon fire-speech seems to be the\nmother-libido, according to the discussion in the earlier chapter. The\n_spiritual is the mother-libido_. The significance of the sword, in the\nSanskrit conception, têjas, is probably partly determined by its\nsharpness, as is shown above, in its connection with the libido\nconception. The motive of pursuit (the pursuing Sieglinde, analogous to\nLeto) is not here bound up with the spiritual mother, but with Wotan,\ntherefore corresponding to the Linos legend, where the father of the\nwife is also the pursuer. Wotan is also the father of Brunhilde.\nBrunhilde stands in a peculiar relation to Wotan. Brunhilde says to\nWotan:\n\n  “Thou speakest to the will of Wotan By telling me what thou wishest:\n  Who ... am I Were I not thy will?”\n\n  _Wotan_:\n\n  I take counsel only with myself, When I speak with thee....\n\nBrunhilde is also somewhat the “angel of the face,” that creative will\nor word,[698] emanating from God, also the Logos, which became the\nchild-bearing woman. God created the world through his word; that is to\nsay, his mother, the woman who is to bring him forth again. (He lays his\nown egg.) This peculiar conception, it seems to me, can be explained by\nassuming that the libido overflowing into speech (thought) has preserved\nits sexual character to an extraordinary degree as a result of the\ninherent inertia. In this way the “word” had to execute and fulfil all\nthat was denied to the sexual wish; namely, the return into the mother,\nin order to attain eternal duration. The “word” fulfils this wish by\nitself becoming the daughter, the wife, the mother of the God, who\nbrings him forth anew.[699]\n\nWagner has this idea vaguely in his mind in Wotan’s lament over\nBrunhilde:\n\n                  “None as she knew my inmost thought;\n                  None knew the source of my will\n                  As she;\n                  She herself was\n                  The creating womb of my wish;\n                  And so now she has broken\n                  The blessed union!”\n\nBrunhilde’s sin is the favoring of Siegmund, but, behind this, lies\nincest: this is projected into the brother-sister relation of Siegmund\nand Sieglinde; in reality, and archaically expressed, Wotan, the father,\nhas entered into his self-created daughter, in order to rejuvenate\nhimself. But this fact must, of course, be veiled. Wotan is rightly\nindignant with Brunhilde, for she has taken the Isis rôle and through\nthe birth of the son has deprived the old man of his power. The first\nattack of the death serpent in the form of the son, Siegmund, Wotan has\nrepelled; he has broken Siegmund’s sword, but Siegmund rises again in a\ngrandson. This inevitable fate is always helped by the woman; hence the\nwrath of Wotan.\n\nAt Siegfried’s birth Sieglinde dies, as is proper. The\nfoster-mother[700] is apparently not a woman, but a chthonic god, a\ncrippled dwarf, who belongs to that tribe which renounces love.[701] The\nEgyptian god of the underworld, the crippled shadow of Osiris (who\ncelebrated a melancholy resurrection in the sexless semi-ape\nHarpocrates), is the tutor of Horus, who has to avenge the death of his\nfather.\n\nMeanwhile Brunhilde sleeps the enchanted sleep, like a Hierosgamos, upon\na mountain, where Wotan has put her to sleep[702] with the magic thorn\n(Edda), surrounded by the flames of Wotan’s fire (equal to libido[703]),\nwhich wards off every one. But Mime becomes Siegfried’s enemy and wills\nhis death through Fafner. Here Mime’s dynamic nature is revealed; he is\na masculine representation of the terrible mother, also a foster-mother\nof demoniac nature, who places the poisonous worm (Typhon) in her son’s\n(Horus’s) path. Siegfried’s longing for the mother drives him away from\nMime, and his travels begin with the mother of death, and lead through\nvanquishing the “terrible mother”[704] to the woman:\n\n               _Siegfried_:\n\n                 Off with the imp!\n                 I ne’er would see him more!\n                 Might I but know what my mother was like\n                 That will my thought never tell me!\n                 Her eyes’ tender light\n                 Surely did shine\n                 Like the soft eyes of the doe!\n\nSiegfried decides to separate from the demon which was the mother in the\npast, and he gropes forward with the longing directed towards the\nmother. Nature acquires a hidden maternal significance for him (“doe”);\nin the tones of nature he discovers a suggestion of the maternal voice\nand the maternal language:\n\n                _Siegfried_:\n\n                Thou gracious birdling,\n                Strange art thou to me!\n                Dost thou in the wood here dwell?\n                Ah, would that I could take thy meaning!\n                Thy song something would say—\n                Perchance—of my loving mother!",
