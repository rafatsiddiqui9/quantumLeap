    "paragraph": "Let us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom of boring. Let us imagine a strong adult man carrying on the boring with two pieces of wood with the same perseverance and the energy corresponding to that of this child. He may very easily create fire by this play. But of greatest significance in this work is the rhythm.[307] This hypothesis seems to me psychologically possible, although it should not be said with this that only in this way could the discovery of fire occur. It can result just as well by the striking together of flints. It is scarcely possible that fire was created in only one way. All I want to establish here is merely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications of which point to the possibility that in such a way was fire invented or prepared.",

    "question": "How might the rhythmic action of rubbing two pieces of wood together contribute to the discovery of fire?",
    "answer": "The rhythmic action of rubbing two pieces of wood together generates friction, which can produce enough heat to ignite materials and potentially create fire. This method highlights the psychological process where repetitive motions can lead to important discoveries.",
