    "paragraph": "The third song presents the previous history of Hiawatha\u2019s mother. His grandmother, when a maiden, lived in the moon. There she once swung upon a liana, but a jealous lover cut off the liana, and Nokomis, Hiawatha\u2019s grandmother, fell to earth. The people, who saw her fall downwards, thought that she was a _shooting star_. This marvellous descent of Nokomis is more plainly illustrated by a later passage of this same song; there little Hiawatha asks the grandmother what is the moon. Nokomis teaches him about it as follows: The moon is the body of a _grandmother_, whom a warlike grandson has cast up there in wrath. Hence the moon is the _grandmother_. In ancient beliefs, the moon is also the gathering place of departed souls,[636] the guardian of seeds; therefore, once more a place of the origin of life of predominantly feminine significance. The remarkable thing is that Nokomis, falling upon the earth, gave birth to a daughter, Wenonah, subsequently the mother of Hiawatha. The throwing upwards of the mother, and her falling down and bringing forth, seems to contain something typical in itself. Thus a story of the seventeenth century relates that a mad bull threw a pregnant woman as high as a house, and tore open her womb, and the child fell without harm upon the earth. On account of his wonderful birth, this child was considered a hero or doer of miracles, but he died at an early age. The belief is widespread among lower savages that the sun is feminine and the moon masculine. Among the Namaqua, a Hottentot tribe, the opinion is prevalent that the sun consists of transparent bacon.\u201cThe people, who journey on boats, draw it down by magic every  evening, cut off a suitable piece and then give it _a kick so that it  flies up again into the sky_.\u201d\u2014_Waitz_: \u201cAnthropologie,\u201d II, 342.",

    "question": "What is the significance of Nokomis' fall and the birth of Wenonah in the context of the story?",
    "answer": "The fall of Nokomis and her subsequent birth of Wenonah holds a significant place in the story, as it is a symbol of the connection between the celestial realm and the earthly one, and it sets the stage for the birth of Hiawatha.",
