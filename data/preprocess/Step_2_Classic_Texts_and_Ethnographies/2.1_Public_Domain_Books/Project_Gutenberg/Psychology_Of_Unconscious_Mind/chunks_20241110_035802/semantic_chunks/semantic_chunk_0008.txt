Criticisms and Controversies

There are several criticisms and controversies surrounding the Oedipus problem.

Some scholars have argued that the play is misogynistic, with the character of Jocasta being portrayed as a passive and weak figure.

Others have criticized the play for its treatment of Oedipus, who is ultimately punished for his actions without any sense of justice or accountability.
