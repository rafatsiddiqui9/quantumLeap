I know the objection which every one unacquainted with psychoanalysis will raise, viz., that Miss Miller might just as well have chosen any other verse as an example, and that, accidentally, she had taken the first one that happened to appear which had this content, also accidentally. As is well known, the criticism which we hear equally from our medical colleagues, and from our patients, is generally based on such arguments. This misunderstanding arises from the fact that the law of causation in the psychical sphere is not taken seriously enough; that is to say, there are no accidents, no \u201cjust as wells.\u201d It is so, and there is, therefore, a sufficient reason at hand why it is so. It is moreover true that Miss Miller\u2019s poem is connected with the fall, wherein just that erotic component comes forth, the existence of which we have surmised above.",
