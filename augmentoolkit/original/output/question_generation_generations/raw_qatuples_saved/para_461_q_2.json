    "paragraph": "\u201cI indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh  after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he  shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\u201dWith Vollers we may also compare Chidher and Elias (Moses and his servant Joshua) with Gilgamesh and his brother Eabani. Gilgamesh wandered through the world, driven by anxiety and longing, to find immortality. His path led him across the seas to the wise Utnapishtim (Noah), who knew how to cross the waters of death. There Gilgamesh had to dive down to the bottom of the sea for the magical herb which was to lead him back to the land of men. When he had come again to his native land a serpent stole the magic plant from him (the fish again slid into the sea). But on the return from the land of the blessed an immortal mariner accompanied him, who, banished by a curse of Utnapishtim, was forbidden to return to the land of the blessed. Gilgamesh\u2019s journey had lost its purpose on account of the loss of the magic herb; instead he is accompanied by an immortal, whose fate, indeed, we cannot learn from the fragments of the epic. This banished immortal is the model for Ahasver, as Jensen[395] aptly remarked.Again we encounter the motive of the Dioscuri, mortal and immortal, setting and rising sun. This _motive is also represented as if projected from the hero_.\u201cH\u00e6 autem \u00e6tatum diversitates ad solem referuntur, ut parvulus  videatur hiemali solstitio, qualem Aegyptii proferunt ex adyto die  certa, ... \u00e6quinoctio vernali figura iuvenis ornatur. Postea statuitur  \u00e6tas ejus plenissima effigie barb\u00e6 solstitio \u00e6stivo ... exunde per  diminutiones veluti senescenti quarta forma deus figuratur.\u201d[401][402]",

    "question": "How is the theme of mortal and immortal characters, or the Dioscuri, represented in the text?",
    "answer": "The text represents the theme of mortal and immortal characters through the idea of setting and rising sun, symbolizing the contrast between these two states. This concept is portrayed as if it originates from the hero, illustrating the dual nature of human existence and the pursuit of eternal life.",
