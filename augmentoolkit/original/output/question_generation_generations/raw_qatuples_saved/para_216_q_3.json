    "paragraph": "The neurotic who cannot leave the mother has good reasons; the fear of death holds him there. It seems as if no idea and no word were strong enough to express the meaning of this. Entire religions were constructed in order to give words to the immensity of this conflict. This struggle for expression which continued down through the centuries certainly cannot have its source in the restricted realm of the vulgar conception of incest. Rather one must understand the law which is ultimately expressed as \u201cIncest prohibition\u201d as coercion to domestication, and consider the religious systems as institutions which first receive, then organize and gradually sublimate, the motor forces of the animal nature not immediately available for cultural purposes.",

    "question": "How might one interpret the role of religious institutions in relation to cultural and behavioral norms?",
    "answer": "Religious institutions play a role in receiving and organizing the raw, instinctual forces of human nature that are not immediately useful for cultural purposes. They then gradually sublimate these forces, transforming them into culturally acceptable norms and behaviors. This process helps to domesticate the individual and align their instincts with societal expectations.",
