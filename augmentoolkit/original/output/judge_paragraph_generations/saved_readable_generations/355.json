{"paragraph": "\u201cAfter Ti\u00e2mat had powerfully done her work   She conceived evil against the gods, her descendants;   In order to revenge Apsu, Ti\u00e2mat did evil.   When Ea now heard this thing   He became painfully anxious, sorrowfully he sat himself.   He went to the father, his creator, Ans\u0306ar,   To relate to him all that Ti\u00e2mat plotted.   Ti\u00e2mat, our mother, has taken an aversion to us,   Has prepared a riotous mob, furiously raging.\u201dThe gods finally opposed Marduk, the god of spring, the victorious sun, against the fearful host of Ti\u00e2mat. Marduk prepared for battle. Of his chief weapon, which he created, it is said:\u201cHe created the evil wind, Im\u1e2bullu, the south storm and the hurricane, The fourth wind, the seventh wind, the whirlwind and the harmful wind, Then let he loose the winds, which he had created, the seven: To cause confusion within Ti\u00e2mat, they followed behind him, Then the lord took up the cyclone, his great weapon; For his chariot he mounted the stormwind, the incomparable, the terrible   one.\u201dHis chief weapon is the wind and a net, with which he will entangle Ti\u00e2mat. He approaches Ti\u00e2mat and challenges her to a combat.\u201cThen Ti\u00e2mat and Marduk, the wise one of the gods, came together,  Rising for the fight, approaching to the battle:  Then the lord spread out his net and caught her.  He let loose the Im\u1e2bullu in his train at her face,  Then Ti\u00e2mat now opened her mouth as wide as she could.  He let the Im\u1e2bullu rush in so that her lips could not close;  With the raging winds he filled her womb.  Her inward parts were seized and she opened wide her mouth.  He touched her with the spear, dismembered her body,  He slashed her inward parts, and cut out her heart,  Subdued her and put an end to her life.  He threw down her body and stepped upon it.\u201dAfter Marduk slew the mother, he devised the creation of the world.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
