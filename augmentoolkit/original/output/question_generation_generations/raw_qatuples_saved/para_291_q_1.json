    "paragraph": "\u201cIt is perhaps interesting to recall that Anaxagoras also had the  Cosmos arise out of chaos through a sort of whirlwind, which does not  happen usually without producing sound.[67] But at this time I had  studied no philosophy, and knew nothing either of Anaxagoras or of his  theories about the \u2018\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2,\u2019 which I, unconsciously, was openly  following. At that time, also, I was equally in complete ignorance of  Leibnitz, and, therefore, knew nothing of his doctrine \u2018dum Deus  calculat, fit mundus.\u2019\u201dMiss Miller\u2019s references to Anaxagoras and to Leibnitz both refer to creation by means of thought; that is to say, that divine thought alone could bring forth a new material reality, a reference at first not intelligible, but which will soon, however, be more easily understood.We now come to those fancies from which Miss Miller principally drew her unconscious creation.\u201cIn the first place, there is the \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019 by Milton, which we  had at home in the edition illustrated by Dor\u00e9, and which had often  delighted me from childhood. Then the \u2018Book of Job,\u2019 which had been  read aloud to me since the time of my earliest recollection. Moreover,  if one compares the first words of \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019 with my first  verse, one notices that there is the same verse measure.\u201c\u2018Of man\u2019s first disobedience ...\u201c\u2018When the Eternal first made sound.\u2019\u201cMy poem also recalls various passages in Job, and one or two places  in Handel\u2019s Oratorio \u2018The Creation,\u2019 which came out very indistinctly  in the first part of the dream.\u201d[68]The \u201cLost Paradise\u201d which, as is well known, is so closely connected with the beginning of the world, is made more clearly evident by the verse\u2014\u201cOf man\u2019s first disobedience\u201d",

    "question": "How does the author's poem draw inspiration from \"Paradise Lost\" and the Book of Job?",
    "answer": "The author's poem draws inspiration from \"Paradise Lost\" by John Milton, particularly noting the verse measure in the opening line: \"Of man\u2019s first disobedience...\" and the phrase \"When the Eternal first made sound.\" Additionally, the poem recalls various passages from the Book of Job and Handel's Oratorio \"The Creation,\" which are evident through the allusions in the dream.",
