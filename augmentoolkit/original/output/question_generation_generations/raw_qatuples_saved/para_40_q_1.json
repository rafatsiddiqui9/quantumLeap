    "paragraph": "\u201c_It is, therefore, a moral duty for the man of science to expose himself to the risk of committing error and to submit to criticism, in order that science may continue to progress. A writer has attacked the author for this very severely, saying, here is a scientific ideal very limited and very paltry. But those who are endowed with a mind sufficiently serious and impersonal as not to believe that all that they write is the expression of truth absolute and eternal, approve of this theory which places the aims of science well above the miserable vanity and paltry \u2018amour propre\u2019 of the scientist._\u201d\u2014GUGLIELMO FERRERO._Les Lois Psychologiques du Symbolisme\u20141895.

    "question": "How does the author view the criticism faced by a scientist who adheres to this moral duty?",
    "answer": "The author acknowledges that some critics see the scientist's willingness to be critiqued as a \"scientific ideal very limited and very paltry.\" However, the author supports this practice, noting that those with a serious and impersonal mindset do not believe all their work is an absolute and eternal truth. They approve of the theory that places the aims of science above the personal vanity of the scientist.",
