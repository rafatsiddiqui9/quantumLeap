    us to speak of the symbolism of Popocatepetl as belonging to the creating part
    of the human body, so at the end does the Miller drama again give us an opportunity
    of seeing how the volcano assists in the death of the hero and causes him to disappear
    by means of an earthquake into the depths of the earth. As the volcano gave birth
    and name to the hero, so at the end of the day it devours him again.[854] We learn
    from the last words of the hero that _his longed-for beloved_, she who alone understands
    him, is called Ja-ni-wa-ma. We find in this name those lisped syllables familiar
    to us from the early childhood of the hero, Hiawatha, Wawa, wama, mama. The only
    one who really understands us is the mother. For _verstehen_, “to understand”
    (Old High German _firstân_), is probably derived from a primitive Germanic prefix
    _fri_, identical with περὶ, meaning “roundabout.” The Old High German _antfristôn_,
    “to interpret,” is considered as identical with _firstân_. From that results a
    fundamental significance of the verb _verstehen_, “to understand,” as “standing
    round about something.”[855] _Comprehendere_ and κατασυλλαμβάνειν express a similar
    idea as the German _erfassen_, “to grasp, to comprehend.” The thing common to
    these expressions is the surrounding, the enfolding. And there is no doubt that
    there is nothing in the world which so completely enfolds us as the mother. When
    the neurotic complains that the world has no understanding, he says indirectly
