{"paragraph": "If now we wish to know who is the unknown servant of God, we are told in this passage _he is Dhulqarnein, Alexander, the Sun; he goes to the place of setting and he goes to the place of rising_. The passage about the unknown servant of God is explained by the commentaries in a well-defined legend. The servant is Chidher, \u201cthe verdant one,\u201d the never-tiring wanderer, who roams for hundreds and thousands of years over lands and seas, the teacher and counsellor of pious men; the one wise in divine knowledge\u2014the immortal.[371] The authority of the Tabari associates Chidher with Dhulqarnein; Chidher is said to have reached the \u201cstream of life\u201d as a follower of Alexander, and both unwittingly had drunk of it, so that they became immortal. Moreover, _Chidher is identified by the old commentators with Elias_, who also did not die, but _who was taken to Heaven in a fiery chariot_. Elias is _Helios_.[372] It is to be observed that Ahasver also owes his existence to an obscure place in the holy Christian scriptures. This place is to be found in Matthew xvi:28. First comes the scene where Christ appoints Peter as the rock of his church, and nominates him the governor of his power.[373] After that follows the prophecy of his death, and then comes the passage:\u201cVerily, I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not  taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\u201dHere follows the scene of the transfiguration:\u201cAnd was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,  and his raiment was white as the light.\u201cAnd behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.\u201cThen answered Peter and said unto Jesus, \u2018Lord, it is good for us to  be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for  thee and one for Moses and one for Elias.\u2019\u201d[374]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
