Symbolism and Themes

The Oedipus problem is rich in symbolism and themes, making it a complex and thought-provoking work of literature.

One of the most significant themes is the concept of fate versus free will. Oedipus's actions are determined by a prophecy, but he also makes choices that ultimately lead to his downfall.

Another theme is the idea of identity and self-discovery. Oedipus's journey is one of self-discovery, as he uncovers the truth about his past and his place in the world.
