    "paragraph": "That points undoubtedly to a ritual marriage, which was celebrated subterraneously in mother earth. The Priestess of Demeter seems to be the representative of the earth goddess, perhaps the furrow of the field.[666] The descent into the earth is also the symbol of the mother\u2019s womb, and was a widespread conception under the form of cave worship. Plutarch relates of the Magi that they sacrificed to Ahriman, \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd.[667] Lukian lets the magician Mithrobarzanes \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u1f14\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f51\u03bb\u1ff6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd,[668] descend into the bowels of the earth. According to the testimony of Moses of the Koran, the sister Fire and the brother Spring were worshipped in Armenia in a cave. Julian gave an account from the Attis legend of a \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd,[669] from whence Cybele brings up her son lover, that is to say, gives birth to him.[670] The cave of Christ\u2019s birth, in Bethlehem (\u2018House of Bread\u2019), is said to have been an Attis spel\u00e6um.A further Eleusinian symbolism is found in the festival of Hierosgamos, in the form of the _mystic chests_, which, according to the testimony of Clemens of Alexandria, may have contained pastry, salt and fruits. The synthema (confession) of the mystic transmitted by Clemens is suggestive in still other directions:\u201cI have fasted, I have drunk of the barleydrink, I have taken from the  chest and after I have labored, I have placed it back in the basket,  and from the basket into the chest.\u201d",

    "question": "What is the significance of the \"mystic chests\" in the Eleusinian mysteries, and what do they contain according to the text?",
    "answer": "The \"mystic chests\" in the Eleusinian mysteries are significant as they represent the symbolic vessels used in the initiation rituals. According to the text, Clemens of Alexandria mentions that these chests may contain pastry, salt, and fruits. The use of these symbols is part of the initiation process, which is meant to convey deep truths about the divine union and the cycle of life. The act of taking from the chest and returning it, as described in the synthema (confession), symbolizes the participant's journey and transformation through the mysteries.",
