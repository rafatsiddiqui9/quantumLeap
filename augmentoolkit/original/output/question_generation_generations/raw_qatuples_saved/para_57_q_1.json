    "paragraph": "Up to the present time the psychoanalytic investigator has turned his interest chiefly to the analysis of the individual psychologic problems. It seems to me, however, that in the present state of affairs there is a more or less imperative demand for the psychoanalyst to broaden the analysis of the individual problems by a comparative study of historical material relating to them, just as Freud has already done in a masterly manner in his book on \u201cLeonardo da Vinci.\u201d[12] For, just as the psychoanalytic conceptions promote understanding of the historic psychologic creations, so reversedly historical materials can shed new light upon individual psychologic problems. These and similar considerations have caused me to turn my attention somewhat more to the historical, in the hope that, out of this, new insight into the foundations of individual psychology might be won.CHAPTER I          CONCERNING THE TWO KINDS OF THINKING",

    "question": "How does the author propose that historical materials can contribute to the field of psychoanalysis?",
    "answer": "The author proposes that historical materials can contribute to the field of psychoanalysis by providing new insights and shedding light on individual psychological problems. This is because the concepts and methods of psychoanalysis can enhance the understanding of historical psychological phenomena, and conversely, historical data can offer fresh perspectives and deeper understanding of individual psychological issues.",
