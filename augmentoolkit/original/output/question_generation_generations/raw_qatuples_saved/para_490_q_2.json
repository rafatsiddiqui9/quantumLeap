    "paragraph": "We come across a similar symbolism in the myth of Ogyges, the mythical king who rules in Egyptian Thebes and whose wife was appropriately named Thebe. The B\u0153otian Thebes founded by Cadmus received on that account a surname, \u201cOgygian.\u201d This surname was also given to the great flood, as it was called \u201cOgygian\u201d because it occurred under Ogyges. This coincidence will be found later on to be hardly accidental. The fact that the city and the wife of Ogyges bear the same name indicates that somewhere a relation must exist between the city and the woman, which is not difficult to understand, for the city is identical with the woman. We meet a similar idea in Hindoo lore where Indra appears as the husband of Urvara, but Urvara means \u201cthe fertile land.\u201d In a similar way the occupancy of a country by the king was understood as marriage with the ploughed land. Similar representations must have prevailed in Europe as well. Princes had to guarantee, for example, a good harvest at their accession. The Swedish King Domaldi was actually killed on account of the failure of the harvest (Ynglinga s\u00e2ga 18). In the Rama s\u00e2ga the hero Rama marries S\u00eet\u00e2, the furrow of the field.[424] To the same group of ideas belongs the Chinese custom of the Emperor ploughing a furrow at his ascension to the throne. This idea of the soil being feminine also embraces the idea of continual companionship with the woman, a physical communication. Shiva, the Phallic God, is, like Mahadeva and Parwati, male and female. He has even given one-half of his body to his consort Parwati as a dwelling place.[425] Inman[426] gives us a drawing of a Pundite of Ardanari-Iswara; one-half of the god is masculine, the other half feminine, and the genitals are in continuous cohabitation. The motive of continuous cohabitation is expressed in a well-known lingam symbol, which is to be found everywhere in Indian temples; the base is a ",

    "answer": "Myths and cultural practices across different parts of the world reflect the idea that the soil is feminine and represents a continuous companion or physical communication through various representations. For example, in India, the Phallic God Shiva is depicted as both male and female, with one half of his body given to his consort Parvati as a dwelling place, symbolizing constant physical communication. In another example, the Chinese custom involves the Emperor ploughing a furrow at his ascension to the throne, symbolizing a physical and continuous connection with the land.",
