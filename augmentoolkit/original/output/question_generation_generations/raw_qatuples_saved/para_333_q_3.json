    "paragraph": "The reader will regret with me that we cannot know the reason for her cares and anxieties. It would have been of great importance for what follows to have information on this point. This gap in our knowledge is the more to be deplored because, between the first poem in 1898 and the time of the phantasy here discussed (1902), four whole years have passed. All information is lacking regarding this period, during which the great problem surely survived in the unconscious. Perhaps this lack has its advantages in that our interest is not diverted from the universal applicability of the phantasy here produced by sympathy in regard to the personal fate of the author. Therefore, something is obviated which often prevents the analyst in his daily task from looking away from the tedious toil of detail to that wider relation which reveals each neurotic conflict to be involved with human fate as a whole.\u201cOf all passions, that which is least known to ourselves is indolence:  it is the most ardent and malignant of them all, although its violence  may be insensible, and the injuries it causes may be hidden; if we  will consider its power attentively, we will see that it makes itself,  upon all occasions, mistress of our sentiments, of our interests, and  of our pleasures; it is the anchor, which has the power to arrest the  largest vessels; it is a calm more dangerous to the most important  affairs than rocks and the worst tempest. The repose of indolence is a  secret charm of the soul which suddenly stops the most ardent pursuits  and the firmest resolutions; finally to give the true idea of this  passion, one must say that indolence is like a beatitude of the soul  which consoles it for all its losses and takes the place of all its  possessions.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the author describe the impact of indolence on the soul?",
    "answer": "The author describes indolence as a \"secret charm of the soul\" that stops the most ardent pursuits and the firmest resolutions. It is like a beatitude of the soul that consoles it for its losses and takes the place of its possessions. It has the power to arrest even the largest vessels of effort and can be more dangerous in its calmness than rocks and the worst tempest in matters of the soul.",
