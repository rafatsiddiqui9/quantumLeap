    "paragraph": "These three comparisons with a woman are to be found near each other on the same page. Mudjekeewis has, like a true hero, once more torn life from the jaws of death, from the all-devouring \u201cterrible mother.\u201d This deed, which, as we have seen, is also represented as a journey to hell, \u201cnight journey through the sea,\u201d the conquering of the monster from within, signifies at the same time entrance into the mother\u2019s womb, a rebirth, the results of which are perceptible also for Mudjekeewis. As in the Zosimos vision, here too the entering one becomes the breath of the wind or spirit. Mudjekeewis becomes the west wind, the fertilizing breath, the father of winds.[634] His sons become the other winds. An intermezzo tells of them and of their love stories, of which I will mention only the courtship of Wabuns, the East Wind, because here the erotic wooing of the wind is pictured in an especially beautiful manner. Every morning he sees a beautiful girl in a meadow, whom he eagerly courts:\u201cEvery morning, gazing earthward,         Still the first thing he beheld there         Was her blue eyes looking at him,         Two blue lakes among the rushes.\u201dThe comparison with water is not a matter of secondary importance, because \u201cfrom wind and water\u201d shall man be born anew.\u201cAnd he wooed her with caresses,         Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,         With his flattering words he wooed her,         With his sighing and his singing,         Gentlest whispers in the branches,         Softest music, sweetest odors,\u201d etc.In these onomatopoetic verses the wind\u2019s caressing courtship is excellently expressed.[635]",
