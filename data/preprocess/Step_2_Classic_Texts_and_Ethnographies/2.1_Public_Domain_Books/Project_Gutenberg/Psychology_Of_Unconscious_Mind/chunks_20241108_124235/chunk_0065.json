And if with that the bond between mother and daughter is\nsevered, a great step forward is gained both for inner and outer\nfreedom. But man wishes to remain a child too long; he would fain stop\nthe turning of the wheel, which, rolling, bears along with it the years;\nman wishes to keep his childhood and eternal youth, rather than to die\nand suffer corruption in the grave. (“O, do not suffer my body to fall\ninto decay and corruption.”) Nothing brings the relentless flight of\ntime and the cruel perishability of all blossoms more painfully to our\nconsciousness than an inactive and empty life. _Idle dreaming is the\nmother of the fear of death_, the sentimental deploring of what has been\nand the vain turning back of the clock. Although man can forget in the\nlong- (perhaps too long) guarded feelings of youth, in the dreamy state\nof stubbornly held remembrances, that the wheel rolls onward,\nnevertheless mercilessly does the gray hair, the relaxation of the skin\nand the wrinkles in the face tell us, that whether or not we expose the\nbody to the destroying powers of the whole struggle of life, the poison\nof the stealthily creeping serpent of time consumes our bodies, which,\nalas! we so dearly love. Nor does it help if we cry out with the\nmelancholy hero Chiwantopel, “I have kept my body inviolate”; flight\nfrom life does not free us from the law of age and death. The neurotic\nwho seeks to get rid of the necessities of life wins nothing and lays\nupon himself the frightful burden of a premature age and death, which\nmust appear especially cruel on account of the total emptiness and\nmeaninglessness of his life. If the libido is not permitted to follow\nthe progressive life, which is willing to accept all dangers and all\nlosses, then it follows the other road, sinking into its own depths,\nworking down into the old foreboding regarding the immortality of all\nlife, to the longing for rebirth.\n\nHölderlin exemplifies this path in his poetry and his life. I leave the\npoet to speak in his song:\n\n                             _To the Rose._\n\n                 “In the Mother-womb eternal,\n                   Sweetest queen of every lea,\n                 Still the living and supernal\n                   Nature carries thee and me.\n\n                 “Little rose, the storm’s fierce power\n                   Strips our leaves and alters us;\n                 Yet the deathless germ will tower\n                   To new blooms, miraculous.”\n\nThe following comments may be made upon the parable of this poem: The\nrose is the symbol of the beloved woman (“Haidenröslein,” heather rose\nof Goethe). The rose blooms in the “rose-garden” of the maiden;\ntherefore, it is also a direct symbol of the libido. When the poet\ndreams that he is with the rose in the mother-womb of nature, then,\npsychologically, the fact is that his libido is with the mother. Here is\nan eternal germination and renewal. We have come across this motive\nalready in the Hierosgamos hymn (Iliad XIV): The nuptials in the blessed\nWest; that is to say, the union in and with the mother. Plutarch shows\nus this motive in naïve form in his tradition of the Osiris myth; Osiris\nand Isis copulating in the mother’s womb. This is also perceived by\nHölderlin as the enviable prerogative of the gods—to enjoy everlasting\ninfancy. Thus, in Hyperion, he says:\n\n                 “Fateless, like the sleeping nursling,\n                 Breathe the Heavenly ones;\n                 Chastely guarded in modest buds,\n                 Their spirits blossom eternally,\n                 And their quiet eyes\n                 Gaze out in placid\n                 Eternal serenity.”\n\nThis quotation shows the meaning of heavenly bliss. Hölderlin never was\nable to forget this first and greatest happiness, the dreamy picture of\nwhich estranged him from real life. Moreover, in this poem, the ancient\n_motive of the twins_ in the mother’s womb is intimated. (Isis and\nOsiris in the mother’s womb.) The motive is archaic. There is a legend\nin Frobenius of how the great serpent (appearing from the little serpent\nin the hollow tree, through the so-called stretching out of the serpent)\nhas finally devoured all men (devouring mother—death), and only a\npregnant woman remains alive; she digs a ditch, covers it with a stone\n(grave—mother’s womb), and, living there, she gives birth to twins, the\nsubsequent dragon-killers (the hero in double form, man and phallus, man\nand woman, man with his libido, the dying and rising sun).\n\nThis existence together in the mother is to be found also very\nbeautifully expressed in an African myth (Frobenius):\n\n  “In the beginning, Obatala, the heaven, and Odudua, the earth, his\n  wife, lay pressed firmly together in a calabas.”\n\nThe guarding “in a modest bud” is an idea which has appeared already in\nPlutarch, where it is said that the sun was born in the morning from a\nflower bud. Brahma, too, comes from the bud, which also gave birth in\nAssam to the first human pair.\n\n                          _Humanity._\n\n                        (An unfinished poem.)\n\n  “Scarcely sprouted from the waters, O Earth,\n  Are thy old mountain tops and diffuse odors,\n  While the first green islands, full of young woods, breathe delight\n  Through the May air over the Ocean.\n\n  “And joyfully the eye of the Sun-god looked down\n  Upon the firstlings of the trees and flowers;\n  Laughing children of his youth, born from thee;\n  When on the fairest of the islands....\n\n         ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n  Once lay thy most beautiful child under the grapes;\n  Lay after a mild night; in the dawn,\n  In the daybreak a child born to thee, O Earth!\n  And the boy looks up familiarly\n  To his Father, Helios,\n  And, tasting the sweet grapes,\n  He picked the sacred vine for his nurse,\n  And soon he is grown; the beasts\n  Fear him, for he is different from them:\n  This man; he is not like thee, the father,\n  For the lofty soul of the father,\n  Is in him boldly united with thy pleasures,\n  And thy sadness, O Earth,\n  He may resemble the eternal Nature,\n  The mother of Gods, the terrible Mother.\n\n  “Ah! therefore, O Earth,\n  His presumption drives him away from thy breast,\n  And thy gifts are vain, the tender ones;\n  Ever and ever too high does the proud heart beat.\n\n  “Out from the sweet meadow of his shores\n  Man must go into the flowerless waters,\n  And tho his groves shine with golden fruit,\n  Like the starry night, yet he digs,\n  He digs caves in the mountains, and seeks in the mines,\n  Far from the sacred rays of his father,\n  Faithless also to the Sun-god,\n  Who does not love weaklings, and mocks at cares.\n\n  “Ah! freer do the birds of the wood breathe:\n  Although the breast of man heaves wilder and more proudly,\n  His pride becomes fear, and the tender flowers\n  Of his peace do not bloom for long.”\n\nThis poem betrays to us the beginning of the discord between the poet\nand nature; he begins to be estranged from reality, the natural actual\nexistence. It is a remarkable idea how the little child chooses “the\nvine for his nurse.” This Dionysian allusion is very old. In the\nsignificant blessing of Jacob it is said of Judah (Genesis, chap. xlix,\nverse 11):\n\n  “Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice\n  vine.”\n\nA Gnostic gem has been preserved upon which there is a representation of\nan ass suckling her foal, above which is the symbol of Cancer, and the\ncircumscription D.N.I.H.Y.X.P.S.: Dominus Noster Jesus Christus, with\nthe supplement Dei filius. As Justinus Martyr indignantly observes, the\nconnections of the Christian legend with that of Dionysus are\nunmistakable. (Compare, for example, the miracle of the wine.) In the\nlast-named legend the ass plays an important rôle. Generally speaking,\nthe ass has an entirely different meaning in the Mediterranean countries\nthan with us—an economic one. Therefore, it is a benediction when Jacob\nsays (Genesis, chap. xlix, verse 14):\n\n  “Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens.”\n\nThe above-mentioned thought is altogether Oriental. Just as in Egypt the\nnew-born sun is a bull-calf, in the rest of the Orient it can easily be\nan ass’s foal, to whom the vine is the nurse. Hence the picture in the\nblessing of Jacob, where it is said of Judah:\n\n  “His eyes are ruddy with wine and his teeth white with milk.”\n\nThe mock crucifix of the Palatine, with an ass’s head, evidently alludes\nto a very significant background.\n\n                         _To Nature._\n\n         “While about thy veil I lingered, playing,\n           And, like any bud, upon thee hung,[790]\n         Still I felt thy heart in every straying\n           Sound about my heart that shook and clung.\n         While I groped with faith and painful yearning,\n           To your picture, glowing and unfurled,\n         Still I found a place for all my burning\n           Tears, and for my love I found a world!\n\n         “To the Sun my heart, before all others,\n           Turned and felt its potent magicry;\n         And it called the stars its little brothers,[791]\n           And it called the Spring, God’s melody;\n         And each breeze in groves or woodlands fruity\n           Held thy spirit—and that same sweet joy\n         Moved the well-springs of my heart with beauty—\n           Those were golden days without alloy.\n\n         “Where the Spring is cool in every valley,[792]\n           And the youngest bush and twig is green,\n         And about the rocks the grasses rally,\n           And the branches show the sky between,\n         There I lay, imbibing every flower\n           In a rapt, intoxicated glee,\n         And, surrounded by a golden shower,\n           From their heights the clouds sank down to me.[793]\n\n         “Often, as a weary, wandering river\n           Longs to join the ocean’s placid mirth,\n         I have wept and lost myself forever\n           In the fulness of thy love, O Earth!\n         Then—with all the ardor of my being—\n           Forth I rushed from Time’s slow apathy,\n         Like a pilgrim home from travel, fleeing\n           To the arms of rapt Eternity.\n\n         “_Blessed be childhood’s golden dreams, their power\n           Hid from me Life’s dismal poverty_:\n         _All the heart’s rich germs ye brought to flower;\n           Things I could not reach, ye gave to me!_[794]\n         In thy beauty and thy light, O Nature,\n           Free from care and from compulsion free,\n         Fruitful Love attained a kingly stature,\n           Rich as harvests reaped in Arcady.\n\n         “That which brought me up, is dead and riven,\n           Dead the youthful world which was my shield;\n         And this breast, which used to harbor heaven,\n           Dead and dry as any stubble-field.\n         Still my Springlike sorrows sing and cover\n           With their friendly comfort every smart—\n         But the morning of my life is over\n           And the Spring has faded from my heart....\n\n         “Shadows are the things that once we cherished;\n           Love itself must fade and cannot bide;\n         Since the golden dreams of youth have perished,\n           Even friendly Nature’s self has died.\n         Heart, poor heart, those days could never show it—\n           How far-off thy home, and where it lies ...\n         Now, alas, thou nevermore wilt know it\n           If a dream of it does not suffice.”\n\n                            _Palinodia._\n\n    “What gathers about me, Earth, in your dusky, friendly green?\n    What are you blowing towards me, Winds, what do you bring again?\n    There is a rustling in all the tree-tops....\n\n           ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n    “Why do you wake my soul?\n    Why do ye stir in me the past, ye Kind ones?\n    Oh, spare me, and let them rest; oh, do not mock\n    Those ashes of my joy....\n\n    “O change your changeless gods—\n    And grow in your youth over the old ones.\n    And if you would be akin to the mortals\n    The young girls will blossom for you.\n    And the young heroes will shine;\n    And, sweeter than ever,\n    Morning will play upon the cheeks of the happy ones;\n    And, ravishing-sweet, you will hear\n    The songs of those who are without care....\n\n    “Ah, once the living waves of song\n    Surged out of every bush to me;\n    And still the heavenly ones glanced down upon me,\n    Their eyes shining with joy.”\n\n           ·       ·       ·       ·       ·",
