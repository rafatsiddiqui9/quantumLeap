    "THE OEDIPUS PROBLEM\n</START_SECTION>\n\n<START_SECTION>\nThe Oedipus problem is a classic tale in ancient Greek literature, written by the famous playwright Sophocles. It is a tragedy that revolves around the life of Oedipus, a king of Thebes. The story begins with the prophecy that Oedipus will kill his father and marry his mother, which he ultimately fulfills. However, the problem is not just about Oedipus' personal fate, but also about the fate of his family and the city of Thebes.\n</START_SECTION>\n\n<START_SECTION>\nThe story starts with the arrival of a stranger in Thebes, who claims to have knowledge of the city's past. The stranger reveals that the city is cursed and that the only way to lift the curse is for the murderer of Laius, the former king, to be found and punished. Oedipus, determined to solve the mystery, sets out to find the killer.\n</START_SECTION>\n\n<START_SECTION>\nAs Oedipus searches for the killer, he encounters various characters, including the blind prophet Tiresias, who reveals to him that he himself is the one who killed Laius.
