    "paragraph": "The motive of encoiling is mother symbolism.[496] This is verified by the fact that the trees, for example, bring forth again (like the whale in the legend of Jonah). They do that very generally, thus in the Greek legend the \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9[497] of the ash trees are the mothers of the race of men of the Iron Age. In northern mythology, Askr, the ash tree, is the primitive father. His wife, Embla, is the \u201cEmsige,\u201d the active one, and not, as was earlier believed, the aspen. _Askr_ probably means, in the first place, the phallic spear of the ash tree. (Compare the Sabine custom of parting the bride\u2019s hair with the lance.) The Bundehesh symbolizes the first people, Meschia and Meschiane, as the tree Reivas, one part of which places a branch in a hole of the other part. The material which, according to the northern myth, was animated by the god when he created men[498] is designated as _tr\u00ea_ = wood, tree.[499] I recall also \u1f55\u03bb\u03b7 = wood, which in Latin is called _materia_. In the wood of the \u201cworld-ash,\u201d Ygdrasil, a human pair hid themselves at the end of the world, from whom sprang the race of the renewed world.[500] The Noah motive is easily recognized in this conception (the night journey on the sea); at the same time, in the symbol of Ygdrasil, a mother idea is again apparent. At the moment of the destruction of the world the \u201cworld-ash\u201d becomes the guardian mother, the tree of death and life, one \u201c\u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd.\u201d[501][502] This function of rebirth of the \u201cworld-ash\u201d also helps to elucidate the representation met with in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which is called \u201cthe gate of knowledge of the soul of the East\u201d:\u201cI am the pilot in the holy keel, I am the steersman who allows no  rest in the ship of R\u00e2.[503] I know that tree of emerald green from  whose midst R\u00e2 rises to the height of the clouds.\u201d[504]",

    "question": "How does the Bundehesh represent the creation of the first people, and what does this suggest about the role of wood and trees?",
    "answer": "The Bundehesh symbolizes the first people, Meschia and Meschiane, as the tree Reivas, one part of which places a branch in a hole of the other part. This suggests that wood and trees are central to the concept of creation and the animated material by which the god created the first humans.",
