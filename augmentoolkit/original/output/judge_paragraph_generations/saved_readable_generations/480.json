{"paragraph": "The serpent, as protector of the hoard, now lies on the treasure house. The fear of the maternal womb of death has become the guardian of the treasure of life. That the snake in this connection is really a symbol of death, that is to say, of the dead libido, results from the fact that the souls of the dead, like the chthonic gods, appear as _serpents_, as dwellers in the kingdom of the mother of death.[744] This development of symbol allows us to recognize easily the transition of the originally very primitive significance of the crevice in the earth as mother to the meaning of treasure house, and can, therefore, support the etymology of _Hort_, \u201choard, treasure,\u201d as suggested by Kluge, \u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9, belonging to \u03ba\u1f72\u1fe6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, means the innermost womb of the earth (Hades); \u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, that Kluge adds, is of similar meaning, cavity or womb. Prellwitz does not mention this connection. Fick,[745] however, compares New High German _hort_, Gothic _huzd_, to Armenian _kust_, \u201cabdomen\u201d; Church Slavonian _\u010dista_, Vedic _kostha_ = abdomen, from the Indo-Germanic root _koustho -s_ = viscera, lower abdomen, room, store-room. Prellwitz compares \u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 = urinary bladder, bag, purse; Sanskrit _kustha-s_ = cavity of the loins; then \u03ba\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 = cavity, vault; \u03ba\u03cd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 = little chest, from \u03ba\u03c5\u03ad\u03c9 = I am pregnant. Here, from \u03ba\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 = cave, \u03ba\u03cd\u03c5\u03b1\u03c1 = hole, \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 = cup, \u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1 - depression under the eye, \u03ba\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 = swelling, wave, billow, \u03ba\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 = power, force, \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 = lord, Old Iranian _caur_, _cur_ = hero; Sanskrit _\u00e7ura -s_ = strong, hero. The fundamental Indo-Germanic roots[746] are _kevo_ = to swell, to be strong. From that the above-mentioned \u03ba\u03c5\u03ad\u03c9, \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03c1, \u03ba\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 and Latin _cavus_ = hollow, vaulted, cavity, hole; _cavea_ = cavity, enclosure, cage, scene and assembly; _caul\u00e6_ = cavity, opening, enclosure, stall[747]; _ku\u00e9y\u00f4_ = swell; participle, _kueyonts_ = swelling; _en-kueyonts_ = pregnant, \u1f10\u03b3\u03b7\u03c5\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd = Latin _inciens_ = pregnant; compare Sanskrit _vi-\u00e7v\u00e1-yan_ = ", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
