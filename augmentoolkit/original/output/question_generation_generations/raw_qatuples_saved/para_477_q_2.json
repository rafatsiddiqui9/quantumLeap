Its light to thee will then the Mothers show,    Some in their seats, the others stand or go,    At their own will: Formation, Transformation,    The Eternal Mind\u2019s eternal recreation,    Forms of all Creatures,\u2014there are floating free.    They\u2019ll see thee not! for only wraiths they see.    So pluck up heart,\u2014the danger then is great.    Go to the tripod ere thou hesitate,    And touch it with the key.\u201dCHAPTER V         SYMBOLISM OF THE MOTHER AND OF REBIRTHThe vision following the creation of the hero is described by Miss Miller as a \u201cthrong of people.\u201d This representation is known to us from dream interpretation as being, above all, the symbol of mystery.[423] Freud thinks that this choice of symbol is determined on account of its possibility of representing the idea. The bearer of the mystery is placed in opposition to the multitude of the ignorant. _The possession of the mystery cuts one off from intercourse with the rest of mankind._ For a very complete and smooth rapport with the surroundings is of great importance for the management of the libido and the _possession of a subjectively important secret generally creates a great disturbance_. It may be said that the whole art of life shrinks to the one problem of how the libido may be freed in the most harmless way possible. Therefore, the neurotic derives special benefit in treatment when he can at last rid himself of his various secrets. The symbol of the crowd of people, chiefly the streaming and moving mass, is, as I have often seen, substituted for the great excitement in the unconscious, especially in persons who are outwardly calm.",

    "question": "How does the author of the text relate the concept of a throng of people to the idea of mystery and its impact on social interaction?",
    "answer": "The author relates the \"throng of people\" to the concept of mystery by explaining that this representation is used to symbolize the idea of mystery and to differentiate the bearer of the mystery from the multitude of the ignorant. It highlights that possessing a mysterious knowledge or secret can isolate one from social interactions, as it interferes with the natural rapport needed for managing the libido.",
