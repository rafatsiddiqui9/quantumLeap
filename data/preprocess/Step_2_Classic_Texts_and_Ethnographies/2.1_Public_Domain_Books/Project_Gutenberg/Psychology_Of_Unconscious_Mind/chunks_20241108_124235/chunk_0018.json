  "original_text": "Faust takes the reverse course; for him the ascetic ideal means death.\nHe struggles for freedom and wins life, at the same time giving himself\nover to the Evil One; but through this he becomes the bringer of death\nto her whom he loves most, Marguerite. He tears himself away from pain\nand sacrifices his life in unceasing useful work, through which he saves\nmany lives.[114] His double mission as saviour and destroyer has already\nbeen hinted in a preliminary manner:\n\n  _Wagner_:\n\n              With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou\n              Receive the people’s honest veneration!\n\n  _Faust_:\n\n          Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,\n          Among these vales and hills surrounding,\n          Worse than the pestilence, have passed.\n          Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;\n          And I must hear, by all the living,\n          The shameless murderers praised at last!\n\nA parallel to this double rôle is that text in the Gospel of Matthew\nwhich has become historically significant:\n\n  “I came not to send peace, but a sword.”—_Matt._ x: 34.\n\nJust this constitutes the deep significance of Goethe’s Faust, that he\nclothes in words a problem of modern man which has been turning in\nrestless slumber since the Renaissance, just as was done by the drama of\nOedipus for the Hellenic sphere of culture. What is to be the way out\nbetween the Scylla of renunciation of the world and the Charybdis of the\nacceptance of the world?\n\nThe hopeful tone, voiced in the “Hymn to the God of Creation,” cannot\ncontinue very long with our author. The pose simply promises, but does\nnot fulfil. The old longing will come again, for it is a peculiarity of\nall complexes worked over merely in the unconscious[115] that they lose\nnothing of their original amount of affect. Meanwhile, their outward\nmanifestations can change almost endlessly. One might therefore consider\nthe first poem as an unconscious longing to solve the conflict through\npositive religiousness, somewhat in the same manner as they of the\nearlier centuries decided their conscious conflicts by opposing to them\nthe religious standpoint. This wish does not succeed. Now with the\nsecond poem there follows a second attempt which turns out in a\ndecidedly more material way; its thought is unequivocal. Only once\n“having gained one raptured glance ...” and then—to die.\n\nFrom the realms of the religious world, the attention, just as in\nFaust,[116] turns towards the sun of this world, and already there is\nsomething mingled with it which has another sense, that is to say, _the\nmoth which fluttered so long around the light that it burnt its wings_.\n\nWe now pass to that which Miss Miller offers for the better\nunderstanding of the poem. She says:\n\n  “This small poem made a profound impression upon me. I could not, of\n  course, find immediately a sufficiently clear and direct explanation\n  for it. However, a few days later when I once more read a certain\n  philosophical work, which I had read in Berlin the previous winter,\n  and which I had enjoyed very much, (I was reading it aloud to a\n  friend), I came across the following words: ‘La même aspiration\n  passionnée de la mite vers l’étoile, de l’homme vers Dieu.’ (The same\n  passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God.) I had\n  forgotten this sentence entirely, but it seemed very clear to me that\n  precisely these words had reappeared in my hypnagogic poem. In\n  addition to that it occurred to me that a play seen some years\n  previously, ‘La Mite et La Flamme,’ was a further possible cause of\n  the poem. It is easy to see how often the word ‘moth’ had been\n  impressed upon me.”\n\nThe deep impression made by the poem upon the author shows that she put\ninto it a large amount of love. In the expression “aspiration\npassionnée” we meet the passionate longing of the moth for the star, of\nman for God, and indeed, the moth is Miss Miller herself. Her last\nobservation that the word “moth” was often impressed upon her shows how\noften she had noticed the word “moth” as applicable to herself. _Her\nlonging for God resembles the longing of the moth for the “star.”_ The\nreader will recall that this expression has already had a place in the\nearlier material, “when the morning stars sang together,” that is to\nsay, the ship’s officer who sings on deck in the night watch. The\npassionate longing for God is the same as that longing for the singing\nmorning stars. It was pointed out at great length in the foregoing\nchapter that this analogy is to be expected: “Sic parvis componere magna\nsolebam.”\n\nIt is shameful or exalted just as one chooses, that the divine longing\nof humanity, which is really the first thing to make it human, should be\nbrought into connection with an erotic phantasy. Such a comparison jars\nupon the finer feelings. Therefore, one is inclined in spite of the\nundeniable facts to dispute the connection. An Italian steersman with\nbrown hair and black moustache, and the loftiest, dearest conception of\nhumanity! These two things cannot be brought together; against this not\nonly our religious feelings revolt, but our taste also rebels.\n\nIt would certainly be unjust to make a comparison of the two objects as\nconcrete things since they are so heterogeneous. One loves a Beethoven\nsonata but one loves caviar also. It would not occur to any one to liken\nthe sonata to caviar. It is a common error for one to judge the longing\naccording to the quality of the object. The appetite of the gourmand\nwhich is only satisfied with goose liver and quail is no more\ndistinguished than the appetite of the laboring man for corned beef and\ncabbage. The longing is the same; the object changes. Nature is\nbeautiful only by virtue of the longing and love given her by man. The\næsthetic attributes emanating from that has influence primarily on the\nlibido, which alone constitutes the beauty of nature. The dream\nrecognizes this well when it depicts a strong and beautiful feeling by\nmeans of a representation of a beautiful landscape. Whenever one moves\nin the territory of the erotic it becomes altogether clear how little\nthe object and how much the love means. The “sexual object” is as a rule\noverrated far too much and that only on account of the extreme degree to\nwhich libido is devoted to the object.\n\nApparently Miss Miller had but little left over for the officer, which\nis humanly very intelligible. But in spite of that a deep and lasting\neffect emanates from this connection which places divinity on a par with\nthe erotic object. The moods which apparently are produced by these\nobjects do not, however, spring from them, but are manifestations of her\nstrong love. When Miss Miller praises either God or the sun she means\nher love, that deepest and strongest impulse of the human and animal\nbeing.\n\nThe reader will recall that in the preceding chapter the following chain\nof synonyms was adduced: the singer—God of sound—singing morning\nstar—creator—God of Light—sun—fire—God of Love.\n\nAt that time we had placed sun and fire in parentheses. Now they are\nentitled to their right place in the chain of synonyms. With the\nchanging of the erotic impression from the affirmative to the negative\nthe symbols of light occur as the paramount object. In the second poem\nwhere the longing is clearly exposed it is by no means the terrestrial\nsun. Since the longing has been turned away from the real object, its\nobject has become, first of all, a subjective one, namely, God.\nPsychologically, however, God is the name of a representation-complex\nwhich is grouped around a strong feeling (the sum of libido). Properly,\nthe feeling is what gives character and reality to the complex.[117]\n_The attributes and symbols of the divinity must belong in a consistent\nmanner to the feeling_ (_longing, love, libido, and so on_). If one\nhonors God, the sun or the fire, then one honors one’s own vital force,\nthe libido. It is as Seneca says: “God is near you, he is with you, in\nyou.” God is our own longing to which we pay divine honors.[118] If it\nwere not known how tremendously significant religion was, and is, this\nmarvellous play with one’s self would appear absurd. There must be\nsomething more than this, however, because, notwithstanding its\nabsurdity, it is, in a certain sense, conformable to the purpose in the\nhighest degree. To bear a God within one’s self signifies a great deal;\nit is a guarantee of happiness, of power, indeed even of omnipotence, as\nfar as these attributes belong to the Deity. To bear a God within one’s\nself signifies just as much as to be God one’s self. In Christianity,\nwhere, it is true, the grossly sensual representations and symbols are\nweeded out as carefully as possible, which seems to be a continuation of\nthe poverty of symbols of the Jewish cult, there are to be found plain\ntraces of this psychology. There are even plainer traces, to be sure, in\nthe “becoming-one with God” in those mysteries closely related to the\nChristian, where the mystic himself is lifted up to divine adoration\nthrough initiatory rites. At the close of the consecration into the Isis\nmysteries the mystic was crowned with the palm crown,[119] he was placed\non a pedestal and worshipped as Helios.[120] In the magic papyrus of the\nMithraic liturgy published by Dieterich there is the ἱερός λόγος[121] of\nthe consecrated one:\n\n  Ἐγώ εἰμι σύμπλανος ὑμῖν ἀστὴρ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ βάθους ἀναλάμπων.[122]\n\nThe mystic in religious ecstasies put himself on a plane with the stars,\njust as a saint of the Middle Ages put himself by means of the stigmata\non a level with Christ. St. Francis of Assisi expressed this in a truly\npagan manner,[123] even as far as a close relationship with the brother\nsun and the sister moon. These representations of “becoming-one with\nGod” are very ancient. The old belief removed the becoming-one with God\nuntil the time after death; the mysteries, however, suggest this as\ntaking place already in this world. A very old text brings most\nbeautifully before one this unity with God; it is the song of triumph of\nthe ascending soul.[124]\n\n             “I am the God Atum, I who alone was.\n             I am the God Rê at his first splendor.\n             I am the great God, self-created, God of Gods,\n             To whom no other God compares.”\n\n  “I was yesterday and know to-morrow; the battle-ground of Gods was\n  made when I spoke. I know the name of that great God who tarries\n  therein.\n\n  “I am that great Phoenix who is in Heliopolis, who there keeps account\n  of all there is, of all that exists.\n\n  “I am the God Min, at his coming forth, who placed the feathers upon\n  my head.[125]\n\n  “I am in my country, I come into my city. Daily I am together with my\n  father Atum.[126]\n\n  “My impurity is driven away, and the sin which was in me is overcome.\n  I washed myself in those two great pools of water which are in\n  Heracleopolis, in which is purified the sacrifice of mankind for that\n  great God who abideth there.\n\n  “I go on my way to where I wash my head in the sea of the righteous. I\n  arrive at this land of the glorified, and enter through the splendid\n  portal.\n\n  “Thou, who standest before me, stretch out to me thy hands, it is I, I\n  am become one of thee. Daily am I together with my Father Atum.”",
