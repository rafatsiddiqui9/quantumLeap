(God, as huntsman, see above.) She has her name in common with Apollo, \u1f15\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2.[729] From the standpoint of the libido theory, this connection is easily understandable, because Apollo merely symbolizes the more positive side of the same amount of libido. The confusion of Hecate with Brimo as subterranean mother is understandable; also with Persephone and Rhea, the primitive all-mother. Intelligible through the maternal significance is the confusion with Ilithyia, the midwife. Hecate is also the direct goddess of births, \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2,[730] the multiplier of cattle, and goddess of marriage. Hecate, orphically, occupies the centre of the world as Aphrodite and Gaia, even as the world soul in general. On a carved gem[731] she is represented carrying the cross on her head. The beam on which the criminal was scourged is called \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7.[732] To her, as to the Roman Trivia, the triple roads, or _Scheideweg_, \u201cforked road,\u201d or crossways were dedicated. And where roads branch off or unite sacrifices of dogs were brought her; there the bodies of the executed were thrown; the sacrifice occurs at the _point of crossing_. Etymologically, _scheide_, \u201csheath\u201d; for example, sword-sheath, sheath for water-shed and sheath for vagina, is identical with _scheiden_, \u201cto split,\u201d or \u201cto separate.\u201d The meaning of a sacrifice at this place would, therefore, be as follows: to offer something to the mother at the place of junction or at the fissure. (Compare the sacrifice to the chthonic gods in the abyss.) The Temenos of Ge, the abyss and the well, are easily understood as the gates of life and death,[733] \u201cpast which every one gladly creeps\u201d (Faust), and sacrifices there his obolus or his \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af,[734] instead of his body, just as Hercules soothes Cerberus with the honey cakes.
