    "paragraph": "These examples, which allow us to recognize a clear sexual symbolism in the generation of fire, prove, therefore, since they originate from different times and different peoples, the existence of a universal tendency to credit to fire production not only a magical but also a sexual significance. This ceremonial or magic repetition of this very ancient, long-outlived observance shows how insistently the human mind clings to the old forms, and how deeply rooted is this very ancient reminiscence of fire boring. One might almost be inclined to see in the sexual symbolism of fire production a relatively late addition to the priestly lore. This may, indeed, be true for the ceremonial elaboration of the fire mysteries, but whether originally the generation of fire was in general a sexual action, that is to say, a \u201ccoitus-play,\u201d is still a question. That similar things occur among very primitive people we learn from the Australian tribe of the Watschandies,[302] who in the spring perform the following magic ceremonies of fertilization: They dig a hole in the ground, so formed and surrounded with bushes as to counterfeit a woman\u2019s genitals. They dance the night long around this hole; in connection with this they hold spears in front of themselves in a manner to recall the penis in erection. They dance around the hole and thrust their spears into the ditch, while they cry to it, \u201cPulli nira, pulli nira, _wataka_!\u201d (Non fossa, non fossa, sed cunnus!) Such obscene dances appear among other primitive races as well.[303]",

    "question": "How do the examples of fire production ceremonies among different peoples support the idea of a universal tendency towards sexual symbolism in fire?",
    "answer": "The examples show that different peoples, regardless of time or culture, attribute a sexual significance to the act of fire production. This is evident in ceremonies where the act of generating fire is performed in ways that mimic sexual acts, suggesting a persistent cultural connection between fire and sexuality.",
