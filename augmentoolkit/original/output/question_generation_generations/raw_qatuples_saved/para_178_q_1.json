    "paragraph": "It appears as if, by this means of phantastic analogy formation, more libido would gradually become desexualized, because increasingly more phantasy correlates were put in the place of the primitive achievement of the sexual libido. With this an enormous broadening of the world idea was gradually developed because new objects were always assimilated as sexual symbols. It is a question whether the human consciousness has not been brought to its present state entirely or in great part in this manner. It is evident, in any case, that an important significance in the development of the human mind is due to the impulse towards the discovery of analogy. We must agree thoroughly with Steinthal when he says that an absolutely overweening importance must be granted to the little phrase \u201cGleich wie\u201d (even as) in the history of the development of thought. It is easy to believe that the carryover of the libido to a phantastic correlate has led primitive man to a number of the most important discoveries.CHAPTER III THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LIBIDO. A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF PRIMITIVE HUMAN                DISCOVERIESThese regressive phenomena show that even from the distance of the modern mind those early stages of the libido can be regressively reached. One may assume, therefore, that in the earliest states of human development this road was much more easily travelled than it is to-day. It becomes then a matter of great interest to learn whether traces of this have been preserved in history.",

    "question": "How does the text suggest that the impulse towards discovering analogy has influenced human thought?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that the impulse towards discovering analogy has played an important role in the development of the human mind. It is noted that the phrase \"Gleich wie\" (even as) has been given an absolutely overweening importance in the history of thought. The carryover of libido to phantastic correlates is believed to have led primitive man to several important discoveries.",
