    "paragraph": "Before turning to this new creation arising from introversion, there is still a further significance of the preceding question to be considered: whether life is dependent upon \u201cthese things\u201d? Life may depend upon these things in the degree that they serve _for nourishment_. We must infer in this case that suddenly the question of nutrition came very near the hero\u2019s heart. (This possibility will be thoroughly proven in what follows.) The question of nutrition, indeed, enters seriously into consideration. First, because regression to the mother necessarily revives that special path of transference; namely, that of nutrition through the mother. As soon as the libido regresses to the presexual stage, there we may expect to see the function of nutrition and its symbols put in place of the sexual function. Thence is derived an essential root of the displacement from below upwards (Freud), because, in the presexual stage, the principal value belongs not to the genitals, but to the mouth. Secondly, because the hero fasted, his hunger becomes predominant. Fasting, as is well known, is employed to silence sexuality; also, it expresses symbolically the resistance against sexuality, translated into the language of the presexual stage. On the fourth day of his fast the hero ceased to address himself to nature; he lay exhausted, with half-closed eyes, upon his couch, sunk deep in dreams, the picture of extreme introversion.We have already seen that, in such circumstances, an infantile internal equivalent for reality appears, in the place of external life and reality. This is also the case with Hiawatha:",

    "question": "What does the hero's extreme introversion on the fourth day of fasting indicate, and how does it relate to infantile internal equivalents?\n\n**ANS:** \nThe hero's extreme introversion on the fourth day of fasting indicates a deep psychological state where external life and reality are replaced by an infantile internal equivalent. This internal reality is a manifestation of the hero's internal world, where his thoughts and experiences are intensely focused inward, much like an infant's perception of the world.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the concept of regression to the presexual stage apply to the interpretation of Hiawatha\u2019s state of extreme introversion?",
    "answer": "The concept of regression to the presexual stage applies to Hiawatha\u2019s state of extreme introversion in the same way as it does for the hero. When Hiawatha fasts and becomes exhausted, his internal reality becomes dominated by infantile internal equivalents, similar to the hero lying on his couch, deep in dreams. This state reflects a psychological regression where external life is replaced by internal symbols and experiences, particularly those associated with nutrition and the presexual stage.",
