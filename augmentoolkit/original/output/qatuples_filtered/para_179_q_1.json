    "paragraph": "\u201cThe tree of knowledge\u201d of the Hindoo Dschaina sect assumes human form; it was represented as a mighty, thick trunk in the form of a human head, from the top of which grew out two longer branches hanging down at the sides and one short, vertical, uprising branch crowned by a bud or blossom-like thickening.[559] Robertson in his \u201cEvangelical Myths\u201d mentions that in the Assyrian system there exists the representation of the divinity in the form of a cross, in which the vertical beam corresponds to a human form and the horizontal beam to a pair of conventionalized wings. Old Grecian idols such, for example, as were found in large numbers in Aegina have a similar character, an immoderately long head and arms slightly raised, wing-shaped, and in front distinct breasts.[560]I must leave it an open question as to whether the symbol of the cross has any relation to the two pieces of wood in the religious fire production, as is frequently claimed. It does appear, however, as if the cross symbol actually still possessed the significance of \u201cunion,\u201d for this idea belongs to the fertility charm, and especially to the thought of eternal rebirth, which is most intimately bound up with the cross. The thought of \u201cunion,\u201d expressed by the symbol of the cross, is met with in \u201cTimaios\u201d of Plato, where the world soul is conceived as stretched out between heaven and earth in the form of an X (Chi); hence in the form of a \u201cSt. Andrew\u2019s cross.\u201d When we now learn, furthermore, that the world soul contains in itself _the world as a body_, then this picture inevitably reminds us of the mother.(_Dialogues of Plato._ Jowett, Vol. II, page 528.)",

    "question": "What does the cross symbol represent in terms of significance and how is it related to fertility charm and eternal rebirth?",
    "answer": "The cross symbol represents the idea of \"union,\" which is significant in the context of fertility charm and eternal rebirth. This symbol is closely tied to thoughts of eternal rebirth, making it a powerful fertility charm. The union symbolized by the cross is evident in Plato\u2019s \"Timaios,\" where the world soul is conceived as stretching between heaven and earth in the form of an X (Chi), or a \"St. Andrew\u2019s cross.\"",
