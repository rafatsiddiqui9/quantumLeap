    "paragraph": "These few references to the symbolic nature of dreams are perhaps sufficient. For whomsoever the proof may appear insufficient, and it is certainly insufficient for a beginner, further evidence may be found in the fundamental work of Freud, and in the works of Stekel and Rank which are fuller in certain particulars. We must assume here that the dream symbolism is an established fact, in order to bring to our study a mind suitably prepared for an appreciation of this work. We would not be successful if we, on the contrary, were to be astonished at the idea that an intellectual image can be projected into our conscious psychic activity; an image which apparently obeys such wholly other laws and purposes than those governing the conscious psychic product._Why are dreams symbolic?_ Every \u201cwhy\u201d in psychology is divided into two separate questions: first, _for what purpose are dreams symbolic_? We will answer this question only to abandon it at once. Dreams are symbolic in order that they can not be understood; in order that the wish, which is the source of the dream, may remain unknown. The question why this is so and not otherwise, leads us out into the far-reaching experiences and trains of thought of the Freudian psychology.Here the second question interests us, viz., _How is it that dreams are symbolic?_ That is to say, from where does this capacity for symbolic representation come, of which we, in our conscious daily life, can discover apparently no traces?",

    "question": "What is the symbolic nature of dreams, and why is it important to assume this fact in studying dreams?",
    "answer": "The symbolic nature of dreams refers to their representation of thoughts, feelings, and desires in a symbolic form rather than a literal one. We must assume this fact to bring a prepared mind to the study of dreams, as it allows for an appreciation of their deeper meanings.",
