{"paragraph": "A similar motive is found in the \u201cDeluge\u201d of Rubens (in the Munich Art Gallery), where a serpent emasculates a man. This motive explains the meaning of the \u201cDeluge\u201d; the maternal sea is also the devouring mother.[853] The phantasy of the world conflagration, of the cataclysmic end of the world in general, is nothing but a mythological projection of a personal individual will for death; therefore, Rubens could represent the essence of the \u201cDeluge\u201d phantasy in the emasculation by the serpent; for the serpent is our own repressed will for the end, for which we find an explanation only with the greatest difficulty.Concerning the symbolism of the serpent in general, its significance is very dependent upon the time of life and circumstances. The repressed sexuality of youth is symbolized by the serpent, because the arrival of sexuality puts an end to childhood. To age, on the contrary, the serpent signifies the repressed thought of death. With our author it is the insufficiently expressed sexuality which as serpent assumes the r\u00f4le of sacrificer and delivers the hero over to death and rebirth.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
