    "paragraph": "_Hort_ is a medi\u00e6val and Old High German word with the meaning of \u201ccollected and guarded treasure\u201d; Gothic, _huzd_; Old Scandinavian, _hodd_; Germanic _hozda_, from pre-Germanic _kuzdh\u00f3_\u2014for _kudtho_\u2014\u201cthe concealed.\u201d Kluge[706] adds to this the Greek \u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9, \u03ad\u03ba\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd = \u201cto hide, to conceal.\u201d Also _hut_ (_hut_, to guard; English, hide), Germanic root _hud_, from Indo-Germanic _kuth_ (questionable), to Greek \u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 and \u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, \u201ccavity,\u201d feminine genitals. Prellwitz,[707] too, traces Gothic _huzd_, Anglo-Saxon _hyde_, English hide and hoard, to Greek \u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9. Whitley Stokes traces English hide, Anglo-Saxon _hydan_, New High German _H\u00fctte_, Latin _c\u00fbdo_ = helmet; Sanskrit _kuhara_ (cave?) to primitive Celtic _koudo_ = concealment; Latin, _occultatio_.The assumption of Kluge is also supported in other directions; namely, from the point of view of the primitive idea:\u201cThere exists in Athens[708] a sacred place (a Temenos) of Ge, with  the surname Olympia. Here the ground is torn open for about a yard in  width; and they say, after the flood at the time of Deucalion, that  the water receded here; and every year they throw into the fissure  wheatmeal, kneaded with honey.\u201d",

    "question": "What other languages and terms are linked to the word \"Hort,\" and how do they relate to the concept of concealment?",
    "answer": "The term \"Hort\" is linked to several other languages and terms that relate to the concept of concealment. It is connected to Germanic _hud_ from Indo-Germanic _kuth_ (questionable), which is also associated with the Greek words \u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 and \u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2. Additionally, the English words \"hide\" and \"hoard\" are traced to Gothic _huzd_ and Anglo-Saxon _hyde_, which are also related to the Greek \u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9.",
