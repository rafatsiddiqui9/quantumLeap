    "paragraph": " Real difficulties alone will never be able to force the libido back permanently to such a degree as to give rise, for example, to a neurosis. _The conflict, which is the condition of every neurosis, is lacking._ The resistance, which opposes its unwillingness to the will, alone has the power to produce that pathogenic introversion which is the starting point of every psychogenic disturbance. The resistance against loving produces the inability to love. Just as the normal libido is comparable to a steady stream which pours its waters broadly into the world of reality, so the resistance, dynamically considered, is comparable, not so much to a rock rearing up in the river bed which is flooded over or surrounded by the stream, as to a backward flow towards the source. A part of the soul desires the outer object; another part, however, harks back to the subjective world, where the airy and fragile palaces of phantasy beckon. One can assume the dualism of the human will for which Bleuler, from the psychiatric point of view, has coined the word \u201cambitendency\u201d[343] as something generally present, bearing in mind that even the most primitive motor impulse is in opposition; as, for example, in the act of extension, the flexor muscles also become innervated. This normal ambitendency, however, never leads to an inhibition or prevention of the intended act, but is the indispensable preliminary requirement for its perfection and co\u00f6rdination. For a resistance disturbing to this act to arise from this harmony of finely attuned opposition an abnormal plus or minus would be needed on one or the other side. The resistance originates from this added third.[344] This applies also to the duality of the will, from which so many difficulties arise for mankind. The abnormal third frees the pair of opposites, which are normally most intimately united, and causes their manifestation in the form of separate tendencies; it is ",

    "question": "What does the author mean by the term \"ambitendency\" and how is it related to motor impulses and the human will?",
    "answer": "The term \"ambitendency\" refers to the dualism of the human will, where even the most primitive motor impulse is in opposition. For example, in the act of extension, the flexor muscles also become innervated, illustrating this dualistic tendency. Ambitendency is a normal phenomenon that ensures the perfection and coordination of intended acts.",
