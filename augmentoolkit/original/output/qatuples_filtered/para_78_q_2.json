    "paragraph": "Were I to suppose among my readers a far-reaching ignorance of dream analysis, then I should be obliged to illustrate this statement with numerous examples. To-day, however, these things are quite well known, so that one must proceed carefully with every-day dream material, out of consideration for a public educated in these matters. It is a special inconvenience that no dream can be recounted without being obliged to add to it half a life\u2019s history which affords the individual foundations of the dream, but there are some few typical dreams which can be told without too great a ballast. One of these is the dream of the sexual assault, which is especially prevalent among women. A girl sleeping after an evening happily spent in dancing, dreams that a robber breaks open her door noisily and stabs through her body with a lance. This theme, which explains itself, has countless variations, some simple, some complicated. Instead of the lance it is a sword, a dagger, a revolver, a gun, a cannon, a hydrant, a watering pot; or the assault is a burglary, a pursuit, a robbery, or it is some one hidden in the closet or under the bed. Or the danger may be illustrated by wild animals; for instance, a horse which throws the dreamer to the ground and kicks her in the body with his hind foot; lions, tigers, elephants with threatening trunks, and finally snakes in endless variety. Sometimes the snake creeps into the mouth, sometimes it bites the breast like Cleopatra\u2019s legendary asp, sometimes it comes in the r\u00f4le of the paradisical snake, or in the variations of Franz Stuck, whose pictures of snakes bear the significant titles \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cSin,\u201d \u201cLust.\u201d The mixture of lust and anxiety is expressed incomparably in the very atmosphere of these pictures, and far more brutally, indeed, than in M\u00f6rike\u2019s charming poem._The Maiden\u2019s First Love Song_",

    "question": "Describe the prevalence and variations of the theme of snakes in dreams of sexual assault.",
    "answer": "Snakes are a common element in the variations of dreams of sexual assault. They can appear in different forms and scenarios. Sometimes the snake creeps into the dreamer's mouth, sometimes it bites the breast like Cleopatra\u2019s legendary asp, and sometimes it assumes the role of the paradisical snake or in the variations of Franz Stuck, where the snakes are depicted with titles like \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cSin,\u201d and \u201cLust.\u201d These variations highlight the mixture of lust and anxiety in the dream, a theme that is expressed through the symbolic representation of snakes in the artwork of Franz Stuck, which is noted for its powerful and direct expression of these feelings.",
