    "paragraph": "The sacrifice, with its mysterious and manifold meaning, which is rather hinted at than expressed, passes unrecognized in the unconscious of our author. The arrow is not shot, the hero Chiwantopel is not yet fatally poisoned and ready for death through self-sacrifice. We now can say, according to the preceding material, this sacrifice means renouncing the mother, that is to say, _renunciation of all bonds and limitations which the soul has taken with it from the period of childhood into the adult life_. From various hints of Miss Miller\u2019s it appears that at the time of these phantasies she was still living in the circle of the family, evidently at an age which was in urgent need of independence. That is to say, man does not live very long in the infantile environment or in the bosom of his family without real danger to his mental health. Life calls him forth to independence, and he who gives no heed to this hard call because of childish indolence and fear is threatened by a neurosis, and once the neurosis has broken out it becomes more and more a valid reason to escape the battle with life and to remain for all time in the morally poisoned infantile atmosphere.",

    "answer": "Life outside the infantile environment or family circle is essential for mental health. Staying within the infantile environment can pose real dangers, and individuals who resist becoming independent due to childish fear and indolence are at risk of developing neuroses.",
