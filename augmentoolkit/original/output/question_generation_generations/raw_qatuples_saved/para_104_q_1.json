    "paragraph": "Etymology also confirms this conception: There is an Indo-Germanic root _v\u00e9lu-_, _vel-_, with the meaning of \u201cencircling, surrounding, turning.\u201d From this is derived Sanskrit _val_, _valati_ = to cover, to surround, to encircle, to encoil (symbol of the snake); _vall\u00ee_ = creeping plant; _ul\u00fbta_ = boa-constrictor = Latin _vol\u00fbtus_, Lithuanian _vel\u00f9_, _velti_ = _wickeln_ (to roll up); Church Slavonian _vlina_ = Old High German, _wella_ = _Welle_ (wave or billow). To the root _v\u00e9lu_ also belongs the root _vlvo_, with the meaning \u201ccover, corium, womb.\u201d (The serpent on account of its casting its skin is an excellent symbol of rebirth.) Sanskrit _ulva_, _ulba_ has the same meaning; Latin _volva_, _volvula_, _vulva_. To _v\u00e9lu_ also belongs the root _ulvor\u00e2_, with the meaning of \u201cfruitful field, covering or husk of plants, sheath.\u201d Sanskrit _urv\u00e1r\u00e2_ = sown field. Zend _urvara_ = plant. (See the personification of the ploughed furrow.) The same root _vel_ has also the meaning of \u201cwallen\u201d (to undulate). Sanskrit _ulmuka_ = conflagration. \u03dc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1, \u03dc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1, Gothic _vulan_ = _wallen_ (to undulate). Old High German and Middle High German _walm_ = heat, glow.[494] It is typical that in the state of \u201cinvolution\u201d the hair of the sun-hero always falls out from the heat. Further the root _vel_ is found with the meaning \u201cto sound,[495] and to will, to wish\u201d (libido!).",
