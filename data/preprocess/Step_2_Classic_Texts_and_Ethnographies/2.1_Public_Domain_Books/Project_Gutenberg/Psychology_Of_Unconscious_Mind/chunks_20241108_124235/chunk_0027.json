That it is there\napplicable is best shown in Freud’s brilliant investigation of\nSchreber’s phantasies. The question now is whether this genetic\nconception of libido proposed by me is suitable for the neuroses. I\nbelieve that this question may be answered affirmatively. “Natura non\nfecit saltum”—it is not merely to be expected but it is also probable\nthat at least temporary functional disturbances of various degrees\nappear in the neuroses, which transcend the boundaries of the immediate\nsexual; in any case, this occurs in psychotic episodes. I consider the\nbroadening of the conception of libido which has developed through the\nmost recent analytic work as a real advance which will prove of especial\nadvantage in the important field of the introversion psychoses. Proofs\nof the correctness of my assumption are already at hand. It has become\napparent through a series of researches of the Zurich School, which are\nnow published in part,[270] that the phantastic substitution products\nwhich take the place of the disturbed function of reality bear\nunmistakable traces of archaic thought. This confirmation is parallel to\nthe postulate asserted above, according to which reality is deprived,\nnot merely of an immediate (individual) amount of libido, but also of an\nalready differentiated or desexualized quantity of libido, which, among\nnormal people, has belonged to the function of reality ever since\nprehistoric times. _A dropping away of the last acquisition of the\nfunction of reality (or adaptation) must of necessity be replaced by an\nearlier mode of adaptation._ We find this principle already in the\ndoctrines of the neuroses, that is, that a repression resulting from the\nfailure of the recent transference is replaced by an old way of\ntransference, namely, through a regressive revival of the parent imago.\nIn the transference neurosis (hysterical), where merely a part of the\n_immediate sexual_ libido is taken away from reality by the specific\nsexual repression, the substituted product is a phantasy of individual\norigin and significance, with only a trace of those archaic traits found\nin the phantasies of those mental disorders in which a portion of the\ngeneral human function of reality organized since antiquity has broken\noff. This portion can be replaced only by a generally valid archaic\nsurrogate. We owe a simple and clear example of this proposition to the\ninvestigation of Honegger.[271] A paranoic of good intelligence who has\na clear idea of the spherical form of the earth and its rotation around\nthe sun replaces the modern astronomical views by a system worked out in\ngreat detail, which one must call archaic, in which the earth is a flat\ndisc over which the sun travels.[272] (I am reminded of the sun-phallus\nmentioned in the first part of this book, for which we are also indebted\nto Honegger.) Spielrein has likewise furnished some very interesting\nexamples of archaic definitions which begin in certain illnesses to\noverlay the real meanings of the modern word. For example, Spielrein’s\npatient had correctly discovered the mythological significance of\nalcohol, the intoxicating drink, to be “an effusion of seed.”[273] She\nalso had a symbolism of boiling which I must place parallel to the\nespecially important alchemistic vision of Zosimos,[274] who found\npeople in boiling water within the cavity of the altar.[275] This\npatient used earth in place of mother, and also water to express\nmother.[276] I refrain from further examples because future work of the\nZurich School will furnish abundant evidence of this sort.\n\n\nMy foregoing proposition of the replacement of the disturbed function of\nreality by an archaic surrogate is supported by an excellent paradox of\nSpielrein’s. She says: “I often had the illusion that these patients\nmight be simply victims of a folk superstition.” As a matter of fact,\npatients substitute phantasies for reality, phantasies similar to the\nactually incorrect mental products of the past, which, however, were\nonce the view of reality. As the Zosimos vision shows, the old\nsuperstitions were symbols[277] which permitted transitions to the most\nremote territory. This must have been very expedient for certain archaic\nperiods, for by this means convenient bridges were offered to lead a\npartial amount of libido over into the mental realm. Evidently Spielrein\nthinks of a similar biological meaning of the symbols when she\nsays:[278]\n\n  “Thus a symbol seems to me to owe its origin in general to the\n  tendency of a complex for dissolution in the common totality of\n  thought.... The complex is robbed by that of the personal element....\n  This tendency towards dissolution (transformation) of every individual\n  complex is the motive for poetry, painting, for every sort of art.”\n\nWhen here we replace the formal conception “complex” by the conception\nof the quantity of libido (the total effect of the complex), which, from\nthe standpoint of the libido theory, is a justified measure, then does\nSpielrein’s view easily agree with mine. When primitive man understands\nin general what an act of generation is, then, according to the\nprinciple of the path of least resistance, he never can arrive at the\nidea of replacing the generative organs by a sword-blade or a shuttle;\nbut this is the case with certain Indians, who explain the origin of\nmankind by the union of the two transference symbols. He then must be\ncompelled to devise an analogous thing in order to bring a manifest\nsexual interest upon an asexual expression. The propelling motive of\nthis transition of the _immediate sexual_ libido to the non-sexual\nrepresentation can, in my opinion, be found only in a _resistance which\nopposes primitive sexuality_.\n\nIt appears as if, by this means of phantastic analogy formation, more\nlibido would gradually become desexualized, because increasingly more\nphantasy correlates were put in the place of the primitive achievement\nof the sexual libido. With this an enormous broadening of the world idea\nwas gradually developed because new objects were always assimilated as\nsexual symbols. It is a question whether the human consciousness has not\nbeen brought to its present state entirely or in great part in this\nmanner. It is evident, in any case, that an important significance in\nthe development of the human mind is due to the impulse towards the\ndiscovery of analogy. We must agree thoroughly with Steinthal when he\nsays that an absolutely overweening importance must be granted to the\nlittle phrase “Gleich wie” (even as) in the history of the development\nof thought. It is easy to believe that the carryover of the libido to a\nphantastic correlate has led primitive man to a number of the most\nimportant discoveries.\n\n\n\n\n                              CHAPTER III\n THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LIBIDO. A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF PRIMITIVE HUMAN\n                              DISCOVERIES\n\n\nIn the following pages I will endeavor to picture a concrete example of\nthe transition of the libido. I once treated a patient who suffered from\na depressive catatonic condition. The case was one of only a slight\nintroversion psychosis; therefore, the existence of many hysterical\nfeatures was not surprising. In the beginning of the analytic treatment,\nwhile telling of a very painful occurrence she fell into a\nhysterical-dreamy state, in which she showed all signs of sexual\nexcitement. For obvious reasons she lost the knowledge of my presence\nduring this condition. The excitement led to a masturbative act (frictio\nfemorum). This act was accompanied by a peculiar gesture. She made a\nvery _violent rotary motion_ with the forefinger of the left hand on the\nleft temple, as if she were boring a hole there. Afterwards there was\ncomplete amnesia for what had happened, and there was nothing to be\nlearned about the queer gesture with her hand. Although this act can\neasily be likened to a boring into the mouth, nose or ear, now\ntransferred to the temple, it belongs in the territory of infantile\nludus sexualis[279]—to the preliminary exercise preparatory to sexual\nactivity. Without really understanding it, this gesture, nevertheless,\nseemed very important to me. Many weeks later I had an opportunity to\nspeak to the patient’s mother, and from her I learned that her daughter\nhad been a very exceptional child. When only two years old she would sit\nwith her back to an open cupboard door for hours and rhythmically beat\nher head against the door[280]—to the distraction of the household. A\nlittle later, instead of playing as other children, she began to bore a\nhole with her finger in the plaster of the wall of the house. She did\nthis with little turning and scraping movements, and kept herself busy\nat this occupation for hours. She was a complete puzzle to her parents.\nFrom her fourth year she practised onanism. It is evident that in this\nearly infantile activity the preliminary stage of the later trouble may\nbe found. The especially remarkable features in this case are, first,\nthat the child did not carry out the action on its own body, and,\nsecondly, the assiduity with which it carried on the action.[281] One is\ntempted to bring these two facts into a causal relationship and to say,\nbecause the child does not accomplish this action on her own body,\nperhaps that is the reason of the assiduity, for by boring into the wall\nshe never arrives at the same satisfaction as if she executed the\nactivity onanistically on her own body.\n\nThe very evident onanistic boring of the patient can be traced back to a\nvery early stage of childhood, which is prior to the period of local\nonanism. That time is still psychologically very obscure, because\nindividual reproductions and memories are lacking to a great extent, the\nsame as among animals. The race characteristics (manner of life)\npredominate during the entire life of the animal, whereas among men the\nindividual character asserts itself over the race type. Granting the\ncorrectness of this remark, we are struck with the apparently wholly\nincomprehensible individual activity of this child at this early age. We\nlearn from her later life history that her development, which is, as is\nalways the case, intimately interwoven with parallel external events,\nhas led to that mental disturbance which is especially well known on\naccount of its individuality and the originality of its productions, i.\ne. dementia præcox. The peculiarity of this disturbance, as we have\npointed out above, depends upon the predominance of the phantastic form\nof thought—of the infantile in general. From this type of thinking\nproceed all those numerous contacts with mythological products, and that\nwhich we consider as original and wholly individual creations are very\noften creations which are comparable with nothing but those of\nantiquity. I believe that this comparison can be applied to all\nformations of this remarkable illness, and perhaps also to this special\nsymptom of boring. We have already seen that the onanistic boring of the\npatient dated from a very early stage of childhood, that is to say, it\nwas reproduced from that period of the past. The sick woman fell back\nfor the first time into the early onanism only after she had been\nmarried many years, and following the death of her child, with whom she\nhad identified herself through an overindulgent love. When the child\ndied the still healthy mother was overcome by early infantile symptoms\nin the form of scarcely concealed fits of masturbation, which were\nassociated with this very act of boring. As already observed, the\nprimary boring appeared at a time which preceded the infantile onanism\nlocalized in the genitals. This fact is of significance in so far as\nthis boring differs thereby from a similar later practice which appeared\nafter the genital onanism. The later bad habits represent, as a rule, a\nsubstitution for repressed genital masturbation, or for an attempt in\nthis direction. As such these habits (finger-sucking, biting the nails,\npicking at things, boring into the ears and nose, etc.) may persist far\ninto adult life as regular symptoms of a repressed amount of libido.",
