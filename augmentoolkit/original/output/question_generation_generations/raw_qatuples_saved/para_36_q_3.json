    "question": "What is the ethnological phantasy of boring, and provide examples of its significance?",
    "answer": "The ethnological phantasy of boring refers to the idea that early human activities, such as the act of boring, had deeper symbolic meanings related to sexual functions. Examples include the production of fire, which is seen as a substitute for coitus, and how the need to symbolize the sexual act led to the invention of fire-making.",
