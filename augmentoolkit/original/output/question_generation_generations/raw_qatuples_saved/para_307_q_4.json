    "paragraph": "Miss Miller\u2019s problem at this age was the common human problem: \u201cHow am I to be creative?\u201d Nature knows but one answer to that: \u201cThrough the child (don d\u2019amour!).\u201d \u201cBut how is the child attained?\u201d Here the terrifying problem emerges, which, as our analytic experience shows, is connected with the father,[73] where it cannot be solved; because the original sin of incest weighs heavily for all time upon the human race. The strong and natural love which binds the child to the father, turns away in those years during which the humanity of the father would be all too plainly recognized, to the higher forms of the father, to the \u201cFathers\u201d of the church, and to the Father God,[74] visibly represented by them, and in that there lies still less possibility of solving the problem. However, mythology is not lacking in consolations. Has not the _logos_ become flesh too? Has not the divine _pneuma_, even the _logos_, entered the Virgin\u2019s womb and lived among us as the son of man? That whirlwind of Anaxagoras was precisely the divine \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 which from out of itself has become the world. Why do we cherish the image of the Virgin Mother even to this day? Because it is always comforting and says without speech or noisy sermon to the one seeking comfort, \u201cI too have become a mother,\u201d\u2014through the \u201cidea which spontaneously produces its object.\u201dI believe that there is foundation enough at hand for a sleepless night, if those phantasies peculiar to the age of puberty were to become possessed of this idea\u2014the results would be immeasurable! All that is psychologic has an under and an over meaning, as is expressed in the profound remark of the old mystic: \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf, \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf, \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf, \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf, \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf, \u03c0\u1fb6\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf, \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9[75]\u2014",

    "question": "What does the old mystic's quote imply about the nature of reality and how can it be applied to understanding the problem of creativity and the child?",
    "answer": "The old mystic's quote, \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf, \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf, \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf, \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf, \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf, \u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf, \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9, implies that there is an interplay between the upper and lower aspects of reality. It suggests that understanding and embracing both the higher and lower forms of this interplay can lead to good fortune and enlightenment. In the context of creativity and the child, this quote can be applied to understanding that there are multiple perspectives and levels of experience that contribute to the quest for creativity, and that recognizing and integrating these can lead to a deeper and more fulfilling understanding of the problem.",
