    "paragraph": "It is not to be forgotten that the _sexual phantasies of the neurotic and the exquisite sexual language of dreams_ are regressive phenomena. The sexuality of the unconscious is not what it seems to be; _it is merely a symbol_; it is a thought bright as day, clear as sunlight, a decision, a step forward to every goal of life\u2014but expressed in the unreal sexual language of the unconscious, and in the thought form of an earlier stage; a resurrection, so to speak, of earlier modes of adaptation. When, therefore, the unconscious pushes into the foreground the coitus wish, negatively expressed, it means somewhat as follows: under similar circumstances primitive man acted in such and such a manner. The mode of adaptation which to-day is unconscious for us is carried on by the savage Negro of the present day, whose undertakings beyond those of nutrition appertain to sexuality, characterized by violence and cruelty. Therefore, in view of the archaic mode of expression of the Miller phantasy, we are justified in assuming the correctness of our interpretation for the lowest and nearest plane only. A deeper stratum of meaning underlies the earlier assertion that the figure of Chiwantopel has the character of Cassius, who has a lamb as a companion. Therefore, Chiwantopel is the portion of the dreamer\u2019s libido bound up with the mother (and, therefore, masculine); hence he is her infantile personality, the childishness of character, which as yet is unable to understand that one must leave father and mother, when the time is come, in order to serve the destiny of the entire personality. This is outlined in Nietzsche\u2019s words:\u201cFree dost thou call thyself? Thy dominant thought would I hear and  not that thou hast thrown off a yoke. Art thou one who had the right  to throw off a yoke? There are many who throw away their last value  when they throw away their servitude.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the text imply about the interpretation of the Miller phantasy and Chiwantopel?",
    "answer": "The text implies that the interpretation of the Miller phantasy is correct only on the lowest and nearest plane. It also suggests that the figure of Chiwantopel has a character similar to Cassius, who has a lamb as a companion, indicating that Chiwantopel is a part of the dreamer\u2019s libido bound up with the mother. This part of the libido is identified as the dreamer\u2019s infantile personality, representing childishness and a lack of understanding about the necessity to leave parents for the sake of personal development.",
