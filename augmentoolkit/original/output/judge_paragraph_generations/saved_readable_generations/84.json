{"paragraph": "All this experience suggests to us that we draw a parallel between the phantastical, mythological thinking of antiquity and the similar thinking of children, between the lower human races and dreams.[33] This train of thought is not a strange one for us, but quite familiar through our knowledge of comparative anatomy and the history of development, which show us how the structure and function of the human body are the results of a series of embryonic changes which correspond to similar changes in the history of the race. Therefore, the supposition is justified that ontogenesis corresponds in psychology to phylogenesis. Consequently, it would be true, as well, that the state of infantile thinking in the child\u2019s psychic life, as well as in dreams, is nothing but a re-echo of the prehistoric and the ancient.[34]In regard to this, Nietzsche takes a very broad and remarkable standpoint.[35]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
