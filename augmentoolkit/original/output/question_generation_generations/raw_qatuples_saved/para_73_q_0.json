    "paragraph": "He is confused in the tradition very much with Horus, with whom he also has the name in common. Hor-pi-chrud, as his real name[483] reads, is composed from _chrud_, \u201cchild,\u201d and _Hor_, from the adjective _hri_ = up, on top, and signifies the up-coming child, as the rising sun, and opposed to Osiris, who personifies the setting sun\u2014the sun of the west. Thus Osiris and Horpichrud or Horus are one being, both husband and son of the same mother, Hathor-Isis. The Chnum-Ra, the sun god of lower Egypt, represented as a ram, has at his side, as the female divinity of the land, Hatmehit, who wears the fish on her head. She is the mother and wife of Bi-neb-did (Ram, local name of Chnum-Ra). In the hymn of Hibis,[484] Amon-ra was invoked:\u201cThy (Chum-Ram) dwells in Mendes, united as the quadruple god Thmuis.  He is the phallus, the lord of the gods. The bull of his mother  rejoices in the cow (ahet, the mother) and man fructifies through his  semen.\u201dIn further inscriptions Hatmehit was directly referred to as the \u201cmother of Mendes.\u201d (Mendes is the Greek form of Bi-neb-did: ram.) She is also invoked as the \u201cGood,\u201d with the additional significance of _ta-nofert_, or \u201cyoung woman.\u201d The cow as symbol of the mother is found in all possible forms and variations of Hathor-Isis, and also in the female Nun (parallel to this is the primitive goddess Nit or Neith), the protoplasm which, related to the Hindoo Atman,[485] is equally of masculine and feminine nature. Nun is, therefore, invoked as Amon,[486] the original water,[487] which is in the beginning. He is also designated as the father of fathers, the mother of mothers. To this corresponds the invocation to the female side of Nun-Amon, of Nit or Neith.\u201cNit, the ancient, the mother of god, the mistress of Esne, the father  of fathers, the mother of mothers, who is the beetle and the vulture,  the being in its beginning.",

    "question": "What is the significance of Hor-pi-chrud's name in relation to the sun and Osiris?",
    "answer": "Hor-pi-chrud's name signifies the up-coming child, as the rising sun, and is opposed to Osiris, who personifies the setting sun\u2014the sun of the west. Hor-pi-chrud, therefore, represents the sun at its rising, symbolizing new beginnings and contrasted with Osiris, the symbol of the sun setting.",
