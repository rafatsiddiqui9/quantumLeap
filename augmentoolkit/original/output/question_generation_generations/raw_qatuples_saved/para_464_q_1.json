    "paragraph": "Hiawatha hears human speech in the sounds of Nature; thus he understands Nature\u2019s speech. The wind says, \u201cWawa.\u201d The cry of the wild goose is \u201cWawa.\u201d Wah-wah-taysee means the small glowworm which enchants him.

The later blending, whether pantheistic-philosophic or \u00e6sthetic, of the sentimental, cultured man with nature is, looked at retrospectively, a reblending with the mother, who was our primary object, and with whom we truly were once wholly one.[644] Therefore, it is not astonishing when we again see emerging in the poetical speech of a modern philosopher, Karl Jo\u00ebl, the old pictures which symbolize the unity with the mother, illustrated by the confluence of subject and object.

This process represents a deep, intuitive connection between early experiences and the broader natural environment.",
