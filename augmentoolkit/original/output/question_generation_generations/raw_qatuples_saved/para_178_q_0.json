    "paragraph": "It appears as if, by this means of phantastic analogy formation, more libido would gradually become desexualized, because increasingly more phantasy correlates were put in the place of the primitive achievement of the sexual libido. With this an enormous broadening of the world idea was gradually developed because new objects were always assimilated as sexual symbols. It is a question whether the human consciousness has not been brought to its present state entirely or in great part in this manner. It is evident, in any case, that an important significance in the development of the human mind is due to the impulse towards the discovery of analogy. We must agree thoroughly with Steinthal when he says that an absolutely overweening importance must be granted to the little phrase \u201cGleich wie\u201d (even as) in the history of the development of thought. It is easy to believe that the carryover of the libido to a phantastic correlate has led primitive man to a number of the most important discoveries.CHAPTER III THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LIBIDO. A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF PRIMITIVE HUMAN                DISCOVERIESThese regressive phenomena show that even from the distance of the modern mind those early stages of the libido can be regressively reached. One may assume, therefore, that in the earliest states of human development this road was much more easily travelled than it is to-day. It becomes then a matter of great interest to learn whether traces of this have been preserved in history.",

    "question": "What is the process described in the text that involves forming phantastic analogies, and what effect does it have on libido?",
    "answer": "The process described involves forming phantastic analogies, where more libido is gradually desexualized by introducing increasingly more phantasy correlates in place of primitive sexual symbols. This leads to an enormous broadening of the world idea as new objects are assimilated as sexual symbols. It is suggested that human consciousness may have been brought to its current state, at least in part, through this process.",
