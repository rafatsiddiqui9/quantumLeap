The impression made by this\nsimple reference may be likened to that wholly peculiar feeling which\narises in us if, for example, in the noise and tumult of a modern street\nwe should come across an ancient relic—the Corinthian capital of a\nwalled-in column, or a fragment of inscription. Just a moment ago we\nwere given over to the noisy ephemeral life of the present, when\nsomething very far away and strange appears to us, which turns our\nattention to things of another order; a glimpse away from the incoherent\nmultiplicity of the present to a higher coherence in history. Very\nlikely it would suddenly occur to us that on this spot where we now run\nbusily to and fro a similar life and activity prevailed two thousand\nyears ago in somewhat other forms; similar passions moved mankind, and\nman was likewise convinced of the uniqueness of his existence. I would\nliken the impression which the first acquaintance with the monuments of\nantiquity so easily leaves behind to that impression which Freud’s\nreference to the Oedipus legend makes—for while we are still engaged\nwith the confusing impressions of the variability of the Individual\nSoul, suddenly there is opened a revelation of the simple greatness of\nthe Oedipus tragedy—that never extinguished light of the Grecian\ntheatre.\n\nThis breadth of outlook carries in itself something of revelation. For\nus, the ancient psychology has long since been buried among the shadows\nof the past; in the schoolroom one could scarcely repress a sceptical\nsmile when one indiscreetly reckoned the comfortable matronly age of\nPenelope and the age of Jocasta, and comically compared the result of\nthe reckoning with the tragic-erotic struggles in the legend and drama.\nWe did not know at that time (and who knows even to-day?) that the\nmother can be the all-consuming passion of the son, which perhaps\nundermines his whole life and tragically destroys it, so that not even\nthe magnitude of the Oedipus Fate seems one jot overdrawn. Rare and\npathologically understood cases like Ninon de Lenclos and her son[4] lie\ntoo far removed from most of us to give a living impression. But when we\nfollow the paths traced out by Freud, we arrive at a recognition of the\npresent existence of such possibilities, which, although they are too\nweak to enforce incest, are still strong enough to cause disturbances of\nconsiderable magnitude in the soul. The admission of such possibilities\nto one’s self does not occur without a great burst of moral revulsion.\nResistances arise which only too easily dazzle the intellect, and,\nthrough that, make knowledge of self impossible. Whenever we succeed,\nhowever, in stripping feelings from more scientific knowledge, then that\nabyss which separates our age from the antique is bridged, and, with\nastonishment, we see that Oedipus is still a living thing for us. The\nimportance of such an impression should not be undervalued. We are\ntaught by this insight that there is an identity of elementary human\nconflicts existing independent of time and place. That which affected\nthe Greeks with horror still remains true, but it is true for us only\nwhen we give up a vain illusion that we are different—that is to say,\nmore moral, than the ancients. We of the present day have nearly\nsucceeded in forgetting that an indissoluble common bond binds us to the\npeople of antiquity. With this truth a path is opened to the\nunderstanding of the ancient mind; an understanding which so far has not\nexisted, and, on one side, leads to an inner sympathy, and, on the other\nside, to an intellectual comprehension. Through buried strata of the\nindividual soul we come indirectly into possession of the living mind of\nthe ancient culture, and, just precisely through that, do we win that\nstable point of view outside our own culture, from which, for the first\ntime, an objective understanding of their mechanisms would be possible.\nAt least that is the hope which we get from the rediscovery of the\nOedipus problem.\n\nThe enquiry made possible by Freud’s work has already resulted\nfruitfully; we are indebted to this stimulation for some bold attacks\nupon the territory of the history of the human mind. There are the works\nof Riklin,[5] Abraham,[6] Rank,[7] Maeder,[8] Jones,[9]—recently\nSilberer has joined their ranks with a beautiful investigation entitled\n“Phantasie und Mythus.”[10] We are indebted to Pfister[11] for a\ncomprehensive work which cannot be overlooked here, and which is of much\nimportance for Christian religious psychology. The leading purpose of\nthese works is the unlocking of historical problems through the\napplication of psychoanalytic knowledge; that is to say, knowledge drawn\nfrom the activity of the modern unconscious mind concerning specific\nhistorical material.\n\nI must refer the reader entirely to the specified works, in order that\nhe may gain information concerning the extent and the kind of insight\nwhich has already been obtained. The explanations are in many cases\ndubious in particulars; nevertheless, this detracts in no way from the\ntotal result. It would be significant enough if only the far-reaching\nanalogy between the psychologic structure of the historical relics and\nthe structure of the recent individual psychologic products alone were\ndemonstrated. This proof is possible of attainment for every intelligent\nperson through the work done up to this time. The analogy prevails\nespecially in symbolism, as Riklin, Rank, Maeder, and Abraham have\npointed out with illuminating examples; it is also shown in the\nindividual mechanisms of unconscious work, that is to say in repression,\ncondensation, etc., as Abraham explicitly shows.\n\nUp to the present time the psychoanalytic investigator has turned his\ninterest chiefly to the analysis of the individual psychologic problems.\nIt seems to me, however, that in the present state of affairs there is a\nmore or less imperative demand for the psychoanalyst to broaden the\nanalysis of the individual problems by a comparative study of historical\nmaterial relating to them, just as Freud has already done in a masterly\nmanner in his book on “Leonardo da Vinci.”[12] For, just as the\npsychoanalytic conceptions promote understanding of the historic\npsychologic creations, so reversedly historical materials can shed new\nlight upon individual psychologic problems. These and similar\nconsiderations have caused me to turn my attention somewhat more to the\nhistorical, in the hope that, out of this, new insight into the\nfoundations of individual psychology might be won.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER I\n                  CONCERNING THE TWO KINDS OF THINKING\n\n\nIt is a well-known fact that one of the principles of analytic\npsychology is that the dream images are to be understood symbolically;\nthat is to say, that they are not to be taken literally just as they are\npresented in sleep, but that behind them a hidden meaning has to be\nsurmised. It is this ancient idea of a dream symbolism which has\nchallenged not only criticism, but, in addition to that, the strongest\nopposition. That dreams may be full of import, and, therefore, something\nto be interpreted, is certainly neither a strange nor an extraordinary\nidea. This has been familiar to mankind for thousands of years, and,\ntherefore, seems much like a banal truth. The dream interpretations of\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans, and the story of Joseph who interpreted\nPharaoh’s dreams, are known to every one, and the dream book of\nArtemidorus is also familiar. From countless inscribed monuments of all\ntimes and peoples we learn of foreboding dreams, of significant, of\nprophetic and also of curative dreams which the Deity sent to the sick,\nsleeping in the temple. We know the dream of the mother of Augustus, who\ndreamt she was to be with child by the Deity transformed into a snake.\nWe will not heap up references and examples to bear witness to the\nexistence of a belief in the symbolism of dreams. When an idea is so\nold, and is so generally believed, it is probably true in some way, and,\nindeed, as is mostly the case, _is not literally true, but is true\npsychologically_. In this distinction lies the reason why the old fogies\nof science have from time to time thrown away an inherited piece of\nancient truth; because it was not literal but psychologic truth. For\nsuch discrimination this type of person has at no time had any\ncomprehension.\n\nFrom our experience, it is hardly conceivable that a God existing\noutside of ourselves causes dreams, or that the dream, eo ipso, foresees\nthe future prophetically. When we translate this into the psychologic,\nhowever, then the ancient theories sound much more reconcilable, namely,\n_the dream arises from a part of the mind unknown to us, but none the\nless important, and is concerned with the desires for the approaching\nday_. This psychologic formula derived from the ancient superstitious\nconception of dreams, is, so to speak, exactly identified with the\nFreudian psychology, which assumes a rising wish from the unconscious to\nbe the source of the dream.\n\nAs the old belief teaches, the Deity or the Demon speaks in symbolic\nspeech to the sleeper, and the dream interpreter has the riddle to\nsolve. In modern speech we say this means that the dream is a _series of\nimages, which are apparently contradictory and nonsensical, but arise in\nreality from psychologic material which yields a clear meaning_.\n\nWere I to suppose among my readers a far-reaching ignorance of dream\nanalysis, then I should be obliged to illustrate this statement with\nnumerous examples. To-day, however, these things are quite well known,\nso that one must proceed carefully with every-day dream material, out of\nconsideration for a public educated in these matters. It is a special\ninconvenience that no dream can be recounted without being obliged to\nadd to it half a life’s history which affords the individual foundations\nof the dream, but there are some few typical dreams which can be told\nwithout too great a ballast. One of these is the dream of the sexual\nassault, which is especially prevalent among women. A girl sleeping\nafter an evening happily spent in dancing, dreams that a robber breaks\nopen her door noisily and stabs through her body with a lance. This\ntheme, which explains itself, has countless variations, some simple,\nsome complicated. Instead of the lance it is a sword, a dagger, a\nrevolver, a gun, a cannon, a hydrant, a watering pot; or the assault is\na burglary, a pursuit, a robbery, or it is some one hidden in the closet\nor under the bed. Or the danger may be illustrated by wild animals; for\ninstance, a horse which throws the dreamer to the ground and kicks her\nin the body with his hind foot; lions, tigers, elephants with\nthreatening trunks, and finally snakes in endless variety. Sometimes the\nsnake creeps into the mouth, sometimes it bites the breast like\nCleopatra’s legendary asp, sometimes it comes in the rôle of the\nparadisical snake, or in the variations of Franz Stuck, whose pictures\nof snakes bear the significant titles “Vice,” “Sin,” “Lust.” The mixture\nof lust and anxiety is expressed incomparably in the very atmosphere of\nthese pictures, and far more brutally, indeed, than in Mörike’s charming\npoem.\n\n                  _The Maiden’s First Love Song_\n\n                    What’s in the net?\n                        Behold,\n                    But I am afraid,\n                    Do I grasp a sweet eel,\n                    Do I seize a snake?\n                        Love is a blind\n                        Fisherwoman;\n                        Tell the child\n                        Where to seize.\n                    Already it leaps in my hands.\n\n                    Oh, Pity, or delight!\n                    With nestlings and turnings\n                        It coils on my breast,\n                        It bites me, oh, wonder!\n                        Boldly through the skin,\n                        It darts under my heart.\n                    Oh, Love, I shudder!\n\n                    What can I do, what can I begin?\n                        That shuddering thing;\n                        There it crackles within\n                        And coils in a ring.\n                        It must be poisoned.\n                        Here it crawls around.\n                        Blissfully I feel as it worms\n                        Itself into my soul\n                        And kills me finally.\n\nAll these things are simple, and need no explanation to be intelligible.\nSomewhat more complicated, but still unmistakable, is the dream of a\nwoman; she sees the triumphal arch of Constantine. A cannon stands\nbefore it, to the right of it a bird, to the left a man. A shot flashes\nout of the tube; the projectile hits her; it goes into her pocket, into\nher purse. There it remains, and she holds her purse as if something\nvery precious were in it. The image disappears, and she continues to see\nonly the stock of the cannon, and over that Constantine’s motto, “In hoc\nsigno vinces.”",
