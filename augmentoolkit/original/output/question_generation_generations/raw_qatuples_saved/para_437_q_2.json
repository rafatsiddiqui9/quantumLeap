    "paragraph": "From these passages it appears that Christ stands on the same plane as Elias, without being identified with him,[375] although the people consider him as Elias. The ascension places Christ as identical with Elias. The prophecy of Christ shows that there exist aside from himself one or more immortals who shall not die until Parousai. According to John xxi: 22nd verse, the boy John was considered as one of these immortals, and in the legend he is, in fact, not dead but merely sleeping in the ground until Parousai, and breathes so that the dust swirls round his grave.[376] As is evident, there are passable bridges from Christ by way of Elias to Chidher and Ahasuerus. It is said in an account of this legend[377] that Dhulqarnein led his friend Chidher to the \u201csource of life\u201d in order to have him drink of immortality.[378] Alexander also bathed in the stream of life and performed the ritual ablutions. As I previously mentioned in a footnote, according to Matthew xvii: 12th verse, John the Baptist is Elias, therefore primarily identical with Chidher. Now, however, it is to be noted that in the Arabian legend Chidher appears rather as a companion or accompanied (Chidher with Dhulqarnein or with Elias, \u201clike unto them\u201d; or identified with them[379]). There are therefore, two similar figures who resemble each other, but who, nevertheless, are distinct. The analogous situation in the Christian legend is found in the scene by the Jordan where John leads Christ to the \u201csource of life.\u201d Christ is there, the subordinate, John the superior, similar to Dhulqarnein and Chidher, or Chidher and Moses, also Elias. The latter relation especially is such that Vollers compares Chidher and Elias, on the one side, with Gilgamesh and his mortal brother Eabani; on the other side, with the Dioscuri, one of whom is immortal, the other mortal. This relation is also found in Christ and John the Baptist,[380] on the one hand, and Christ and Peter, on the ",

    "question": "How does the relationship between Christ and John the Baptist in the Christian legend compare to the relationship between Dhulqarnein and Chidher or Chidher and Elias?\n\n**ANSQUER:**\nThe relationship between Christ and John the Baptist in the Christian legend can be compared to the relationship between Dhulqarnein and Chidher or Chidher and Elias. In both cases, one figure is described as subordinate or leading, while the other is superior or leading in a similar way. Vollers compares Chidher and Elias with Gilgamesh and Eabani, noting that Gilgamesh, like Christ, is the subordinate figure, while Eabani, like John the Baptist, is the superior figure. This comparison also applies to the relationship between Christ and Peter, where Christ is often seen as the leading or superior figure.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat are the similarities and differences between the figure of John the boy in the legend and the figure of John the Baptist in the Christian tradition?",
    "answer": "The figure of John the boy in the legend and the figure of John the Baptist in the Christian tradition share similarities in their roles as figures who can achieve or are believed to achieve immortality. John the boy is considered one of the immortals who will not die until Parousai and is associated with the Jordan, where he leads Christ to the \"source of life.\" John the Baptist, on the other hand, is identified with Elias in the Christian tradition, implying a primary identity with Chidher. The key difference lies in the context and the specific roles they play: while the boy John is a child in a sleeping state, John the Baptist is a significant religious figure in the Christian tradition.",
