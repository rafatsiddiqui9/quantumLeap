    "paragraph": "After we have informed ourselves about the general purposes of prayer, we are prepared to hear more about the vision of our dreamer. After the prayer, \u201cthe head of a sphinx with an Egyptian headdress\u201d appeared, only to vanish quickly. Here the author was disturbed, so that for a moment she awoke. This vision recalls the previously mentioned phantasy of the Egyptian statue, whose rigid gesture is entirely in place here as a phenomenon of the so-called functional category. The light stages of the hypnosis are designated technically as \u201cEngourdissement\u201d (stiffening). The word Sphinx in the whole civilized world signifies the same as riddle: a puzzling creature who proposes riddles, like the Sphinx of Oedipus, standing at the portal of his fate like a symbolic proclamation of the inevitable. The Sphinx is a semi-theriomorphic representation of that \u201cmother image\u201d which may be designated as the \u201cterrible mother,\u201d of whom many traces are found in mythology. This interpretation is correct for Oedipus. Here the question is opened. The objection will be raised that nothing except the word \u201cSphinx\u201d justifies the allusion to the Sphinx of Oedipus. On account of the lack of subjective materials, which in the Miller text are wholly lacking in regard to this vision, an individual interpretation would also be excluded. The suggestion of an \u201cEgyptian\u201d phantasy (Part I, Chapter II) is entirely insufficient to be employed here. Therefore we are compelled, if we wish to venture at all upon an understanding of this vision, to direct ourselves\u2014perhaps in all too daring a manner\u2014to the available ethnographic material under the assumption that the unconscious of the present-day man coins its symbols as was done in the most remote past. The Sphinx, in its traditional form, is a half-human, half-animal creature, which we must, in part, interpret in the way that is applicable to such phantastic products.",

    "question": "How does the vision of the sphinx relate to the concept of a riddle or puzzle?",
    "answer": "The vision of the sphinx is significant because in the whole civilized world, the sphinx is associated with riddles and puzzles. Just like the sphinx of Oedipus who stood at the portal of his fate, proposing a riddle, the sphinx in the dream symbolizes a puzzling creature that presents riddles.",
