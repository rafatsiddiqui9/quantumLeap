    "paragraph": "There is still to be considered one more source of the reanimation of the mother-imago. We have already met it in the discussion of the mother scene in \u201cFaust,\u201d that is to say, _the willed introversion of a creative mind_, which, retreating before its own problem and inwardly collecting its forces, dips at least for a moment into the source of life, in order there to wrest a little more strength from the mother for the completion of its work. It is a mother-child play with one\u2019s self, in which lies much weak selfadmiration and self-adulation (\u201cAmong a hundred mirrors\u201d\u2014Nietzsche); _a Narcissus state_, a strange spectacle, perhaps, for profane eyes. The separation from the mother-imago, the birth out of one\u2019s self, reconciles all conflicts through the sufferings. This is probably meant by Nietzsche\u2019s verse:\u201cWhy hast thou enticed thyself         Into the Paradise of the old serpent?         Why hast thou crept         Into thyself, thyself?...\u201cA sick man now         Sick of a serpent\u2019s poison,[620]         A captive now         Whom the hardest destiny befell         In thine own pit;         Bowed down as thou workest         Encaved within thyself,         Burrowing into thyself,         Helpless,         Stiff,         A corpse.         Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,         Overburdened by thyself.         A wise man,         A self-knower,         The wise Zarathustra;         Thou soughtest the heaviest burden         And foundest thou thyself....\u201d",

    "question": "What is the significance of the \"Narcissus state\" in the context of the text and the creative process?",
    "answer": "The \"Narcissus state\" is significant in the context of the text as it represents a form of introspection and self-admiration. It refers to a creative individual looking into their own psyche, much like Narcissus gazed at his reflection in the water. This state is described as a strange spectacle for those who are not familiar with it and symbolizes the deep introspective journey of the creative mind. It is a moment of self-reflection and self-adulation, where one deeply contemplates their own essence, akin to the \"Among a hundred mirrors\" reference from Nietzsche.",
