    "paragraph": "That \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2, the wood of life, or the tree of life, is a maternal symbol would seem to follow from the previous deductions. The etymologic connection of \u1f55\u03bf, \u1f55\u03bb\u03b5, \u03c5\u1f31\u03cc\u03c2, in the Indo-Germanic root suggests the blending of the meanings in the underlying symbolism of mother and of generation. The tree of life is probably, first of all, a fruit-bearing genealogical tree, that is, a mother-image. Countless myths prove the derivation of man from trees; many myths show how the hero is enclosed in the maternal tree\u2014thus dead Osiris in the column, Adonis in the myrtle, etc. Numerous female divinities were worshipped as trees, from which resulted the cult of the holy groves and trees. It is of transparent significance when Attis castrates himself under a pine tree, i. e. he does it because of the mother. Goddesses were often worshipped in the form of a tree or of a wood. Thus Juno of Thespi\u00e6 was a branch of a tree, Juno of Samos was a board. Juno of Argos was a column. The Carian Diana was an uncut piece of wood. Athene of Lindus was a polished column. Tertullian calls Ceres of Pharos \u201crudis palus et informe lignum sine effigie.\u201d Athenaeus remarks of Latona at Dalos that she is \u03be\u1f50\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f04\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd, a shapeless piece of wood.[445] Tertullian calls an Attic Pallas \u201ccrucis stipes,\u201d a wooden pale or mast. The wooden pale is phallic, as the name suggests, \u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, Pallus. The \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 is a pale, a ceremonial lingam carved out of figwood, as are all Roman statues of Priapus. \u03a6\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 means a projection or centrepiece on the helmet, later called \u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 just as \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb-\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 signifies baldheadedness on the forepart of the head, and \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 signifies baldheadedness in regard to the \u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2-\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 of the helmet; a semi-phallic meaning is given to the upper part of the head as well.[446] \u03a6\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 has, besides \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2, the significance of \u201cwooden\u201d; \u03c6\u03b1\u03bb-\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1, \u201ccylinder\u201d; \u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03be, \u201ca round beam.\u201d The Macedonian battle array, distinguished by its powerful ",
