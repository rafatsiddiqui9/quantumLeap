It has in fact\nled to a new evaluation of the whole conduct of human life; a new\ncomprehension has developed which explains those things which formerly\nwere unexplained, and there is offered an understanding not only of the\nsymptoms of a neurosis and the phenomena of conduct but the product of\nthe mind as expressed in myths and religions.\n\nThis amazing growth has proceeded steadily in an ever-widening fashion\ndespite opposition as violent as any of which we have knowledge in the\npast. The criticism originally directed towards the little understood\nand much disliked sexual conception now includes the further teachings\nof a psychology which by the application to it of such damning phrases\nas mystical, metaphysical and sacrilegious, is condemned as\nunscientific.\n\nTo add to the general confusion and misunderstanding surrounding this\nnew school of thought there has arisen a division amongst the leaders\nthemselves, so that there now exist two schools led respectively by\nProfessor Sigmund Freud of Vienna and Dr. Carl Jung of Zurich, referred\nto in the literature as the Vienna School and the Zurich School.\n\nIt is very easy to understand that criticism and opposition should\ndevelop against a psychology so difficult of comprehension, and so\ndisturbing to the ideas which have been held by humanity for ages; a\npsychology which furthermore requires a special technique as well as an\nobserver trained to recognize and appreciate in psychologic phenomena a\nverification of the statement that there is no such thing as chance, and\nthat every act and every expression has its own meaning, determined by\nthe inner feelings and wishes of the individual.\n\nIt is not a simple matter to come out boldly and state that every\nindividual is to a large extent the determiner of his own destiny, for\nonly by poets and philosophers has this idea been put forth—not by\nscience; and it is a brave act to make this statement with full\nconsciousness of all its meaning, and to stand ready to prove it by\nscientific reasoning and procedure.\n\nDeveloped entirely through empirical investigation and through an\nanalysis of individual cases, Freudian psychology seems particularly to\nbelong to that conception of Max Müller’s that “An empirical\nacquaintance with facts rises to a scientific knowledge of facts as soon\nas the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity of single productions the\nunity of an organic system.”[1]\n\nPsychoanalysis is the name given to the method developed for reaching\ndown into the hidden depths of the individual to bring to light the\nunderlying motives and determinants of his symptoms and attitudes, and\nto reveal the unconscious tendencies which lie behind actions and\nreactions and which influence development and determine the relations of\nlife itself. The result of digging down into the hidden psyche has been\nto produce a mass of material from below the threshold of consciousness,\nso astonishing and disturbing and out of relation with the previously\nheld values, as to arouse in any one unfamiliar with the process the\nstrongest antagonism and criticism.\n\nAlthough originally studied only as a therapeutic method for the sick it\nwas soon realized through an analysis of normal people how slight were\nthe differences in the content of the unconscious of the sick and of the\nnormal. The differences observed were seen to be rather in the reactions\nto life and to the conflicts produced by contending forces in the\nindividual.\n\nThese conflicts, usually not fully perceived by the individual, and\nhaving to do with objectionable desires and wishes that are not in\nkeeping with the conscious idea of self, produce marked effects which\nare expressed either in certain opinions, prejudices, attitudes of\nconduct, faulty actions, or in some definite pathologic symptom. As Dr.\nJung says, he who remains healthy has to struggle with the same\ncomplexes that cause the neurotic to fall ill.\n\nIn a valuable book called “The Neighbor,” written by the late Professor\nN. Shaler of Harvard University, there occurs this very far-reaching\nstatement: “It is hardly too much to say that all the important errors\nof conduct, all the burdens of men or of societies are caused by the\ninadequacies in the association of the primal animal emotions with those\nmental powers which have been so rapidly developed in mankind.”\n\nThis statement, reached by a process of reasoning and a method of\nthought and study entirely different from psychoanalysis, nevertheless\nso completely expresses in brief form the very basis of the postulates\ndeveloped through psychoanalysis that I quote it here. Such a statement\nmade in the course of a general examination of human relations does not\narouse opposition nor seem to be so difficult of acceptance. It appears\nto be the individual application of these conceptions that has roused\nsuch bitter antagonism and violent denunciations.\n\nRightly understood and used, psychoanalysis may be compared to surgery,\nfor psychoanalysis stands in the same relation to the personality as\nsurgery does to the body, and they aim at parallel results.\n\nIt is well recognized that in the last analysis nature is the real\nphysician, the healer of wounds; but prior to the development of our\nmodern asepsis and surgical technique the healing produced by nature was\nmost often of a very faulty and imperfect type—hideous scars, distorted\nand crippled limbs, with functions impaired or incapacitated, resulted\nfrom the wounds, or else nature was unable to cope with the hurt and the\ninjured one succumbed.\n\nScience has been steadily working for centuries with the aim of\nunderstanding nature and finding means to aid and co-operate with her so\nthat healing could take place with the least possible loss of function\nor permanent injury to the individual. Marvelous results have rewarded\nthese persistent efforts, as the brilliant achievements of surgery\nplainly indicate.\n\nMeantime, however, little thought was given to the possibility of any\nscientific method being available to help man overcome the wounds and\nconflicts taking place in his soul, hurts which retarded his development\nand progress as a personality, and which frequently in the struggle\nresulted in physical pains and symptoms of the most varied character.\nThat was left solely to religion and metaphysics. Now, however, this\nsame assistance that surgery has given to the physical body,\npsychoanalysis attempts to give to the personality. That it cannot\nalways succeed is as much to be expected, and more, than that surgery\ndoes not always succeed, for the analytic work requires much of the\nindividual. No real result can be attained if he has not already\ndeveloped a certain quality of character and intelligence which makes it\npossible for him to submit himself to a facing of his naked soul, and to\nthe pain and suffering which this often entails. Here, as in no other\nrelation in life, an absolute truth and an absolute honesty are the only\nbasis of action, since deception of any kind deceives no one but the\nindividual himself and acts as a boomerang, defeating his own aims.\n\nSuch deep searching and penetrating into the soul is not something to be\nundertaken lightly nor to be considered a trivial or simple matter, and\nthe fact is that where a strong compulsion is lacking, such as sickness\nor a situation too difficult to meet, much courage is required to\nundertake it.\n\nIn order to understand this psychology which is pervading all realms of\nthought and seems destined to be a new psychological-philosophical\nsystem for the understanding and practical advancement of human life, it\nwill be necessary to go somewhat into detail regarding its development\nand present status. For in this new direction lies its greatest value\nand its greatest danger.\n\nThe beginnings of this work were first published in 1895 in a book\nentitled “Studien über Hysterie,” and contained the joint investigations\ninto hysteria of Dr. Breuer of Vienna and his pupil Dr. Sigmund Freud.\nThe results of their investigations seemed to show that the various\nsymptoms grouped under the title of hysteria were the result of\nemotionally colored reminiscences which, all unknown to the conscious\nwaking self, were really actively expressing themselves through the\nsurrogate form of symptoms and that these experiences, although\nforgotten by the patient, could be reproduced and the emotional content\ndischarged.\n\nHypnosis was the means used to enable the physician to penetrate deeply\ninto the forgotten memories, for it was found through hypnosis that\nthese lost incidents and circumstances were not really lost at all but\nonly dropped from consciousness, and were capable of being revived when\ngiven the proper stimuli. The astonishing part about it was that with\nthe revival of these memories and their accompanying painful and\ndisturbing emotions, the symptoms disappeared. This led naturally to the\nconclusion that these symptoms were dependent upon some emotional\ndisturbance or psychic trauma which had been inadequately expressed, and\nthat in order to cure the patient one merely had to establish the\nconnection between the memory and the emotions which properly belonged\nto it, letting the emotion work itself out through a reproduction of the\nforgotten scene.\n\nWith further investigation Freud found that hypnosis was unnecessary for\nthe revival of the forgotten experiences, and that it was possible to\nobtain the lost emotional material in the conscious and normal state.\nFor this purpose the patient was encouraged to assume a passive,\nnon-critical attitude and simply let his thoughts flow, speaking of\nwhatever came into his mind, holding nothing back. During this free and\neasy discussion of his life and conditions, directed by the law of\nassociation of ideas, reference was invariably made to the experiences\nor thoughts which were the most affective and disturbing elements. It\nwas seen to be quite impossible to avoid this indirect revelation\nbecause of the strength of the emotions surrounding these ideas and the\neffect of the conscious wish to repress unpleasant feelings. This\nimportant group of ideas or impressions, with the feelings and emotions\nclustered around them which are betrayed through this process, was\ncalled by Jung a _complex_.\n\nHowever, with the touching of the _complex_ which always contains\nfeelings and emotions so painful or unpleasant as to be unacceptable to\nconsciousness, and which are therefore repressed and hidden, great\ndifficulties appeared, for very often the patient came to a sudden stop\nand could apparently recall nothing more. Memory gaps were frequent,\nrelations twisted, etc. Evidently some force banished these memories so\nthat the person was quite honest in saying that he could remember\nnothing or that there was nothing to tell. This kind of forgetfulness\nwas called _repression_, and is the normal mechanism by which nature\nprotects the individual from such painful feelings as are caused by\nunpleasant and unacceptable experiences and thoughts, the recognition of\nhis egoistic nature, and the often quite unbearable conflict of his\nweaknesses with his feelings of idealism.\n\nAt this early time great attention was given towards developing a\ntechnique which would render more easy the reproduction of these\nforgotten memories, for with the abandonment of hypnosis it was seen\nthat some unknown active force was at work which not only banished\npainful memories and feelings, but also prevented their return; this was\ncalled _resistance_. This resistance was found to be the important\nmechanism which interfered with a free flow of thought and produced the\ngreatest difficulty in the further conduct of the analysis. It appeared\nunder various guises and frequently manifested itself in intellectual\nobjections based on reasoning ground, in criticism directed towards the\nanalyst, or in criticism of the method itself, and finally, often in a\ncomplete blocking of expression, so that until the resistance was broken\nnothing more could be produced.\n\nIt was necessary then to find some aid by which these resistances could\nbe overcome and the repressed memories and feelings revived and set\nfree. For it was proven again and again that even though the person was\nnot at all aware of concealing within himself some emotionally\ndisturbing feeling or experience with which his symptoms were\nassociated, yet such was the fact, and that under proper conditions this\nmaterial could be brought into consciousness. This realm where these\nunknown but disturbing emotions were hidden was called the\n“Unconscious”—the “Unconscious” also being a name used arbitrarily to\nindicate all that material of which the person is not aware at the given\ntime—the not-conscious.\n\nThis term is used very loosely in Freudian psychology and is not\nintended to provoke any academic discussion but to conform strictly to\nthe dictionary classification of a “negative concept which can neither\nbe described nor defined.” To say that an idea or feeling is unconscious\nmerely means to indicate that the individual is unaware at that time of\nits existence, or that all the material of which he is unaware at a\ngiven time is unconscious.\n\nWith the discovery of the significance in relation to hysteria of these\nvaried experiences and forgotten memories which always led into the\nerotic realm and usually were carried far back into early childhood, the\ntheory of an infantile sexual trauma as a cause of this neurosis\ndeveloped. Contrary to the usual belief that children have no sexuality\nand that only at puberty does it suddenly arise, it was definitely shown\nthat there was a very marked kind of sexuality among children of the\nmost tender years, entirely instinctive and capable of producing a grave\neffect on the entire later life.",
