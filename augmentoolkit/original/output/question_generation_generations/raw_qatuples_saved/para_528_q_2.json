    "paragraph": "It is evident from this quotation, after all that goes before, that the City, the heavenly bride, who is here promised to the Son, is the mother.[438] In Babylon the impure maid was cast out, according to the Epistle to the Galatians, so that here in heavenly Jerusalem the mother-bride may be attained the more surely. It bears witness to the most delicate psychologic perception that the fathers of the church who formulated the canons preserved this bit of the symbolic significance of the Christ mystery. It is a treasure house for the phantasies and myth materials which underlie primitive Christianity.[439] The further attributes which were heaped upon the heavenly Jerusalem make its significance as mother overwhelmingly clear:(1) \u201cAnd he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,  proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.(2) \u201cIn the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the  river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits,  and yielded her fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for  the healing of nations.(3) \u201cAnd there shall be no more curse.\u201d",
