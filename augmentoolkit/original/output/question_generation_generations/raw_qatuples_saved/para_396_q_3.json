We have learned in the course of this investigation that the part of the libido which erects religious structures is in the last analysis fixed in the mother, and really represents that tie through which we are permanently connected with our origin. Briefly, we may designate this amount of libido as \u201cMother Libido.\u201d As we have seen, this libido conceals itself in countless and very heterogeneous symbols, also in animal images, no matter whether of masculine or feminine nature\u2014differences of sex are at bottom of a secondary value and psychologically do not play the part which might be expected from a superficial observation.",

    "question": "How is the concept of \"Mother Libido\" described in the text, and what role does it play in religious structures?\n\n**ANS\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u622a\u65ad\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u90fd\u88ab\u6db5\u76d6\uff1a\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat role does \"Mother Libido\" play in religious structures according to the text?",
    "answer": "According to the text, \"Mother Libido\" is the part of the libido that is fixed in the mother and represents the tie that connects us permanently with our origin. This libido is responsible for erecting religious structures and is concealed in countless and very heterogeneous symbols, including animal images that may be of either masculine or feminine nature. Sex differences are noted to be of secondary value in this context.",
