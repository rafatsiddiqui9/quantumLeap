Historical Background

The Oedipus myth has its roots in ancient Greek mythology, where it was first told in the 5th century BCE. The myth was likely influenced by earlier Mesopotamian and Egyptian myths, and it has since been retold and reinterpreted in many different forms of art and literature.

In ancient Greece, the Oedipus myth was seen as a way to explain the origins of the city of Thebes and the downfall of its rulers. The myth was also used to teach moral lessons and to explore the complexities of human nature.

The Oedipus problem has been studied and analyzed by scholars and literary critics for centuries, and it continues to be a popular topic of discussion and debate today.
