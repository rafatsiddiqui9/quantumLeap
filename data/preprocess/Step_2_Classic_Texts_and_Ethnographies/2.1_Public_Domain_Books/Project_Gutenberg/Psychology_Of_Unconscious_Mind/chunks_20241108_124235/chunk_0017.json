Burckhardt:\n\n  “Men draw thither to admire the heights of the mountains and the\n  powerful waves of the sea—and to turn away from themselves.”\n\nThe foremost authority on the Mithraic cult, Franz Cumont,[104] says as\nfollows:\n\n  “The gods were everywhere and mingled in all the events of daily life.\n  The fire which cooked the means of nourishment for the believers and\n  which warmed them; the water which quenched their thirst and cleansed\n  them; also the air which they breathed, and the day which shone for\n  them, were the objects of their homage. Perhaps no religion has given\n  to its adherents in so large a degree as Mithracism opportunity for\n  prayer and motive for devotion. When the initiated betook himself in\n  the evening to the sacred grotto concealed in the solitude of the\n  forest, at every step new sensations awakened in his heart some\n  mystical emotion. The stars that shone in the sky, the wind that\n  whispered in the foliage, the spring or brook which hastened murmuring\n  to the valley, even the earth which he trod under his feet, were in\n  his eyes divine; and all surrounding nature a worshipful fear of the\n  infinite forces that swayed the universe.”\n\nThese fundamental thoughts of Mithracism, which, like so much else of\nthe ancient spiritual life, arose again from their grave during the\nrenaissance are to be found in the beautiful words of Seneca:[105]\n\n  “When you enter a grove peopled with ancient trees, higher than the\n  ordinary, and whose boughs are so closely interwoven that the sky\n  cannot be seen, the stately shadows of the wood, the privacy of the\n  place, and the awful gloom cannot but strike you, as with the presence\n  of a deity, or when we see some cave at the foot of a mountain\n  penetrating the rocks, not made by human hands, but hollowed out to\n  great depths by nature; it fills the mind with a religious fear; we\n  venerate the fountain-heads of great rivers; the sudden eruption of a\n  vast body of water from the secret places of the earth, obtains an\n  altar: we adore likewise the springs of warm baths, and either the\n  opaque quality or immense depths, hath made some lakes sacred.”\n\nAll this disappeared in the transitory world of the Christian, only to\nbreak forth much later when the thought of mankind had achieved that\n_independence of the idea_ which could resist the æsthetic impression,\nso that thought was no longer fettered by the emotional effects of the\nimpression, but could rise to reflective observation. Thus man entered\ninto a new and independent relation to nature whereby the foundation was\nlaid for natural science and technique. With that, however, there\nentered in for the first time a displacement of the weight of interest;\nthere arose again real-transference which has reached its greatest\ndevelopment in our time. Materialistic interest has everywhere become\nparamount. Therefore, the realms of the spirit, where earlier the\ngreatest conflicts and developments took place, lie deserted and fallow;\nthe world has not only lost its God as the sentimentalists of the\nnineteenth century bewail, but also to some extent has lost its soul as\nwell. One, therefore, cannot wonder that the discoveries and doctrines\nof the Freudian school, with their wholly psychologic views, meet with\nan almost universal disapproval. Through the change of the centre of\ninterest from the inner to the outer world, the knowledge of nature has\nincreased enormously in comparison with that of earlier times. By this\nthe anthropomorphic conception of the religious dogmas has been\ndefinitely thrown open to question; therefore, the present-day religions\ncan only with the greatest difficulty close their eyes to this fact; for\nnot only has the intense interest been diverted from the Christian\nreligion, but criticism and the necessary correction have increased\ncorrespondingly. The Christian religion seems to have fulfilled its\ngreat biological purpose, in so far as we are able to judge. It has led\nhuman thought to independence, and has lost its significance, therefore,\nto a yet undetermined extent; in any case its dogmatic contents have\nbecome related to Mithracism. In consideration of the fact that this\nreligion has rendered, nevertheless, inconceivable service to education,\none cannot reject it “eo ipso” to-day. It seems to me that we might\nstill make use in some way of its form of thought, and especially of its\ngreat wisdom of life, which for two thousand years has been proven to be\nparticularly efficacious. The stumbling block is the _unhappy\ncombination of religion and morality_. That must be overcome. There\nstill remain traces of this strife in the soul, the lack of which in a\nhuman being is reluctantly felt. It is hard to say in what such things\nconsist; for this, ideas as well as words are lacking. If, in spite of\nthat, I attempt to say something about it, I do it parabolically, using\nSeneca’s words:[106]\n\n  “Nothing can be more commendable and beneficial if you persevere in\n  the pursuit of wisdom. It is what would be ridiculous to wish for when\n  it is in your power to attain it. There is no need to lift up your\n  hands to Heaven, or to pray the servant of the temple to admit you to\n  the ear of the idol that your prayers may be heard the better. God is\n  near thee; he is with thee. Yes, Lucilius, a holy spirit resides\n  within us, the observer of good and evil, and our constant guardian.\n  And as we treat him, he treats us; no good man is without a God. Could\n  any one ever rise above the power of fortune without his assistance?\n  It is he that inspires us with thoughts, upright, just and pure. We do\n  not, indeed, pretend to say what God; but that a God dwells in the\n  breast of every good man is certain.”\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER IV\n                          THE SONG OF THE MOTH\n\n\nA little later Miss Miller travelled from Geneva to Paris. She says:\n\n  “My weariness on the railway was so great that I could hardly sleep an\n  hour. It was terrifically hot in the ladies’ carriage.”\n\nAt four o’clock in the morning she noticed a moth that flew against the\nlight in her compartment. She then tried to go to sleep again. Suddenly\nthe following poem took possession of her mind.\n\n                       _The Moth to the Sun_\n\n       “I longed for thee when first I crawled to consciousness.\n       My dreams were all of thee when in the chrysalis I lay.\n       Oft myriads of my kind beat out their lives\n       Against some feeble spark once caught from thee.\n       And one hour more—and my poor life is gone;\n       Yet my last effort, as my first desire, shall be\n       But to approach thy glory; then, having gained\n       One raptured glance, I’ll die content.\n       For I, the source of beauty, warmth and life\n       Have in his perfect splendor once beheld.”\n\nBefore we go into the material which Miss Miller offers us for the\nunderstanding of the poem, we will again cast a glance over the\npsychologic situation in which the poem originated. Some months or weeks\nappear to have elapsed since the last direct manifestation of the\nunconscious that Miss Miller reported to us; about this period we have\nhad no information. We learn nothing about the moods and phantasies of\nthis time. If one might draw a conclusion from this silence it would be\npresumably that in the time which elapsed between the two poems, really\nnothing of importance had happened, and that, therefore, this poem is\nagain but a voiced fragment of the unconscious working of the complex\nstretching out over months and years. It is highly probable that it is\nconcerned with the same complex as before.[107] The earlier product, a\nhymn of creation full of hope, has, however, but little similarity to\nthe present poem. The poem lying before us has a truly hopeless,\nmelancholy character; moth and sun, two things which never meet. One\nmust in fairness ask, is a moth really expected to rise to the sun? We\nknow indeed the proverbial saying about the moth that flew into the\nlight and singed its wings, but not the legend of the moth that strove\ntowards the sun. Plainly, here, two things are connected in her thoughts\nthat do not belong together; first, the moth which fluttered around the\nlight so long that it burnt itself; and then, the idea of a small\nephemeral being, something like the day fly, which, in lamentable\ncontrast to the eternity of the stars, longs for an imperishable\ndaylight. This idea reminds one of Faust:\n\n       “Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight’s glow\n       The green-embosomed houses glitter;\n       The glow retreats, done is the day of toil,\n       It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;\n       Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil\n       Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!\n       Then would I see eternal Evening gild\n       The silent world beneath me glowing....\n       Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;\n       The new-born impulse fires my mind,—\n       I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,\n       The day before me and the night behind,\n       Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,—\n       A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.\n       Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid\n       Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.”\n\nNot long afterwards, Faust sees “the black dog roving there through\ncornfields and stubble,” the dog who is the same as the devil, the\ntempter, in whose hellish fires Faust has singed his wings. When he\nbelieved that he was expressing his great longing for the beauty of the\nsun and the earth, “he went astray thereover” and fell into the hands of\n“the Evil One.”\n\n            “Yes, resolute to reach some brighter distance,\n            On earth’s fair sun I turn my back.”\n\nThis is what Faust had said shortly before, in true recognition of the\nstate of affairs. The honoring of the beauty of nature led the Christian\nof the Middle Ages to pagan thoughts which lay in an antagonistic\nrelation to his conscious religion, just as once Mithracism was in\nthreatening competition with Christianity, for Satan often disguises\nhimself as an angel of light.[108]\n\nThe longing of Faust became his ruin. The longing for the Beyond had\nbrought as a consequence a loathing for life, and he stood on the brink\nof self-destruction.[109] The longing for the beauty of this world led\nhim anew to ruin, into doubt and pain, even to Marguerite’s tragic\ndeath. His mistake was that he followed after both worlds with no check\nto the driving force of his libido, like a man of violent passion. Faust\nportrays once more the folk-psychologic conflict of the beginning of the\nChristian era, but what is noteworthy, in a reversed order.\n\nAgainst what fearful powers of seduction Christ had to defend himself by\nmeans of his hope of the absolute world beyond, may be seen in the\nexample of Alypius in Augustine. If any of us had been living in that\nperiod of antiquity, he would have seen clearly that that culture must\ninevitably collapse because humanity revolted against it. It is well\nknown that even before the spread of Christianity a remarkable\nexpectation of redemption had taken possession of mankind. The following\neclogue of Virgil might well be a result of this mood:\n\n           “Ultima Cumæi venit jam carminis ætas;[110]\n           Magnus ab integro Sæclorum nascitur ordo,\n           Jam redit et Virgo,[111] redeunt Saturnia regna;\n           Jam nova progenies cælo demittitur alto.\n           Tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum\n           Desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,\n           Casta fave Lucina: tuus jam regnat Apollo.\n\n           “Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,\n           Inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.\n           Ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit\n           Permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis,\n           Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.”[112]\n\nThe turning to asceticism resulting from the general expansion of\nChristianity brought about a new misfortune to many: monasticism and the\nlife of the anchorite.[113]",
