    "paragraph": "The infantile scene cannot carry through its revival; it must be satisfied with its return as a dream. From this conception of the historical side of regression, it follows consequently that the modes of conclusion of the dream, in so far as one may speak of them, must show at the same time an analogous and infantile character. This is truly the case, as experience has abundantly shown, so that to-day every one who is familiar with the subject of dream analysis confirms Freud\u2019s proposition that _dreams are a piece of the conquered life of the childish soul_. Inasmuch as the childish psychic life is undeniably of an archaic type, this characteristic belongs to the dream in quite an unusual degree. Freud calls our attention to this especially.\u201cThe dream, which fulfils its wishes by a short, regressive path,  affords us only an example of the primary method of working of the  psychic apparatus, which has been abandoned by us as unsuitable. That  which once ruled in the waking state, when the psychical life was  still young and impotent, appears to be banished to the dream life, in  somewhat the same way as the bow and arrow, those discarded, primitive  weapons of adult humanity, have been relegated to the nursery.\u201d[32]",

    "question": "What analogy does the author use to describe the function of the dream in relation to the psychic apparatus?\n\n**ANSWERS:**\nThe author uses the analogy of the \"short, regressive path\" of dreams to illustrate that dreams provide a regressive method of fulfilling wishes. This is analogous to the primary method of working of the psychic apparatus, which was abandoned as unsuitable because it reflects the young and impotent state of psychical life in the waking state.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the author compare the dream life to the waking life in terms of psychological development?",
    "answer": "The author compares the dream life to the waking life by stating that what once ruled in the waking state, when the psychical life was still young and impotent, is now relegated to the dream life, much like the bow and arrow, discarded primitive weapons of adult humanity, are relegated to the nursery.",
