    "paragraph": "We have already seen that the incest prohibition prevents the son from reproducing himself through the mother. But this must be done by the god, as is shown with remarkable clearness and candor in the pious Egyptian mythology, which has preserved the most ancient and simple concepts. Thus Chnum, the \u201cmoulder,\u201d the \u201cpotter,\u201d the \u201carchitect,\u201d moulds his egg upon the potter\u2019s wheel, for he is \u201cthe immortal growth,\u201d \u201cthe reproduction of himself and his own rebirth, the creator of the egg, which emerged from the primitive waters.\u201d In the Book of the Dead it says:\u201cI am the sublime falcon (the Sun-god), which has come forth from his  egg.\u201dAnother passage in the Book of the Dead reads:\u201cI am the creator of Nun, who has taken his place in the underworld.  My nest is not seen and my egg is not broken.\u201dA further passage reads:\u201cthat great and noble god in his egg: who is his own originator of  that which has arisen from him.\u201d[532]Therefore, the god Nagaga-uer is also called the \u201cgreat cackler.\u201d (Book of the Dead.) \u201cI cackle like a goose and I whistle like a falcon.\u201d The mother is reproached with the incest prohibition as an act of wilful maliciousness by which she excludes the son from immortality. Therefore, a god must at least rebel, overpower and chastise the mother. (Compare Adam and Lilith, above.) The \u201coverpowering\u201d signifies incestuous rape.[533] Herodotus[534] has preserved for us a valuable fragment of this religious phantasy.\u201cAnd how they celebrate their feast to Isis in the city of Busiris, I  have already previously remarked. After the sacrifice, all of them,  men and women, full ten thousand people, begin to beat each other. But  it would be sin for me to mention for whom they do beat each other.",

    "question": "How does the excerpt from Herodotus suggest the way in which this religious phantasy is celebrated, and what does it imply about the societal norms and practices?",
    "answer": "Herodotus describes a ritual in the city of Busiris where men and women beat each other, though the specific target of this beating is not mentioned. This suggests a celebration that involves communal and likely ritualistic violence, reflecting the societal norms and practices that include the resolution of conflicts through such acts, possibly related to the religious phantasy of overcoming the incest prohibition.",
