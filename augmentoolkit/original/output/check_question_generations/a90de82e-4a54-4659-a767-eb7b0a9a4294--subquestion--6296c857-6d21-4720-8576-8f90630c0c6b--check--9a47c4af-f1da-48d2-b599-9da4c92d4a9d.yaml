    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\
