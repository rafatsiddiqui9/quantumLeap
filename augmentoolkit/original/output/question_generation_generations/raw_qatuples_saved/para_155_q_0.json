    "paragraph": "\u201cHe divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he  smiteth through the proud.\u201cBy his spirit he hath garnished the heavens, his hand hath formed the  crooked serpent.\u201dGunkel places Rahab as identical with Chaos, that is, the same as Ti\u00e2mat. Gunkel translates \u201cthe breaking to pieces\u201d as \u201cviolation.\u201d Ti\u00e2mat or Rahab as the mother is also the whore. Gilgamesh treats Ishtar in this way when he accuses her of whoredom. This insult towards the mother is very familiar to us from dream analysis. The dragon Rahab appears also as Leviathan, the water monster (maternal sea)._Psalm_ lxxiv:(13) \u201cThou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the  heads of the dragons in the waters.(14) \u201cThou brakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces and gavest him to  be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.(15) \u201cThou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou didst dry up  mighty rivers.\u201dWhile only the phallic meaning of the Leviathan was emphasized in the first part of this work, we now discover also the maternal meaning. A further parallel is:_Isaiah_ xxvii:1:\u201cIn that day, the Lord with his cruel and great and strong sword shall  punish Leviathan, the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked  serpent, and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.\u201dWe come upon a special motive in Job, chap. xli, v. 1:\u201cCanst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord  which thou lettest down? Canst thou put an hook in his nose? or bore  his jaw through with a thorn?\u201dNumerous parallels to this motive are to be found among exotic myths in Frobenius, where the maternal sea monster was also fished for. The comparison of the mother libido with the elementary powers of the sea and the powerful monsters borne by the earth show how invincibly great is the power of that libido which we designate as maternal.",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the interpretation of Rahab and Ti\u00e2mat in ancient mythology?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that Rahab and Ti\u00e2mat are interpreted as identical, both representing Chaos or the same entity. Gunkel, the scholar mentioned, translates \"the breaking to pieces\" as \"violation.\" Additionally, both Rahab and Ti\u00e2mat are described as the mother and the whore, suggesting a complex symbol representing maternal power and seduction.",
