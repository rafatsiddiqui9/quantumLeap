    "paragraph": "All this experience suggests to us that we draw a parallel between the phantastical, mythological thinking of antiquity and the similar thinking of children, between the lower human races and dreams.[33] This train of thought is not a strange one for us, but quite familiar through our knowledge of comparative anatomy and the history of development, which show us how the structure and function of the human body are the results of a series of embryonic changes which correspond to similar changes in the history of the race. Therefore, the supposition is justified that ontogenesis corresponds in psychology to phylogenesis. Consequently, it would be true, as well, that the state of infantile thinking in the child\u2019s psychic life, as well as in dreams, is nothing but a re-echo of the prehistoric and the ancient.[34]In regard to this, Nietzsche takes a very broad and remarkable standpoint.[35]",

    "question": "What is the relationship between ontogenesis and phylogenesis according to the text?\n\n**ANS:** \nAccording to the text, ontogenesis (the development of an individual organism from birth to maturity) is considered to correspond to phylogenesis (the evolutionary development of a species) in psychology. This means that the state of infantile thinking in a child's psychic life is a re-echo of the prehistoric and ancient forms of thinking, indicating a continuity between individual development and the evolution of human thought.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the text describe Nietzsche's perspective on this topic?",
    "answer": "The text describes Nietzsche's perspective as broad and remarkable, suggesting that he takes a comprehensive view of the relationship between individual psychological development and the broader historical and evolutionary context of human thought.",
