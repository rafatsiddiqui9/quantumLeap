    "paragraph": "\u201cFrom the age of nine to sixteen, I went every Sunday to a  Presbyterian Church, in charge of which, at that time, was a very  cultured minister. In one of the earliest memories which I have  retained of him, I see myself as a very small girl sitting in a very  large pew, continually endeavoring to keep myself awake and pay  attention, without in the least being able to understand what he meant  when he spoke to us of Chaos, Cosmos and the Gift of Love (don  d\u2019amour).\u201dThere are also rather early memories of the awakening of puberty (nine to sixteen) which have connected the idea of the cosmos springing from chaos with the \u201cdon d\u2019amour.\u201d The medium in which these associations occur is the memory of a certain very much honored ecclesiastic who spoke those dark words. From the same period of time comes the remembrance of that excitement about the idea of the \u201ccreative thought\u201d which from itself \u201cproduced its object.\u201d Here are two ways of creation intimated: the creative thought, and the mysterious reference to the \u201cdon d\u2019amour.\u201d",

    "question": "What other ways of creation does the author mention from this period, and how are they described?",
    "answer": "The author mentions two ways of creation: the creative thought and the mysterious reference to the \"don d'amour.\" The creative thought is described as a \"creative thought\" that \"produces its object\" from itself. The \"don d'amour\" is mentioned as a mysterious reference that also plays a role in creation during this period.",
