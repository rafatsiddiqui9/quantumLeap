    "paragraph": "With this we affirm the important fact that man in his phantastic thinking has kept a condensation of the psychic history of his development. An extraordinarily important task, which even to-day is hardly possible, is to give a systematic description of phantastic thinking. One may, at the most, sketch it. While directed thinking is a phenomenon conscious throughout,[49] the same cannot be asserted of phantastic thinking. Doubtless, a great part of it still falls entirely in the realm of the conscious, but, at least, just as much goes along in half shadows, and generally an undetermined amount in the unconscious; and this can, therefore, be disclosed only indirectly.[50] By means of phantastic thinking, directed thinking is connected with the oldest foundations of the human mind, which have been for a long time beneath the threshold of the consciousness. The products of this phantastic thinking arising directly from the consciousness are, first, waking dreams, or day-dreams, to which Freud, Flournoy, Pick and others have given special attention; then the dreams which offer to the consciousness, at first, a mysterious exterior, and win meaning only through the indirectly inferred unconscious contents. Lastly, there is a so-called wholly unconscious phantasy system in the split-off complex, which exhibits a pronounced tendency towards the production of a dissociated personality.[51]",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about phantastic thinking and its relation to the development of the human mind?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that phantastic thinking is a significant aspect of the human mind that condenses the psychic history of development. While directed thinking is conscious throughout, phantastic thinking is not always fully conscious. A significant part of it remains in the realm of the conscious, but a considerable amount also operates in the unconscious or in half-shadows. Consequently, phantastic thinking connects directed thinking with the foundational aspects of the human mind that have long been below the threshold of consciousness.",
