    "paragraph": "\u201cNit, the ancient, the mother who bore the light god, R\u00e2, who bore  first of all, when there was nothing which brought forth.\u201cThe cow, the ancient, which bore the sun, and then laid the germ of  gods and men.\u201dThe word \u201cnun\u201d has the significance of young, fresh, new, also the on-coming waters of the Nile flood. In a transferred sense \u201cnun\u201d was also used for the chaotic primitive waters; in general for the primitive generating matter[488] which was personified by the goddess Nunet. From her Nut sprang, the goddess of heaven, who was represented with a starry body, and also as the heavenly cow with a starry body.When the sun-god, little by little, retires on the back of the heavenly cow, just as poor Lazarus returns into Abraham\u2019s bosom, each has the same significance; they return into the mother, in order to rise as Horus. Thus it can be said that in the morning the goddess is the mother, at noon the sister-wife and in the evening again the mother, who receives the dying in her lap, reminding us of the Piet\u00e0 of Michelangelo. As shown by the illustration (from Dideron\u2019s \u201cIconographie Chr\u00e9tienne\u201d), this thought has been transferred as a whole into Christianity.Thus the fate of Osiris is explained: he passes into the mother\u2019s womb, the chest, the sea, the tree, the column of Astartes; he is dismembered, re-formed, and reappears again in his son, Hor-pi-chrud.",
