Give me your hand.BRUTUS: And my heart too.CASSIUS:         O Brutus!BRUTUS:               What\u2019s the matter?CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me        When that rash humor _which my mother gave me_        Makes me forgetful?BRUTUS:           Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth        When you are over earnest with your Brutus,        He\u2019ll think your mother chides and leave you so.",

    "question": "How does Cassius describe his relationship with Brutus, and what does this reveal about their dynamics?",
    "answer": "Cassius describes his relationship with Brutus as one where Brutus easily gets angry and quickly cools down, much like a lamb that shows a spark of anger but then becomes calm again. Cassius suggests that Brutus's mood swings can be abrupt and intense, which Cassius is willing to endure because of his love for Brutus.",
