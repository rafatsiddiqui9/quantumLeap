    "paragraph": "This proud sentence, which naturally only a woman can express, because man is not accustomed to boast in that direction, again confirms the fact that all enterprises have remained but dreams, that the body has remained \u201cinviolate.\u201d When the hero visits the heroine in a dream, it is clear what is meant.
