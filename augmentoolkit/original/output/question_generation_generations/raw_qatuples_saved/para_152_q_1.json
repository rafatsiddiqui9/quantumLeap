    "paragraph": " It is evident that in this early infantile activity the preliminary stage of the later trouble may be found. The especially remarkable features in this case are, first, that the child did not carry out the action on its own body, and, secondly, the assiduity with which it carried on the action.[281] One is tempted to bring these two facts into a causal relationship and to say, because the child does not accomplish this action on her own body, perhaps that is the reason of the assiduity, for by boring into the wall she never arrives at the same satisfaction as if she executed the activity onanistically on her own body.",

    "question": "How does the assiduity of the child's behavior relate to the action being performed on the wall rather than on the body?",
    "answer": "The assiduity with which the child performed the action on the wall may be linked to the fact that the child did not carry out the action on its own body. The child might be doing this because the action on the wall does not provide the same satisfaction or gratification as performing similar actions on its own body would.",
