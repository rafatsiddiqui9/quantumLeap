    "paragraph": "As we learn through Freud, the dream shows a similar type. Since the dream is unconcerned with the real condition of things, it brings the most heterogeneous matter together, and a world of impossibilities takes the place of realities. Freud finds progression characteristic of thinking when awake; that is to say, the advancement of the thought excitation from the system of the inner or outer perception through the \u201cendopsychic\u201d work of association, conscious and unconscious, to the motor end; that is to say, towards innervation. In the dream he finds the reverse, namely, regression of the thought excitation from the preconscious or unconscious to the system of perception, by the means of which the dream receives its ordinary impression of sensuous distinctness, which can rise to an almost hallucinating clearness. The dream thinking moves in a retrograde manner towards the raw material of memory. \u201cThe structure of the dream thoughts is dissolved during the progress of regression into its raw material.\u201d The reanimation of the original perception is, however, only one side of regression. The other side is regression to the infantile memory material, which might also be understood as regression to the original perception, but which deserves especial mention on account of its independent importance. This regression might, indeed, be considered as \u201chistorical.\u201d The dream, according to this conception, might also be described as _the substitute of the infantile scene, changed through transference into the recent scene_.",

    "question": "What does Freud mean by \"the substitute of the infantile scene, changed through transference into the recent scene\" in the context of dreams?",
    "answer": "Freud means that dreams represent infantile scenes from early memories, but these scenes are transformed or \"transferred\" into the context of recent experiences or scenes. This transformation allows the dream to incorporate elements from both past and present, providing a psychological connection between the two.",
