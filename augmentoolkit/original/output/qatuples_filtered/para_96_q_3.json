    "paragraph": " The chthonic god was probably always a serpent dwelling in a cave, and was fed with \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af.[741] In the Asclepiadean of the later period, the sacred serpents were scarcely visible, meaning that they probably existed only figuratively.[742] Nothing was left but the hole in which the snake was said to dwell. There the \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af[743] were placed; later the obolus was thrown in. The sacred cavern in the temple of Kos consisted of a rectangular pit, upon which was laid a stone lid, with a square hole; this arrangement serves the purpose of a treasure house. The snake hole had become a slit for money, a \u201csacrificial box,\u201d and the cave had become a \u201ctreasure.\u201d That this development, which Herzog traces, agrees excellently with the actual condition is shown by a discovery in the temple of Asclepius and Hygieia in Ptolemais:",
