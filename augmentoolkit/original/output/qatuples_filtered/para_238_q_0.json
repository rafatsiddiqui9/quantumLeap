    "paragraph": "\u201cOut on the open ocean speeds my dreaming:    The glassy flood before my feet is gleaming,    A new day beckons to a newer shore!    A fiery chariot borne on buoyant pinions,    Sweeps near me now! I soon shall ready be    To pierce the ether\u2019s high, unknown dominions,    To reach new spheres of pure activity!    This Godlike rapture, this supreme existence....\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7\u201cYes, let me dare those gates to fling asunder,    Which every man would fain go slinking by!    \u2019Tis time, through deeds this word of truth to thunder;    That with the height of God\u2019s Man\u2019s dignity may vie!    Nor from that gloomy gulf to shrink affrighted,    Where fancy doth herself to self-born pangs compel,\u2014    To struggle toward that pass benighted,    Around whose narrow mouth flame all the fires of Hell:\u2014    To take this step with cheerful resolution,    Though Nothingness should be the certain swift conclusion!\u201dIt sounds like a confirmation, when the succeeding vision of Miss Miller\u2019s is _une falaise \u00e0 pic_, \u201ca steep, precipitous cliff.\u201d (Compare _gouffre_.) The entire series of individual visions is completed, as the author observes, by a confusion of sounds, somewhat resembling \u201cwa-ma, wa-ma.\u201d This has a very primitive, barbaric sound. Since we learn from the author nothing of the subjective roots of this sound, nothing is left us but the suspicion that this sound might be considered, taken in connection with the whole, as a slight mutilation of the well-known call ma-ma.CHAPTER VI        THE BATTLE FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE MOTHERThere now comes a pause in the production of visions by Miss Miller; then the activity of the unconscious is resumed very energetically.A forest with trees and bushes appears.",
