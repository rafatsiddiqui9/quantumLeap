Can you explain what the final states of adaptation described in the text are? Specifically, what does it mean to have a stuporose or catatonic automaton?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! In the context of dementia præcox and Freud's theories, the final states of adaptation described include stuporose and catatonic automatons. These states indicate a complete loss of normal functioning. A stuporose automaton appears to be in a daze, appearing almost like a living statue, while a catatonic automaton is rigidly immobile. In both cases, the patient seems to have lost their ability to interact with the real world normally.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these states or dementia præcox in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a lot. Moving on, Freud talks about the state of reality in many cases of dementia præcox. Could you explain more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure! According to Freud, in many cases of dementia præcox, the state of reality disappears entirely. This means that there is no trace of psychological adaptation or orientation. Reality is repressed, and the patient’s perceptions and thoughts are dominated by the contents of a complex, often delusional or hallucinatory.\n\nDoes that clarify things a bit more? Do you have any other questions about Freud's descriptions of dementia præcox?\n\n**User:**\nYes, I’m curious about the \"longing for reality\" mentioned in relation to patients with paranoic dementia and dementia præcox. Can you explain what Freud suggests about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Freud suggests that the \"longing for reality\" in patients with paranoic dementia and dementia præcox is not just due to the withdrawal of \"libidinous affluxes.\" Instead, it is also related to a general interest in reality, which Freud calls the \"objective interest.\" This interest in reality seems to be crucial for maintaining psychological adaptation and orientation. Even in cases where the patient exhibits delusional thinking, there is often a residual interest in reality that helps to preserve some connection to the external world.\n\nDoes that help to clarify Freud's perspective on the \"longing for reality\"? Do you have any more questions on this topic?\n\n**User:**\nOne more thing, Freud mentions \"the whole adaptation to reality has ceased.\" Could you explain what that means?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! When Freud says \"the whole adaptation to reality has ceased,\" he means that the patient has lost all their ability to adapt to and engage with the real world. This involves both the erotic interest and the general interest in reality. When both of these interests disappear, the patient is no longer able to orient themselves in the real world, leading to a state where they are completely disconnected from reality.\n\nDoes this make sense to you? Do you have any other questions about Freud's work on dementia præcox?"}
