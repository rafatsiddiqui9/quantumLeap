    "question": "What does Cassius mean when he says, \"rash humor which my mother gave me\"?\n\n**ANS:** Cassius means that his quick temper or impulsive behavior is a trait he inherited from his mother, suggesting that this is an inherent part of his character that is hard to control.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat assurance does Brutus offer to Cassius about his behavior in the future?",
    "answer": "Brutus assures Cassius that in the future, when Cassius is overly serious or concerned, he, Brutus, will think that Cassius's mother is scolding him and will then leave Cassius alone. This shows a mutual understanding and attempt to ease tensions.",
