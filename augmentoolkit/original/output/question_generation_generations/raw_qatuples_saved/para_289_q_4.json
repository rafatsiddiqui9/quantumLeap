    "paragraph": "\u201cHe who, sacrificing, entered into all these beings      As a wise sacrificer, our Father, who,      Striving for blessings through prayer,      Hiding his origin,      Entered this lowly world,      What and who has served him      As a resting-place and a support?\u201d[810]Rigveda 10: 90, gives answer to these questions. Purusha is the primal being who\u201c... covered earth on every side and          Spread ten fingers\u2019 breadth beyond.\u201dOne sees that Purusha is a sort of Platonic world soul, who surrounds the world from without. Of Purusha it is said:\u201cBeing born he overtopped the earth          Before, behind, and in all places.\u201dThe mother symbolism is plain, it seems to me, in the idea of Purusha. He represents the mother-imago and the libido of the child clinging to her. From this assumption all that follows is very easily explained:\u201cAs sacrificial animal on the bed of straw        Was dedicated the Purusha,        Who was born on the straw,        Whom the Gods, the Blest, and the Wise,        Meeting there, sacrificed.\u201dThis verse is very remarkable; if one wishes to stretch this mythology out on the procrustean bed of logic, sore violence would have to be committed. It is an incredibly phantastic conception that, beside the gods, ordinary \u201cwise men\u201d unite in sacrificing the primitive being, aside from the circumstance that, beside the primitive being, nothing had existed in the beginning (that is to say, before the sacrifice), as we shall soon see. If the great mystery of the mother sacrifice is meant thereby, then all becomes clear:",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the initial state of the world before the sacrifice of Purusha?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that before the sacrifice of Purusha, nothing else existed in the beginning, meaning that the world was in a state of primordial simplicity. The sacrifice of Purusha is seen as the first and most fundamental act that brought order and complexity to the world, establishing the gods, the wise men, and the structure of the universe.",
