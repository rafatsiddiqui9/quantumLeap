    "paragraph": "This condition to be sure is not a recognized or a conscious one, for the individual may think himself perfectly free from this past influence because he is living in the real world, and because actually there is a great difference between the present conditions and that of his childish past. He sees all this, intellectually, but there is a wide gap between the intellectual grasp of a situation and the emotional development, and it is the latter realm wherein lies the disharmony. However, although many ideas and feelings are connected with the parents, analysis reveals very often that they are only subjective and that in reality they bear little resemblance to the actual past situation. Therefore, Jung speaks no longer of the real father and mother but uses the term imago or image to represent the father or mother, because the feelings and phantasies frequently do not deal with the real parents but with the distorted and subjective image created by the imagination of the individual.Following this distinction Jung sees in the Oedipus complex of Freud only a symbol for the \u201cchildish desire towards the parents and for the conflict which this craving evokes,\u201d and cannot accept the theory that in this early stage of childhood the mother has any real sexual significance for the child.",

    "question": "Why does Jung use the term \"imago\" instead of \"real parents\" when discussing feelings and phantasies about parents?",
    "answer": "Jung uses the term \"imago\" instead of \"real parents\" because the feelings and phantasies about parents are often subjective and distorted. These perceptions are created by the individual's imagination and may not bear much resemblance to the actual past situation. Thus, \"imago\" better represents these subjective and often misconstrued images of the parents.",
