    "paragraph": "Amenhotep IV by his reform completed a work which is psychologically important. He united all the bull,[147] ram,[148] crocodile[149] and pile-dwelling[150] gods into the disc of the sun, and made it clear that their various attributes were compatible with the sun\u2019s attributes.[151] A similar fate overtook the Hellenic and Roman polytheism through the syncretistic efforts of later centuries. The beautiful prayer of Lucius[152] to the queen of the Heavens furnishes an important proof of this:\u201cQueen of Heaven, whether thou art the genial Ceres, the prime parent  of fruits;\u2014or whether thou art celestial Venus;\u2014or whether thou art  the sister of Ph\u0153bus;\u2014or whether thou art Proserpina, terrific with  midnight howlings\u2014with that feminine brightness of thine illuminating  the walls of every city.\u201d[153]",

    "question": "What does the example of Lucius's prayer suggest about the polytheistic beliefs in the Hellenic and Roman times?",
    "answer": "Lucius's prayer suggests that in Hellenic and Roman times, polytheism allowed for the belief that a single deity could embody the attributes of multiple gods. This flexibility in worship and the ability to see the same divinity in different forms and contexts indicate a syncretistic approach to polytheism, where deities could be amalgamated and their attributes interchanged.",
