  "original_text": "The serpent as an instrument of sacrifice has already been abundantly\nillustrated. (Legend of St. Silvester, trial of the virgins, wounding of\nRê and Philoctetes, symbolism of the lance and arrow.) It is the\ndestroying knife; but, according to the principle of the “Occide\nmoriturus” also the phallus, the sacrificial act represents a coitus act\nas well.[848] The religious significance of the serpent as a\ncave-dwelling, chthonic animal points to a further thought; namely, to\nthe creeping into the mother’s womb in the form of a serpent.[849] As\nthe horse is the brother, so the serpent is the sister of Chiwantopel.\nThis close relation refers to a fellowship of these animals and their\ncharacters with the hero. We know of the horse that, as a rule, he is\nnot an animal of fear, although, mythologically, he has at times this\nmeaning. He signifies much more the living, positive part of the libido,\nthe striving towards continual renewal, whereas the serpent, as a rule,\nrepresents the fear, the fear of death,[850] and is thought of as the\nantithesis to the phallus. This antithesis between horse and serpent,\nmythologically between bull and serpent, represents an opposition of the\nlibido within itself, a striving forwards and a striving backwards at\none and the same time.[851] It is not only as if the libido might be an\nirresistible striving forward, an endless life and will for\nconstruction, such as Schopenhauer has formulated in his world will,\ndeath and every end being some malignancy or fatality coming from\nwithout, but the libido, corresponding to the sun, also wills the\ndestruction of its creation. In the first half of life its will is for\ngrowth, in the second half of life it hints, softly at first, and then\naudibly, at its will for death. And just as in youth the impulse to\nunlimited growth often lies under the enveloping covering of a\nresistance against life, so also does the will of the old to die\nfrequently lie under the covering of a stubborn resistance against the\nend.\n\n[Illustration: PRIAPUS AND SERPENT]\n\nThis apparent contrast in the nature of the libido is strikingly\nillustrated by a Priapic statuette in the antique collection at\nVerona.[852] Priapus smilingly points with his finger to a snake biting\noff his “membrum.” He carries a basket on his arm, filled with oblong\nobjects, probably phalli, evidently prepared as substitutes.\n\nA similar motive is found in the “Deluge” of Rubens (in the Munich Art\nGallery), where a serpent emasculates a man. This motive explains the\nmeaning of the “Deluge”; the maternal sea is also the devouring\nmother.[853] The phantasy of the world conflagration, of the cataclysmic\nend of the world in general, is nothing but a mythological projection of\na personal individual will for death; therefore, Rubens could represent\nthe essence of the “Deluge” phantasy in the emasculation by the serpent;\nfor the serpent is our own repressed will for the end, for which we find\nan explanation only with the greatest difficulty.\n\nConcerning the symbolism of the serpent in general, its significance is\nvery dependent upon the time of life and circumstances. The repressed\nsexuality of youth is symbolized by the serpent, because the arrival of\nsexuality puts an end to childhood. To age, on the contrary, the serpent\nsignifies the repressed thought of death. With our author it is the\ninsufficiently expressed sexuality which as serpent assumes the rôle of\nsacrificer and delivers the hero over to death and rebirth.\n\nAs in the beginning of our investigation the hero’s name forced us to\nspeak of the symbolism of Popocatepetl as belonging to the creating part\nof the human body, so at the end does the Miller drama again give us an\nopportunity of seeing how the volcano assists in the death of the hero\nand causes him to disappear by means of an earthquake into the depths of\nthe earth. As the volcano gave birth and name to the hero, so at the end\nof the day it devours him again.[854] We learn from the last words of\nthe hero that _his longed-for beloved_, she who alone understands him,\nis called Ja-ni-wa-ma. We find in this name those lisped syllables\nfamiliar to us from the early childhood of the hero, Hiawatha, Wawa,\nwama, mama. The only one who really understands us is the mother. For\n_verstehen_, “to understand” (Old High German _firstân_), is probably\nderived from a primitive Germanic prefix _fri_, identical with περὶ,\nmeaning “roundabout.” The Old High German _antfristôn_, “to interpret,”\nis considered as identical with _firstân_. From that results a\nfundamental significance of the verb _verstehen_, “to understand,” as\n“standing round about something.”[855] _Comprehendere_ and\nκατασυλλαμβάνειν express a similar idea as the German _erfassen_, “to\ngrasp, to comprehend.” The thing common to these expressions is the\nsurrounding, the enfolding. And there is no doubt that there is nothing\nin the world which so completely enfolds us as the mother. When the\nneurotic complains that the world has no understanding, he says\nindirectly that he misses the mother. Paul Verlaine has expressed this\nthought most beautifully in his poem, “Mon Rêve Familier”:\n\n                         _My Familiar Dream._\n\n         “Often I have that strange and poignant dream\n           Of some unknown who meets my flame with flame—\n           Who, with each time, is never quite the same,\n         Yet never wholly different does she seem.\n         She understands me! Every fitful gleam\n           Troubling my heart, she reads aright somehow:\n           Even the sweat upon my pallid brow\n         She soothes with tears, a cool and freshening stream.\n\n         “If she is dark or fair? I do not know—\n         Her name? Only that it is sweet and low,\n           Like those of loved ones who have long since died.\n         Her look is like a statue’s, kind and clear;\n           And her calm voice, distant and dignified,\n         Like those hushed voices that I loved to hear.”\n\n",
