    "paragraph": "theoretically, from the standpoint of the Freudian theory of libido. If Abraham believes that through the withdrawal of the libido from the outer world the paranoid system or the schizophrenic symptomatology results, then this assumption is not justified from the standpoint of the knowledge of that time, because a mere libido introversion and regression leads, speedily, as Freud has clearly shown, into the neuroses, and, strictly speaking, into the transference neuroses, and not into dementia pr\u00e6cox. Therefore, the transference of the libido theory to dementia pr\u00e6cox is impossible, because this illness produces a loss of reality which cannot be explained by the deficiency of the libido defined in this narrow sense.",

    "answer": "The primary reason given in the text for why the libido theory cannot be applied to dementia pr\u00e6cox is that this illness involves a loss of reality. This loss of reality cannot be explained by the simple deficiency of libido as defined in a narrow sense. Therefore, the theory of libido introversion and regression does not adequately address the severe cognitive and perceptual disturbances associated with dementia pr\u00e6cox.",
