    "paragraph": "The longing of Faust became his ruin. The longing for the Beyond had brought as a consequence a loathing for life, and he stood on the brink of self-destruction.[109] The longing for the beauty of this world led him anew to ruin, into doubt and pain, even to Marguerite\u2019s tragic death. His mistake was that he followed after both worlds with no check to the driving force of his libido, like a man of violent passion. Faust portrays once more the folk-psychologic conflict of the beginning of the Christian era, but what is noteworthy, in a reversed order.Against what fearful powers of seduction Christ had to defend himself by means of his hope of the absolute world beyond, may be seen in the example of Alypius in Augustine. If any of us had been living in that period of antiquity, he would have seen clearly that that culture must inevitably collapse because humanity revolted against it. It is well known that even before the spread of Christianity a remarkable expectation of redemption had taken possession of mankind. The following eclogue of Virgil might well be a result of this mood:\u201cUltima Cum\u00e6i venit jam carminis \u00e6tas;[110]      Magnus ab integro S\u00e6clorum nascitur ordo,      Jam redit et Virgo,[111] redeunt Saturnia regna;      Jam nova progenies c\u00e6lo demittitur alto.      Tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum      Desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,      Casta fave Lucina: tuus jam regnat Apollo.\u201cTe duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,      Inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.      Ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit      Permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis,      Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.\u201d[112]The turning to asceticism resulting from the general expansion of Christianity brought about a new misfortune to many: monasticism and the life of the anchorite.[113]",
