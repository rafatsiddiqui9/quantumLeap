The author proposes that passion must be exterminated. Can you explain why the author thinks passion is so dangerous?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The author proposes that passion must be exterminated because it threatens the power of good and reason. The basis for this proposal is rooted in the idea that passion, if left unchecked, will lead to chaos and destruction. This is illustrated through the myth of the deluge, where passionate forces can break through all barriers and engulf everything. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this concept, or would you like to explore another aspect of the author's work?\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite intriguing. In the context of Indian mythology, how is passion described, and what does it symbolize?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! In Indian mythology, passion is described as a chaotic primitive force that breaks through all barriers. It symbolizes the sea and the waters of the deep, as well as the floods of rain, which are fructifying and generating waters. These waters surge over the mountain tops and engulf all living things, illustrating how passion can lead to destruction. This mythological description helps to explain the author's view on the destructive potential of unchecked passion. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?\n\n**User:**\nI understand the mythological perspective. Now, according to Freud, what does the relationship between libido and God suggest, and what are the consequences of its destruction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFreud sees the libido as a complex force that can be both God and the Devil. When the sinfulness of the libido is destroyed, it results in the loss of a significant part of the libido itself. This destruction also leads to a loss for God, somewhat like an amputation. The loss of the Devil (a part of the libido) results in a loss for God as well. This suggests a delicate balance between these forces. Is there any other aspect of Freud's theory you're curious about?\n\n**User:**\nThat’s fascinating. The author suggests translating a mythological concept into a psychological one. Could you explain what mythological concept is being translated and what the psychological interpretation implies, based on [Freud's] [The Interpretation of Dreams]?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The author suggests translating the mythological concept of a second fall of angels threatening heaven into a psychological one. In Freud's [The Interpretation of Dreams], the psychological interpretation implies that the power of good and reason, which rules the world wisely, is threatened by chaotic primitive power. This primitive power must be controlled or eliminated to maintain the order and stability of the world. The mythological concept of the fall of angels is seen as a metaphor for the internal struggles and the need for psychological control. Does this help clarify the connection between the mythological and psychological interpretations?"}
