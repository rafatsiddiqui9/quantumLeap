Give me your hand.BRUTUS: And my heart too.CASSIUS:         O Brutus!BRUTUS:               What\u2019s the matter?CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me        When that rash humor _which my mother gave me_        Makes me forgetful?BRUTUS:           Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth        When you are over earnest with your Brutus,        He\u2019ll think your mother chides and leave you so.",

    "question": "What specific example does Cassius give to explain his tendency to be over-earnest with Brutus?",
    "answer": "Cassius gives the example of his childhood, specifically mentioning that he has always been prone to \"rash humor which my mother gave me,\" which makes him act impulsively and forcefully. He suggests that this trait has sometimes made Brutus feel that he is being treated with less consideration than he deserves.",
