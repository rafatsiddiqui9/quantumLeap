This element also lies in the\ntree, even in the family tree, as is distinctly shown by the mediæval\nfamily trees. From the first ancestor there grows upward, in the place\nof the “membrum virile,” the trunk of the great tree. The bisexual\nsymbolic character of the tree is intimated by the fact that in Latin\ntrees have a masculine termination and a feminine gender.[450] The\nfeminine (especially the maternal) meaning of the forest and the phallic\nsignificance of trees in dreams is well known. I mention an example.\n\nIt concerns a woman who had always been nervous, and who, after many\nyears of marriage, became ill as a result of the typical retention of\nthe libido. She had the following dream after she had learned to know a\nyoung man of many engaging free opinions who was very pleasing to her:\nShe found herself in a garden where stood a remarkable exotic tree with\nstrange red fleshy flowers or fruits. She picked them and ate them.\nThen, to her horror, she felt that she was poisoned. This dream idea may\neasily be understood by means of the antique or poetic symbolism, so I\ncan spare information as to the analytic material.\n\nThe double significance of the tree is readily explained by the fact\nthat such symbols are not to be understood “anatomically” but\npsychologically as libido symbols; therefore, it is not permissible to\ninterpret the tree on account of its similar form as directly phallic;\nit can also be called a woman or the uterus of the mother. The\nuniformity of the significance lies alone in the similarity to the\nlibido.[451] One loses one’s way in one “cul de sac” after another by\nsaying that this is the symbol substituted for the mother and that for\nthe penis. In this realm there is no fixed significance of things. The\nonly reality here is the libido, for which “all that is perishable is\nmerely a symbol.” It is not the physical actual mother, but the libido\nof the son, the object of which was once the mother. We take mythologic\nsymbols much too concretely and wonder at every step about the endless\ncontradictions. These contradictions arise only because we constantly\nforget that in the realm of phantasy “feeling is all.” Whenever we read,\ntherefore, “his mother was a wicked sorcerer,” the translation is as\nfollows: The son is in love with her, namely, he is unable to detach his\nlibido from the mother-imago; he therefore suffers from incestuous\nresistance.\n\nThe symbolism of water and trees, which are met with as further\nattributes in the symbol of the City, also refer to that amount of\nlibido which unconsciously is fastened to the mother-imago. In certain\nparts of Revelation the unconscious psychology of religious longing is\nrevealed, namely, the longing for the _mother_.[452] The expectation of\nRevelation ends in the mother: καὶ πᾶν κατάθεμα οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι (“and\nthere shall be no more curse”). There shall be no more sins, no\nrepression, no disharmony with one’s self, no guilt, no fear of death\nand no pain of separation more!\n\nThus Revelation echoes that same radiant mystical harmony which was\ncaught again 2,000 years later and expressed poetically in the last\nprayer of Dr. Marianus:\n\n            “Penitents, look up, elate,\n            Where she beams salvation;\n            Gratefully to blessed fate\n            Grow, in recreation!\n            Be our souls, as they have been,\n            Dedicate to thee!\n            Virgin Holy, Mother, Queen,\n            Goddess, gracious be!”        —_Goethe: Faust._\n\nOne principal question arises at the sight of this beauty and greatness\nof feeling, that is, whether the primary tendency compensated by\nreligion is not too narrowly understood as incestuous. I have previously\nobserved in regard to this that I consider the “resistance opposed to\nlibido” as in a general way coincident with the incest prohibition. I\nmust leave open for the present the definition of the psychological\nincest conception. However, I will here emphasize the point that it is\nmost especially the totality of the sun myth which proves to us that the\nfundamental basis of the “incestuous” desire does not aim at\ncohabitation, but at the special thought of becoming a child again, of\nturning back to the parent’s protection, of coming into the mother once\nmore in order to be born again. But incest stands in the path to this\ngoal, that is to say, the necessity of in some way again gaining\nentrance into the mother’s womb. One of the simplest ways would be to\nimpregnate the mother, and to reproduce one’s self identically. But here\nthe incest prohibition interferes; therefore, the myths of the sun or of\nrebirth teem with all possible proposals as to how incest can be evaded.\nA very simple method of avoidance is to transform the mother into\nanother being or to rejuvenate[453] her after birth has occurred, to\nhave her disappear again or have her change back. It is not incestuous\ncohabitation which is desired, but the rebirth, which now is attained\nmost readily through cohabitation. But this is not the only way,\nalthough perhaps the original one. The resistance to the incest\nprohibition makes the phantasy inventive; for example, it was attempted\nto impregnate the mother by means of a magic charm of fertility (to wish\nfor a child). Attempts in this respect remain in the stage of mythical\nphantasies; but they have one result, and that is the exercise of the\nphantasy which gradually produces paths through the creation of\nphantastic possibilities, in which the libido, taking an active part,\ncan flow off. Thus the libido becomes _spiritualized in an imperceptible\nmanner_. The power “which always wishes evil” thus creates a spiritual\nlife. Therefore, in religions, this course is now raised to a system. On\nthat account it is exceedingly instructive to see how religion takes\npains to further these symbolic transferences.[454] The New Testament\nfurnishes us with an excellent example in regard to this. Nicodemus, in\nthe speech regarding rebirth, cannot forbear understanding the matter\nvery realistically.\n\n  _John_ iii:4:\n\n  (4) “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time\n  into his mother’s womb, and be born?”\n\nBut Jesus endeavors to raise into purity the sensuous view of\nNicodemus’s mind moulded in materialistic heaviness, and announces to\nhim—really the same—and yet not the same:\n\n  (5) “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water\n  and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\n\n  (6) “That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born\n  of the spirit is spirit.\n\n  (7) “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.\n\n  (8) “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound\n  thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so\n  is everyone that is born of the spirit.”\n\nTo be born of water means simply to be born from the mother’s womb. To\nbe born of the spirit means to be born from the fructifying breath of\nthe wind; this we learn from the Greek text (where spirit and wind are\nexpressed by the same word, πνεῦμα) τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκος σάρξ\nἐστιν, καὶ τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος πνεῦμά ἐστιν.—Τὸ πνεῦμα ὅπου\nθέλει πνεῖ,[455] etc.\n\nThis symbolism rose from the same need as that which produced the\nEgyptian legend of the vultures, the mother symbol. They were only\nfemales and were fertilized by the wind. One recognizes very clearly the\nethical demand as the foundation of these mythologic assertions: _thou\nmust say of the mother that she was not impregnated by a mortal in the\nordinary way, but by a spiritual being in an unusual manner_. This\ndemand stands in strict opposition to the real truth; therefore, the\nmyth is a fitting solution. One can say it was a hero who died and was\nborn again in a remarkable manner, and in this way attained immortality.\nThe need which this demand asserts is evidently a prohibition against a\ndefinite phantasy concerning the mother. A son may naturally think that\na father has generated him in a carnal way, but not that he himself\nimpregnated the mother and so caused himself to be born again into\nrenewed youth. This incestuous phantasy which for some reason possesses\nan extraordinary strength,[456] and, therefore, appears as a compulsory\nwish, is repressed and, conforming to the above demand, under certain\nconditions, expresses itself again, symbolically, concerning the problem\nof birth, or rather concerning individual rebirth from the mother. In\nJesus’s challenge to Nicodemus we clearly recognize this tendency:\n“Think not carnally or thou art carnal, but think symbolically, then art\nthou spirit.” It is evident how extremely educative and developing this\ncompulsion toward symbolism can be. Nicodemus would remain fixed in low\ncommonplaces if he did not succeed in raising himself through symbols\nabove this repressed incestuous desire. As a righteous philistine of\nculture, he probably was not very anxious for this effort, because men\nseem really to remain satisfied in repressing the incestuous libido, and\nat best to express it by some modest religious exercises. Yet it seems\nto be important, on the other side, that man should not merely renounce\nand repress and thereby remain firmly fixed in the incestuous bond, but\nthat he should redeem those dynamic forces which lie bound up in incest,\nin order to fulfil himself. For man needs his whole libido, to fill out\nthe boundaries of his personality, and then, for the first time, he is\nin a condition to do his best. The paths by which man may manifest his\nincestuously fixed libido seem to have been pointed out by the religious\nmythologic symbols. On this account Jesus teaches Nicodemus: “Thou\nthinkest of thy incestuous wish for rebirth, but thou must think that\nthou art born from the water and that thou art generated by the breath\nof the wind,[457] and in this way thou shalt share in eternal life.”\n\nThus the libido which lies inactive in the incestuous bond repressed and\nin fear of the law and the avenging Father God can be led over into\nsublimation through the symbol of baptism (birth from water) and of\ngeneration (spiritual birth) through the symbol of the descent of the\nHoly Ghost. Thus man becomes a child[458] again and is born into a\ncircle of brothers and sisters; but his mother is the “communion of the\nsaints,” the church, and his circle of brothers and sisters is humanity,\nwith whom he is united anew in the common inheritance of the primitive\nsymbol.",
