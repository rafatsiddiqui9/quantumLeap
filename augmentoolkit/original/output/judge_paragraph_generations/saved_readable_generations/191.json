Behind those that are born he stands;  at ending time ingathers all the worlds he hath evolved, protector  (he).(3) \u201cHe hath eyes on all sides, on all sides surely hath faces, arms  surely on all sides, on all sides feet. With arms, with wings he  tricks them out, creating heaven and earth, the only God.(4) \u201cWho of the gods is both the source and growth, the Lord of all,  the Rudra. Mighty seer; who brought the shining germ of old into  existence\u2014may he with reason pure conjoin us.\u201d[208]These attributes allow us clearly to discern the all-creator and in him the Sun, which has wings and with a thousand eyes scans the world.[209]The following passages confirm the text and join to it the idea most important for us, that God is also contained in the individual creature:(7) \u201cBeyond this (world) the Brahman beyond, the mighty one, in every  creature hid according to its form, the one encircling Lord of all,  Him having known, immortal they become.(8) \u201cI know this mighty man, Sun-like, beyond the darkness, Him (and  him) only knowing, one crosseth over death; no other path (at all) is  there to go.(11) \u201c... spread over the universe is He the Lord therefore as  all-pervader, He\u2019s benign.\u201dThe powerful God, the equal of the Sun, is in that one, and whoever knows him is immortal.[210] Going on further with the text, we come upon a new attribute, which informs us in what form and manner Rudra lived in men.(12) \u201cThe mighty monarch, He, the man, the one who doth the essence  start towards that peace of perfect stainlessness, lordly, exhaustless  light.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
