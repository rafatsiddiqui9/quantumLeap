  "original_text": "It is the typical myth of the work of the hero, distributed over the\nentire world. He takes to a boat, fights with the sea monster, is\ndevoured, he defends himself against being bitten or crushed[684]\n(resistance or stamping motive); having arrived in the interior of the\n“whale dragon,” he seeks the vital organ, which he cuts off or in some\nway destroys. Often the death of the monster occurs as the result of a\nfire which the hero secretly makes within him; he mysteriously creates\nin the womb of death life, the rising sun. Thus dies the fish, which\ndrifts ashore, where, with the assistance of “birds,” the hero again\nattains the light of day.[685] The bird in this sense probably means the\nreascent of the sun, the longing of the libido, the rebirth of the\nphœnix. (The longing is very frequently represented by the symbol of\nhovering.) The sun symbol of the bird rising from the water is\n(etymologically) contained in the singing swan. “Swan” is derived from\nthe root _sven_, like sun and tone. (See the preceding.) This act\nsignifies rebirth, and the bringing forth of life from the mother,[686]\nand by this means the ultimate destruction of death, which, according to\na Negro myth, has come into the world, through the mistake of an old\nwoman, who, at the time of the general casting of skins (for men renewed\ntheir youth through casting their skin like snakes), drew on, through\nabsent-mindedness, her old skin instead of a new one, and as a result\ndied. But the effect of such an act could not be of any duration. Again\nand again troubles of the hero are renewed, always under the symbol of\ndeliverance from the mother. Just as Hera (as the pursuing mother) is\nthe real source of the great deeds of Hercules, so does Nokomis allow\nHiawatha no rest, and raises up new difficulties in his path, in form of\ndesperate adventures in which the hero may perhaps conquer, but also,\nperhaps, may perish. The libido of mankind is always in advance of his\nconsciousness; unless his libido calls him forth to new dangers he sinks\ninto slothful inactivity or, on the other hand, childish longing for the\nmother overcomes him at the summit of his existence, and he allows\nhimself to become pitifully weak, instead of striving with desperate\ncourage towards the highest. The mother becomes the demon, who summons\nthe hero to adventure, and who also places in his path the poisonous\nserpent, which will strike him. Thus Nokomis, in the ninth song, calls\nHiawatha, points with her hand to the west, where the sun sets in purple\nsplendor, and says to him:\n\n[Illustration: MATUTA, AN ETRUSCAN PIETÀ]\n\n                “Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather,\n                Megissogwon, the Magician,\n                Manito of Wealth and Wampum,\n                Guarded by his fiery serpents,\n                Guarded by the black pitch-water.\n                You can see his fiery serpents,\n                The Kenabeek, the great serpents,\n                Coiling, playing in the water.”\n\nThis danger lurking in the west is known to mean death, which no one,\neven the mightiest, escapes. This magician, as we learn, also killed the\nfather of Nokomis. Now she sends her son forth to avenge the father\n(Horus). Through the symbols attributed to the magician it may easily be\nrecognized what he symbolizes. Snake and water belong to the mother, the\nsnake as a symbol of the repressed longing for the mother, or, in other\nwords, as a symbol of resistance, encircles protectingly and defensively\nthe maternal rock, inhabits the cave, winds itself upwards around the\nmother tree and guards the precious hoard, the “mysterious” treasure.\nThe black Stygian water is, like the black, muddy spring of Dhulqarnein,\nthe place where the sun dies and enters into rebirth, the maternal sea\nof death and night. On his journey thither Hiawatha takes with him the\nmagic oil of Mishe-Nahma, which helps his boat through the waters of\ndeath. (Also a sort of charm for immortality, like the dragon’s blood\nfor Siegfried, etc.)\n\nFirst, Hiawatha slays the great serpent. Of the “night journey in the\nsea” over the Stygian waters it is written:\n\n                 “All night long he sailed upon it,\n                 Sailed upon that sluggish water,\n                 Covered with its mould of ages,\n                 Black with rotting water-rushes,\n                 Rank with flags, and leaves of lilies,\n                 Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,\n                 Lighted by the shimmering moonlight\n                 And by will-o’-the-wisps illumined,\n                 Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,\n                 In their weary night encampments.”\n\nThe description plainly shows the character of a water of death. The\ncontents of the water point to an already mentioned motive, that of\nencoiling and devouring. It is said in the “Key to Dreams of\nJagaddeva”:[687]\n\n  “Whoever in dreams surrounds his body with bast, creepers or ropes,\n  with snake-skins, threads, or tissues, dies.”\n\nI refer to the preceding arguments in regard to this. Having come into\nthe west land, the hero challenges the magician to battle. A terrible\nstruggle begins. Hiawatha is powerless, because Megissogwon is\ninvulnerable. At evening Hiawatha retires wounded, despairing for a\nwhile, in order to rest:\n\n                “Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,\n                From whose branches trailed the mosses,\n                And whose trunk was coated over\n                With the Dead-man’s Moccasin-leather,\n                With the fungus white and yellow.”\n\nThis protecting tree is described as coated over with the moccasin\nleather of the dead, the fungus. This investing of the tree with\nanthropomorphic attributes is also an important rite wherever tree\nworship prevails, as, for example, in India, where each village has its\nsacred tree, which is clothed and in general treated as a human being.\nThe trees are anointed with fragrant waters, sprinkled with powder,\nadorned with garlands and draperies. Just as among men, the piercing of\nthe _ears was performed as an apotropaic charm against death, so does it\noccur with the holy tree_. Of all the trees of India there is none more\nsacred to the Hindoos than the Aswatha (Ficus religiosa). It is known to\nthem as Vriksha Raja (king of trees), Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesvar live\nin it, and the worship of it is the worship of the triad. Almost every\nIndian village has an Aswatha,[688] etc. This “village linden tree,”\nwell known to us, is here clearly characterized as the mother symbol; it\ncontains the three gods.\n\nHence, when Hiawatha retires to rest under the pine-tree,[689] it is a\ndangerous step, because he resigns himself to the mother, whose garment\nis the garment of death (the devouring mother). As in the whale-dragon,\nthe hero also in this situation needs a “helpful bird”; that is to say,\nthe helpful animals, which represent the benevolent parents:\n\n                 “Suddenly from the boughs above him\n                 Sang the Mama, the woodpecker;\n                 ‘Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,\n                 At the head of Megissogwon,\n                 Strike the tuft of hair upon it,\n                 At their roots the long black tresses;\n                 There alone can he be wounded.’”\n\nNow, amusing to relate, Mama hurried to his help. It is a peculiar fact\nthat the woodpecker was also the “Mama” of Romulus and Remus, who put\nnourishment into the mouths of the twins with his beak.[690] (Compare\nwith that the rôle of the vulture in Leonardo’s dream. The vulture is\nsacred to Mars, like the woodpecker.) With the maternal significance of\nthe woodpecker, the ancient Italian folk-superstition agrees: that from\nthe tree upon which this bird nested any nail which has been driven in\nwill soon drop out again.[691] The woodpecker owes its special\nsignificance to the circumstance that he _hammers holes into trees_.\n(“To drive nails in,” as above!) It is, therefore, understandable that\nhe was made much of in the Roman legend as an old king of the country, a\npossessor or ruler of the holy tree, the primitive image of the\nPaterfamilias. An old fable relates how Circe, the spouse of King Picus,\ntransformed him into the Picus Martius, the woodpecker. The sorceress is\nthe “new-creating mother,” who has “magic influence” upon the\nsun-husband. She kills him, transforms him into the soul-bird, the\nunfulfilled wish. Picus was also understood as the wood demon and\nincubus, as well as the soothsayer, all of which fully indicate the\nmother libido.[692] Picus was often placed on a par with Picumnus by the\nancients. Picumnus is the inseparable companion of Pilumnus, and both\nare actually called _infantium dii_, “the gods of little children.”\nEspecially it was said of Pilumnus that he defended new-born children\nagainst the destroying attacks of the wood demon, Silvanus. (Good and\nbad mother, the motive of the two mothers.)\n\nThe benevolent bird, a wish thought of deliverance which arises from\nintroversion,[693] advises the hero to shoot the magician under the\nhair, which is the only vulnerable spot. This spot is the “phallic”\npoint,[694] if one may venture to say so; it is at _the top of the\nhead_, at the _place where the mystic birth from the head takes place_,\nwhich even to-day appears in children’s sexual theories. Into that\nHiawatha shoots (one may say, very naturally) three arrows[695] (the\nwell-known phallic symbol), and thus kills Megissogwon. Thereupon he\nsteals the magic wampum armor, which renders him invulnerable (means of\nimmortality). He significantly leaves the dead lying in the\nwater—because the magician is the fearful mother:\n\n                   “On the shore he left the body,\n                   Half on land and half in water,\n                   In the sand his feet were buried,\n                   And his face was in the water.”\n\nThus the situation is the same as with the fish king, because the\nmonster is the personification of the water of death, which in its turn\nrepresents the devouring mother. This great deed of Hiawatha’s, where he\nhas vanquished the mother as the death-bringing demon,[696] is followed\nby his marriage with Minnehaha.\n\nA little fable which the poet has inserted in the later song is\nnoteworthy. An old man is transformed into a youth, by _crawling through\na hollow oak tree_.\n\nIn the fourteenth song is a description of how Hiawatha discovers\nwriting. I limit myself to the description of two hieroglyphic tokens:\n\n                  “Gitche Manito the Mighty,\n                  He, the Master of Life, was painted\n                  As an egg, with points projecting\n                  To the four winds of the heavens.\n                  Everywhere is the Great Spirit,\n                  Was the meaning of this symbol.”\n\nThe world lies in the egg, which encompasses it at every point; it is\nthe cosmic woman with child, the symbol of which Plato as well as the\nVedas has made use of. This mother is like the air, which is everywhere.\nBut air is spirit; the mother of the world is a spirit:\n\n                    “Mitche Manito the Mighty,\n                    He the dreadful Spirit of Evil,\n                    As a serpent was depicted,\n                    As Kenabeek, the great serpent.”\n\nBut the spirit of evil is fear, is the forbidden desire, the adversary\nwho opposes not only each individual heroic deed, but life in its\nstruggle for eternal duration as well, and who introduces into our body\nthe poison of weakness and age through the treacherous bite of the\nserpent. It is all that is retrogressive, and as the model of our first\nworld is our mother, all retrogressive tendencies are towards the\nmother, and, therefore, are disguised under the incest image.\n\nIn both these ideas the poet has represented in mythologic symbols the\nlibido arising from the mother and the libido striving backward towards\nthe mother.\n\nThere is a description in the fifteenth song how Chibiabos, Hiawatha’s\nbest friend, the amiable player and singer, the embodiment of the joy of\nlife, was enticed by the evil spirits into ambush, fell through the ice\nand was drowned. Hiawatha mourns for him so long that he succeeds, with\nthe aid of the magician, in calling him back again. But the revivified\nfriend is only a spirit, and he becomes master of the land of spirits.\n(Osiris, lord of the underworld; the two Dioscuri.) Battles again\nfollow, and then comes the loss of a second friend, Kwasind, the\nembodiment of physical strength.\n\nIn the twentieth song occur famine and the death of Minnehaha, foretold\nby two taciturn guests from the land of death; and in the twenty-second\nsong Hiawatha prepares for a final journey to the west land:",
