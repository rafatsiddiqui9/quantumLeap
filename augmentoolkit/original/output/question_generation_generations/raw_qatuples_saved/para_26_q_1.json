    "paragraph": "Thus Revelation echoes that same radiant mystical harmony which was caught again 2,000 years later and expressed poetically in the last prayer of Dr. Marianus:\u201cPenitents, look up, elate,       Where she beams salvation;       Gratefully to blessed fate       Grow, in recreation!       Be our souls, as they have been,       Dedicate to thee!       Virgin Holy, Mother, Queen,       Goddess, gracious be!\u201d    \u2014_Goethe: Faust.__John_ iii:4:(4) \u201cHow can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time  into his mother\u2019s womb, and be born?\u201dBut Jesus endeavors to raise into purity the sensuous view of Nicodemus\u2019s mind moulded in materialistic heaviness, and announces to him\u2014really the same\u2014and yet not the same:(5) \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water  and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.(6) \u201cThat which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born  of the spirit is spirit.(7) \u201cMarvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.(8) \u201cThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound  thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so  is everyone that is born of the spirit.\u201dTo be born of water means simply to be born from the mother\u2019s womb. To be born of the spirit means to be born from the fructifying breath of the wind; this we learn from the Greek text (where spirit and wind are expressed by the same word, \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1) \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03ac \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd.\u2014\u03a4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f45\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6,[455] etc.",

    "question": "What does John 3:4-8 convey about the nature of spiritual rebirth, and how does it differ from physical birth?",
    "answer": "John 3:4-8 conveys that spiritual rebirth, or being \"born of the spirit,\" is different from physical birth. Jesus explains that unless a person is born both \"of water and of the spirit,\" they cannot enter the kingdom of God. Physical birth from a mother's womb is likened to the flesh, whereas being \"born of the spirit\" is compared to the breath of the wind, symbolizing a transformation of the soul. This spiritual rebirth is essential for entering the spiritual realm.",
