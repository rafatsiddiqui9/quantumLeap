    "paragraph": "The active fructifying (upward striving) form of the libido is changed into the negative force striving downwards towards death. The hero as zodion of spring (ram, bull) conquers the depths of winter; and beyond the summer solstice is attacked by the unconscious longing for death, and is bitten by the snake. However, he himself is the snake. But he is at war with himself, and, therefore, the descent and the end appear to him as the malicious inventions of the mother of death, who in this way wishes to draw him to herself. The mysteries, however, consolingly promise that there is no contradiction[782] or disharmony when life is changed into death: \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd.Nietzsche, too, gives expression to this mystery:[783]\u201c_Here do I sit now_,        That is, I\u2019m swallowed down        By this the smallest oasis\u2014        \u2014It opened up just yawning,        Its loveliest maw agape.

Stone grinds on stone, the desert        Gulps and strangles.        The monstrous death gazes, glowing brown,        And chews\u2014his life is his chewing ...

    "question": "How does the hero represent this transformation in the context of the seasons?",
    "answer": "The hero, as a zodion of spring (symbolized by the ram or bull), conquers the depths of winter. However, beyond the summer solstice, he is attacked by an unconscious longing for death, represented by being bitten by a snake. This snake is paradoxically the hero himself, symbolizing his own descent into death.",
