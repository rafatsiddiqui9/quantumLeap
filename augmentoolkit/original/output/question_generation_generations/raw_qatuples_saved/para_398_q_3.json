    "paragraph": " The contrast is so enormous that one must assume that the valuations of childhood must indeed be very different from ours. This is actually the truth. Children bring to the act of defecation and the products of this an esteem and interest[359] which later on is possible only to the hypochondriac. We do not comprehend this interest until we learn that the child very early connects with it a theory of propagation.[360] The libido afflux probably accounts for the enormous interest in this act. The child sees that this is the way in which something is produced, in which something comes out. The same child whom I reported in the little brochure \u201c\u00dcber Konflikte der kindlichen Seele,\u201d and who had a well-developed anal theory of birth, like little Hans, whom Freud made known to us, later contracted a habit of staying a long time on the toilet. Once the father grew impatient, went to the toilet and called, \u201cDo come out of there; what are you making?\u201d Whereupon the answer came from within, \u201cA little wagon and two ponies.\u201d The child was making a little wagon and two ponies, that is to say, things which at that time she especially wished for. In this way one can make what one wishes, and the thing made is the thing wished for. The child wishes earnestly for a doll or, at heart, for a real child. (That is, the child practised for his future biological task, and in the way in which everything in general is produced he made the doll[361] himself as representative of the child or of the thing wished for in general.[362]) From a patient I have learned a parallel phantasy of her childhood. In the toilet there was a crevice in the wall. She phantasied that from this crevice a fairy would come out and present her with everything for which she wished. The \u201clocus\u201d is known to be the place of dreams where much was wished for and created which later would no longer be suspected of having this place of origin.",

    "question": "What additional example is provided to illustrate a child's phantasy related to the toilet, and how does it connect to the child's wishes?",
    "answer": "Another example provided is of a patient who phantasized that a fairy would come out of a crevice in the wall of the toilet and present her with everything she wished for. This phantasy connects to the child's wishes, as it reflects the idea that the toilet is a place where much is wished for and created, later becoming the origin of dreams and desires.",
