    "paragraph": "Faust takes the reverse course; for him the ascetic ideal means death. He struggles for freedom and wins life, at the same time giving himself over to the Evil One; but through this he becomes the bringer of death to her whom he loves most, Marguerite. He tears himself away from pain and sacrifices his life in unceasing useful work, through which he saves many lives.[114] His double mission as saviour and destroyer has already been hinted in a preliminary manner:_Wagner_:With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou        Receive the people\u2019s honest veneration!_Faust_:Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,      Among these vales and hills surrounding,      Worse than the pestilence, have passed.      Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;      And I must hear, by all the living,      The shameless murderers praised at last!A parallel to this double r\u00f4le is that text in the Gospel of Matthew which has become historically significant:\u201cI came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d\u2014_Matt._ x: 34.Just this constitutes the deep significance of Goethe\u2019s Faust, that he clothes in words a problem of modern man which has been turning in restless slumber since the Renaissance, just as was done by the drama of Oedipus for the Hellenic sphere of culture. What is to be the way out between the Scylla of renunciation of the world and the Charybdis of the acceptance of the world?",

    "question": "What is the deeper significance of Goethe's Faust according to the text, and how does it relate to a historical problem?\n\n**ANSigers\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the deeper significance of Goethe's Faust, and how does it relate to a historical problem?",
    "answer": "The deeper significance of Goethe's Faust lies in its portrayal of a problem that has been a central concern since the Renaissance. Specifically, the text suggests that Goethe's work clothes in words this modern problem, which is about finding a way out between the Scylla of renunciation of the world and the Charybdis of the acceptance of the world. This metaphorical journey reflects the dilemma faced by modern individuals in deciding how to live their lives in a balanced and meaningful way amidst the complexities of the world.",
