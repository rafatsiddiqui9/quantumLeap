- content: 'Text: """_The conscious phantasies tell us of mythical or other material
    of undeveloped or no longer recognized wish tendencies in the soul._ As is easily
    to be understood, an innate tendency, an acknowledgment of which one refuses to
    make, and which one treats as non-existent, can hardly contain a thing that may
    be in accord with our conscious character. It concerns the tendencies which are
    considered immoral, and as generally impossible, and the strongest resentment
    is felt towards bringing them into the consciousness. What would Oegger have said
    had he been told confidentially that he was preparing himself for the Judas rôle?
    And what in ourselves do we consider immoral and non-existent, or which we at
    least wish were non-existent? It is that which in antiquity lay widespread on
    the surface, viz., sexuality in all its various manifestations. Therefore, we
    need not wonder in the least when we find this at the base of most of our phantasies,
    even if the phantasies have a different appearance. Because Oegger found the damnation
    of Judas incompatible with God’s goodness, he thought about the conflict in that
    way; that is the conscious sequence. Along with this is the unconscious sequence;
    because Oegger himself wished to be a Judas, he first made sure of the goodness
    of God. To Oegger, Judas was the symbol of his own unconscious tendency, and he
    made use of this symbol in order to be able to meditate over his unconscious wish.
    The direct coming into consciousness of the Judas wish would have been too painful
    for him. _Thus, there must be typical myths which are really the instruments of
    a folk-psychological complex treatment._ Jacob Burckhardt seems to have suspected
    this when he once said that every Greek of the classical era carried in himself
    a fragment of the Oedipus, just as every German carries a fragment of Faust.[55]"""
