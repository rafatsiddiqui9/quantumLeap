    "paragraph": "re-echo of an old-folk-belief, which was very widespread originally.[44] The ambitious phantasy chooses, among others, a form which is classic, and which once had a true meaning. The same thing holds good in regard to the sexual phantasy. In the preamble we have spoken of dreams of sexual assault: the robber who breaks into the house and commits a dangerous act. That, too, is a mythological theme, and in the prehistoric era was certainly a reality too.[45] Wholly apart from the fact that the capture of women was something general in the lawless prehistoric times, it was also a subject of mythology in cultivated epochs. I recall the capture of Proserpina, Deianira, Europa, the Sabine women, etc. We must not forget that, even to-day, marriage customs exist in various regions which recall the ancient custom of marriage by capture.",

    "question": "How does the text illustrate the theme of a sexual assault in fantasies, and what historical context does it provide?",
    "answer": "The text illustrates the theme of a sexual assault in fantasies by comparing it to a dream scenario where a robber breaks into a house and commits a dangerous act. It provides historical context by noting that this theme is mythological and was a reality in prehistoric times, where the capture of women was common. This practice was also a subject of mythology in more developed societies, as evidenced by stories like the capture of Proserpina, Deianira, Europa, and the Sabine women.",
