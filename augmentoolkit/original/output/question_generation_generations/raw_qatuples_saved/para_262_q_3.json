    "paragraph": "The fundamental pictures are the sacrificial death and the resurrection of Christ, like the self-sacrifice of the sun, which voluntarily breaks its sceptre, the fructifying rays, in the certain hope of resurrection. The following comments are to be noted in regard to \u201cthe sceptre of rays\u201d: Spielrein\u2019s patient says, \u201cGod pierces through the earth with his rays.\u201d The earth, in the patient\u2019s mind, has the meaning of woman. She also comprehends the sunbeam in mythologic fashion as something solid: \u201cJesus Christ has shown me his love, by striking against the window with a sunbeam.\u201d Among other insane patients I have come across the same idea of the solid substance of the sunbeam. Here there is also a hint of the phallic nature of the instrument which is associated with the hero. Thor\u2019s hammer, which, cleaving the earth, penetrates deeply into it, may be compared to the foot of Kaineus. The hammer is retained in the interior of the earth, like the treasure, and, in the course of time, it gradually comes again to the surface (\u201cthe treasure blooms\u201d), meaning that it was born again from the earth. (Compare what has been said concerning the etymology of \u201cswelling.\u201d) On many monuments Mithra holds a peculiar object in his hands, which Cumont compares to a half-filled tube. Dieterich proves from his papyrus text that the object is the shoulder of the bull, the bear constellation. The shoulder has an indirect phallic meaning, for it is the part which is wanting in Pelops. Pelops was slaughtered by his father, Tantalus, dismembered, and boiled in a kettle, to make a meal for the gods. Demeter had unsuspectingly eaten the shoulder from this feast, when Zeus discovered the outrage. He had the pieces thrown back into the kettle, and, with the help of the life-dispensing Clotho, Pelops was regenerated, and the shoulder which was missing was replaced by an ivory one. This substitution is a close ",

    "question": "What is the significance of the missing shoulder in the myth about Pelops, and how is this connected to the concept of regeneration?",
    "answer": "The missing shoulder in the myth about Pelops is significant because Pelops was slaughtered by his father, Tantalus, and dismembered. The shoulder was one of the parts that Tantalus ate as part of a sacrificial meal. Demeter unknowingly ate the shoulder, prompting Zeus to regroup the pieces and regenerate Pelops, replacing the missing shoulder with an ivory one. This substitution symbolizes the concept of regeneration and rebirth.",
