{"paragraph": "\u201cAnd Isis came with her wisdom:    Her mouth is full of the breath of life,    Her words banish sorrow,    And her speech animates those who no longer breathe.    She said: \u2018What is that; what is that, divine father?    Behold, a worm has brought you sorrow\u2014\u2014\u2019\u201c\u2018Tell me thy name, divine father,    Because the man remains alive, who is called by his name.\u2019\u201dWhereupon R\u00ea replied:\u201c\u2018I am he, who created heaven and earth, and piled up the hills,   And created all beings thereon.   I am he, who made the water and caused the great flood,   Who produced the bull of his mother,   Who is the procreator,\u2019 etc.\u201cThe poison did not depart, it went further,   The great God was not cured.   Then said Isis to R\u00ea:   \u2018Thine is not the name thou hast told me.   Tell me true that the poison may leave thee,   For he whose name is spoken will live.\u2019\u201dFinally R\u00ea decides to speak his true name. He is approximately healed (imperfect composition of Osiris); but he has lost his power, and finally he retreats to the heavenly cow.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
