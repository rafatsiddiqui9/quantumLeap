    "paragraph": "After the birth the four genii of the East, West, South and North come to render service as bearers of the palanquin. (The coming of the wise men at Christ\u2019s birth.) We also find here a distinct reference to the \u201cfour winds.\u201d For the completion of the symbolism there is to be found in the Buddha myth, as well as in the birth legend of Christ, besides the impregnation by star and wind, also the fertilization by an animal, here an elephant, which with its phallic trunk fulfilled in Maya the Christian method of fructification through the ear or the head. It is well known that, in addition to the dove, the unicorn is also a procreative symbol of the Logos.Here arises the question why the birth of a hero always had to take place under such strange symbolic circumstances? It might also be imagined that a hero arose from ordinary surroundings and gradually grew out of his inferior environment, perhaps with a thousand troubles and dangers. (And, indeed, this motive is by no means strange in the hero myth.) It might be said that superstition demands strange conditions of birth and generation; but why does it demand them?",

    "question": "How do the symbolic elements in the birth of a hero, such as the participation of genii and the use of an elephant, serve the hero myth?",
    "answer": "The symbolic elements in the birth of a hero, such as the participation of genii and the use of an elephant, serve to enhance the hero's divinity and importance. The genii representing the four directions emphasize the hero's universal significance and connection to the cosmos. The elephant, with its phallic trunk, symbolizes the fertilization process, linking the hero's birth to powerful, sacred forces. These elements contribute to the hero myth by elevating the hero's status and highlighting the extraordinary circumstances of his birth.",
