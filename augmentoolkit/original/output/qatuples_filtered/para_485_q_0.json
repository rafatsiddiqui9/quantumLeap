    "paragraph": "With this statement Jung throws a new light on the work of analytic psychology and on the conception of the neurotic symptoms, and renders possible of understanding the many apparent incongruities and conflicting observations which have been so disturbing to the critics.It now becomes proper to ask what has been established by all this mass of investigation into the soul, and what is its value not only as a therapeutic measure for the neurotic sufferer, but also for the normal human being?First and perhaps most important is the recognition of a definite psychological determinism. Instead of human life being filled with foolish, meaningless or purposeless actions, errors and thoughts, it can be demonstrated that no expression or manifestation of the psyche, however trifling or inconsistent in appearance, is really lawless or unmotivated. Only a possession of the technique is necessary in order to reveal, to any one desirous of knowing, the existence of the unconscious determinants of his mannerisms, trivial expressions, acts and behavior, their purpose and significance.",

    "question": "What does Jung's statement about the work of analytic psychology reveal about human behavior and actions?",
    "answer": "Jung's statement reveals that human life is not filled with foolish, meaningless, or purposeless actions, errors, and thoughts. Instead, every expression or manifestation of the psyche, no matter how trivial or seemingly inconsistent, has a definite psychological determinism. This means that there are unconscious determinants behind these actions, mannerisms, and behaviors, and these determinants have a purpose and significance.",
