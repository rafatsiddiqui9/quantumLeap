    "paragraph": " possession of the \u2018I\u2019 can be shown as little as the reverse; the  secondary or induced disturbances of the libido processes through  abnormal changes in the \u2018I.\u2019 It is probable that processes of this  sort form the distinctive character of the psychoses. The conclusions  arising from this, in relation to paranoia, are at present uncertain.  One cannot assert that the paranoiac has completely withdrawn his  interest from the outer world, nor withdrawn into the heights of  repression, as one sometimes sees in certain other forms of  hallucinatory psychoses. He takes notice of the outer world, he takes  account of its changes, he is stirred to explanations by their  influence, and therefore I consider it highly probable that the  changed relation to the world is to be explained, wholly or in great  part, by the deficiency of the libido interest.\u201d",
