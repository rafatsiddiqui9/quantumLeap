    "paragraph": "He turns, therefore, even further away, into that early youthful period, the tones of which recall Minnehaha most forcibly to his thoughts, where he learnt to hear the mother-sounds in the sounds of nature. In this very strange revival of the impressions of nature we recognize a regression to those earliest and strongest nature impressions which stand next to the subsequently extinguished, even stronger, impressions which the child received from the mother. The glamour of this feeling for her is transferred to other objects of the childish environment (father\u2019s house, playthings, etc.), from which later those magic blissful feelings proceed, which seem to be peculiar to the earliest childish memories. When, therefore, Hiawatha hides himself in the lap of nature, it is really the mother\u2019s womb, and it is to be expected that he will emerge again new-born in some form.",

    "question": "What role does the mother play in the early nature impressions and their transfer to other objects?",
    "answer": "The mother plays a central role in the early nature impressions, as the feelings and impressions the child has for her are transferred to other objects in the childhood environment, such as the father\u2019s house and playthings. These early impressions are strong and enduring, and they influence the child\u2019s later memories and feelings, creating a sense of magic and bliss associated with the earliest childish experiences.",
