    "paragraph": "Therefore, at first glance, it does not seem possible for us to assume that that energy and interest which to-day we put into science and technic, the man of antiquity gave in great part to his mythology. That, nevertheless, gives the explanation for the bewildering changes, the kaleidoscopic transformations and new syncretistic groupings, and the continued rejuvenation of the myths in the Grecian sphere of culture. Here, we move in a world of phantasies, which, little concerned with the outer course of things, flows from an inner source, and, constantly changing, creates now plastic, now shadowy shapes. This phantastical activity of the ancient mind created artistically _par excellence_. The object of the interest does not seem to have been to grasp hold of the \u201chow\u201d of the real world as objectively and exactly as possibly, but to \u00e6sthetically adapt subjective phantasies and expectations. There was very little place among ancient people for the coldness and disillusion which Giordano Bruno\u2019s thoughts on eternity and Kepler\u2019s discoveries brought to modern humanity. The na\u00efve man of antiquity saw in the sun the great Father of the heaven and the earth, and in the moon the fruitful good Mother. Everything had its demons; they animated equally a human being and his brother, the animal. Everything was considered according to its anthropomorphic or theriomorphic attributes, as human being or animal. Even the disc of the sun was given wings or four feet, in order to illustrate its movement. Thus arose an idea of the universe which was not only very far from reality, but was one which corresponded wholly to subjective phantasies.",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the focus of ancient people's interests compared to modern people's interests?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that ancient people were more focused on \u00e6sthetically adapting subjective phantasies and expectations rather than grasping the \"how\" of the real world in an objective and exact manner. Modern people, in contrast, are more likely to experience coldness and disillusion, as seen in the works of Giordano Bruno and Kepler.",
