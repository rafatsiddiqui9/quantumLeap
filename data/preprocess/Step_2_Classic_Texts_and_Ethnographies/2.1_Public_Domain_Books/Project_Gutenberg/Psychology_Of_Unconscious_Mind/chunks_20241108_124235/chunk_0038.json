The bearer of the mystery is\nplaced in opposition to the multitude of the ignorant. _The possession\nof the mystery cuts one off from intercourse with the rest of mankind._\nFor a very complete and smooth rapport with the surroundings is of great\nimportance for the management of the libido and the _possession of a\nsubjectively important secret generally creates a great disturbance_. It\nmay be said that the whole art of life shrinks to the one problem of how\nthe libido may be freed in the most harmless way possible. Therefore,\nthe neurotic derives special benefit in treatment when he can at last\nrid himself of his various secrets. The symbol of the crowd of people,\nchiefly the streaming and moving mass, is, as I have often seen,\nsubstituted for the great excitement in the unconscious, especially in\npersons who are outwardly calm.\n\nThe vision of the “throng” develops further; horses emerge; a battle is\nfought. With Silberer, I might accept the significance of this vision as\nbelonging, first of all, in the “functional category,” because,\nfundamentally, the conception of the intermingling crowds is nothing but\nthe symbol of the present onrush of the mass of thought; likewise the\nbattle, and possibly the horses, which illustrate the movement. The\ndeeper significance of the appearance of the horses will be seen for the\nfirst time in the further course of our treatment of the mother\nsymbolism. The following vision has a more definite and significantly\nimportant character. Miss Miller sees a City of Dreams (“Cité de\nRêves”). The picture is similar to one she saw a short time before on\nthe cover of a magazine. Unfortunately, we learn nothing further about\nit. One can easily imagine under this “Cité de Rêves” a fulfilled wish\ndream, that is to say, something very beautiful and greatly longed for;\na sort of heavenly Jerusalem, as the poet of the Apocalypse has dreamed\nit. The city is a maternal symbol, a woman who fosters the inhabitants\nas children. It is, therefore, intelligible that the two mother\ngoddesses, Rhea and Cybele, both wear the wall crown. The Old Testament\ntreats the cities of Jerusalem, Babel, etc., as women (_Isaiah_\nxlvii:1–5):\n\n  “Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on\n  the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou\n  shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take the millstones and\n  grind meal; uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh,\n  pass over the rivers. That thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy\n  shame shall be seen; sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O\n  daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called the lady\n  of the kingdoms.”\n\nJeremiah says of Babel (I:12):\n\n  “Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be\n  ashamed.”\n\nStrong, unconquered cities are virgins; colonies are sons and daughters.\nCities are also whores. Isaiah says of Tyre (xxiii:16):\n\n  “Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot; thou hast been\n  forgotten.”\n\nAnd:\n\n  “How does it come to pass that the virtuous city has become an\n  harlot?”\n\nWe come across a similar symbolism in the myth of Ogyges, the mythical\nking who rules in Egyptian Thebes and whose wife was appropriately named\nThebe. The Bœotian Thebes founded by Cadmus received on that account a\nsurname, “Ogygian.” This surname was also given to the great flood, as\nit was called “Ogygian” because it occurred under Ogyges. This\ncoincidence will be found later on to be hardly accidental. The fact\nthat the city and the wife of Ogyges bear the same name indicates that\nsomewhere a relation must exist between the city and the woman, which is\nnot difficult to understand, for the city is identical with the woman.\nWe meet a similar idea in Hindoo lore where Indra appears as the husband\nof Urvara, but Urvara means “the fertile land.” In a similar way the\noccupancy of a country by the king was understood as marriage with the\nploughed land. Similar representations must have prevailed in Europe as\nwell. Princes had to guarantee, for example, a good harvest at their\naccession. The Swedish King Domaldi was actually killed on account of\nthe failure of the harvest (Ynglinga sâga 18). In the Rama sâga the hero\nRama marries Sîtâ, the furrow of the field.[424] To the same group of\nideas belongs the Chinese custom of the Emperor ploughing a furrow at\nhis ascension to the throne. This idea of the soil being feminine also\nembraces the idea of continual companionship with the woman, a physical\ncommunication. Shiva, the Phallic God, is, like Mahadeva and Parwati,\nmale and female. He has even given one-half of his body to his consort\nParwati as a dwelling place.[425] Inman[426] gives us a drawing of a\nPundite of Ardanari-Iswara; one-half of the god is masculine, the other\nhalf feminine, and the genitals are in continuous cohabitation. The\nmotive of continuous cohabitation is expressed in a well-known lingam\nsymbol, which is to be found everywhere in Indian temples; the base is a\nfemale symbol, and within that is the phallus.[427] The symbol\napproaches very closely the Grecian mystic phallic basket and chests.\n(Compare with this the Eleusinian mysteries.) The chest or box is here a\nfemale symbol, that is, the mother’s womb. This is a very well-known\nconception in the old mythologies.[428] The chest, basket or little\nbasket, with its precious contents, was thought of as floating on the\nwater; a remarkable inversion of the natural fact that the child floats\nin the amniotic fluid and that this is in the uterus.\n\nThis inversion brings about a great advantage for sublimation, for it\ncreates enormous possibilities of application for the myth-weaving\nphantasy, that is to say, for the annexation to the sun cycle. The Sun\nfloats over the sea like an immortal god, which every evening is\nimmersed in the maternal water and is born again renewed in the morning.\nFrobenius says:\n\n  “Perhaps in connection with the blood-red sunrise, the idea occurs\n  that here a birth takes place, the birth of a young son; the question\n  then arises inevitably, whence comes the paternity? How has the woman\n  become pregnant? And since this woman symbolizes the same idea as the\n  fish, which means the sea, (because we proceed from the assumption\n  that the Sun descends into the sea as well as arises from it) thus the\n  curious primitive answer is that this sea has previously swallowed the\n  old Sun. Consequently the resulting myth is, that the woman (sea) has\n  formerly devoured the Sun and now brings a new Sun into the world, and\n  thus she has become pregnant.”\n\nAll these sea-going gods are sun symbols. They are enclosed in a chest\nor an ark for the “night journey on the sea” (Frobenius), often together\nwith a woman (again an inversion of the actual situation, but in support\nof the motive of continuous cohabitation, which we have met above).\nDuring the night journey on the sea the Sun-god is enclosed in the\nmother’s womb, oftentimes threatened by dangers of all kinds. Instead of\nmany individual examples, I will content myself with reproducing the\nscheme which Frobenius has constructed from numberless myths of this\nsort:\n\n[Illustration: _To devour_ _West_ _East_ _W-E movement—(sea journey)_\n_Heat-hair_ _To slip out_ _To open_ _To land_ _Sea journey_ _To set on\nfire or To cut off the heart_]\n\nFrobenius gives the following legend to illustrate this:\n\n  “A hero is devoured by a water monster in the West (to devour). The\n  animal carries him within him to the East (sea journey). Meanwhile, he\n  kindles a fire in the belly of the monster (to set on fire) and since\n  he feels hungry he cuts off a piece of the hanging heart (to cut off\n  the heart). Soon after he notices that the fish glides upon the dry\n  land (to land); he immediately begins to cut open the animal from\n  within outwards (to open) then he slides out (to slip out). In the\n  fish’s belly, it had been so hot, that all his hair had fallen out\n  (heat-hair). The hero frequently frees all who were previously\n  devoured (to devour all) and all now slide out (slip out).”\n\nA very close parallel is Noah’s journey during the flood, in which all\nliving creatures die; only he and the life guarded by him are brought to\na new birth. In a Melapolynesian legend (Frobenius) it is told that the\nhero in the belly of the King Fish took his weapon and cut open the\nfish’s belly. “He slid out and saw a splendor, and he sat down and\nreflected. ‘I wonder where I am,’ he said. Then the sun rose with a\nbound and turned from one side to the other.” The Sun has again slipped\nout. Frobenius mentions from the Ramayana the myth of the ape Hanuman,\nwho represents the Sun-hero. The sun in which Hanuman hurries through\nthe air throws a shadow upon the sea. The sea monster notices this and\nthrough this draws Hanuman toward itself; when the latter sees that the\nmonster is about to devour him, he stretches out his figure\nimmeasurably; the monster assumes the same gigantic proportions. As he\ndoes that Hanuman becomes as small as a thumb, slips into the great body\nof the monster and comes out on the other side. In another part of the\npoem it is said that he came out from the right ear of the monster (like\nRabelais’ Gargantua, who also was born from the mother’s ear). “Hanuman\nthereupon resumes his flight, and finds a new obstacle in another sea\nmonster, which is the mother of Rahus, the sun-devouring demon. The\nlatter draws Hanuman’s shadow[429] to her in the same way. Hanuman again\nhas recourse to the earlier stratagem, becomes small and slips into her\nbody, but hardly is he there than he grows to a gigantic mass, swells\nup, tears her, kills her, and in that way makes his escape.”\n\nThus we understand why the Indian fire-bringer Mâtariçvan is called “the\none swelling in the mother”; the ark (little box, chest, cask, vessel,\netc.) is a symbol of the womb, just as is the sea, into which the Sun\nsinks for rebirth. From this circle of ideas we understand the\nmythologic statements about Ogyges; he it is who possesses the mother,\nthe City, who is united with the mother; therefore under him came the\ngreat flood, for it is a typical fragment of the sun myth that the hero,\nwhen united with the woman attained with difficulty, is exposed in a\ncask and thrown into the sea, and then lands for a new life on a distant\nshore. The middle part, the “night journey on the sea” in the ark, is\nlacking in the tradition of Ogyges.[430] But the rule in mythology is\nthat the typical parts of a myth can be united in all conceivable\nvariations, which adds greatly to the extraordinary difficulty of the\ninterpretation of a particular myth without knowledge of all the others.\nThe meaning of this cycle of myths mentioned here is clear; it is the\nlonging _to attain rebirth through the return to the mother’s womb, that\nis to say, to become as immortal as the sun_. This longing for the\nmother is frequently expressed in our holy scriptures.[431] I recall,\nparticularly the place in the epistle to the Galatians, where it is said\n(iv:26):\n\n  (26) “But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us\n  all.\n\n  (27) “For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that beareth not: break\n  forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many\n  more children than she which hath an husband.\n\n  (28) “Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.\n\n  (29) “But as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was\n  born after the spirit, even so it is now.\n\n  (30) “Nevertheless, what sayeth the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman\n  and her son; for the son of a bondwoman shall not be heir with the son\n  of a freewoman.\n\n  (31) “So, then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of\n  the free.”\n\nChapter v:\n\n  (1) “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us\n  free.”",
