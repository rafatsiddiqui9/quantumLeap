    "paragraph": "\u201cAye, thou art far away, O holy countenance! And the melody of thy life is kept from me, No longer overheard. And, ah, where are Thy magic songs which once soothed my heart With the peace of Heaven? How long it is, how long! The youth is aged; the very earth itself, which once smiled on me, Has grown different.\u201cOh, farewell!

Painstaking work for a long time and for a remote object is not in the nature of child or primitive man. It is difficult to say if this can really be called laziness, but it seems to have not a little in common with it, in so far as the psychic life on a primitive stage, be it of an infantile or archaic type, possesses an extreme inertia and irresponsibility in production and non-production.The last stanza portends evil, a gazing towards the other land, the distant coast of sunrise or sunset; love no longer holds the poet, the bonds with the world are torn and he calls loudly for assistance to the mother:_Achilles._",
