    "paragraph": "that in the temple of Jerusalem the image of an ass was worshipped. As Drosselbart (horse\u2019s mane) Wotan is half-human, half-horse.[577] An old German riddle very prettily shows this unity between horse and horseman.[578] \u201cWho are the two, who travel to Thing? Together they have three eyes, ten feet[579] and one tail; and thus they travel over the land.\u201d Legends ascribe properties to the horse, which psychologically belong to the unconscious of man; horses are clairvoyant and clairaudient; they show the way when the lost wanderer is helpless; they have mantic powers. In the Iliad the horse prophesies evil. They hear the words which the corpse speaks when it is taken to the grave\u2014words which men cannot hear.

The devil has a horse\u2019s foot; in certain circumstances a horse\u2019s form. At crucial moments he suddenly shows a cloven foot (proverbial) in the same way as in the abduction of Hadding, Sleipneir suddenly looked out from behind Wotan\u2019s mantle.[580] Just as the nightmare rides on the sleeper, so does the devil, and, therefore, it is said that those who have nightmares are ridden by the devil. In Persian lore the devil is the steed of God. The devil, like all evil things, represents sexuality. Witches have intercourse with him, in which case he appears in the form of a goat or horse. The unmistakably phallic nature of the devil is communicated to the horse as well; hence this symbol occurs in connections where this is the only meaning which would furnish an ",

    "question": "What historical examples are given to illustrate horses' prophetic and clairvoyant abilities?",
    "answer": "The text provides two historical examples: In the Iliad, a horse prophesies evil, and Julius Caesar learns from his human-footed horse that he would conquer the world. Additionally, a horse is said to have prophesied to Augustus the victory of Actium, highlighting the horses' ability to provide foresight and guidance.",
