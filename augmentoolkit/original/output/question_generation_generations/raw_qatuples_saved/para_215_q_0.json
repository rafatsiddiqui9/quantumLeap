    "paragraph": "H\u00f6lderlin exemplifies this path in his poetry and his life. I leave the poet to speak in his song:_To the Rose._\u201cIn the Mother-womb eternal,          Sweetest queen of every lea,         Still the living and supernal          Nature carries thee and me.\u201cLittle rose, the storm\u2019s fierce power          Strips our leaves and alters us;         Yet the deathless germ will tower          To new blooms, miraculous.\u201dThe following comments may be made upon the parable of this poem: The rose is the symbol of the beloved woman (\u201cHaidenr\u00f6slein,\u201d heather rose of Goethe). The rose blooms in the \u201crose-garden\u201d of the maiden; therefore, it is also a direct symbol of the libido. When the poet dreams that he is with the rose in the mother-womb of nature, then, psychologically, the fact is that his libido is with the mother. Here is an eternal germination and renewal. We have come across this motive already in the Hierosgamos hymn (Iliad XIV): The nuptials in the blessed West; that is to say, the union in and with the mother. Plutarch shows us this motive in na\u00efve form in his tradition of the Osiris myth; Osiris and Isis copulating in the mother\u2019s womb. This is also perceived by H\u00f6lderlin as the enviable prerogative of the gods\u2014to enjoy everlasting infancy. Thus, in Hyperion, he says:\u201cFateless, like the sleeping nursling,         Breathe the Heavenly ones;         Chastely guarded in modest buds,         Their spirits blossom eternally,         And their quiet eyes         Gaze out in placid         Eternal serenity.\u201d",
