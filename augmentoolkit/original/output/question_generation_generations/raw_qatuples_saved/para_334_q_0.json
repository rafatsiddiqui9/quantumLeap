From that great general sacrifice        Richas and Sama-hymns were born;        Therefrom the metres were produced,        The Yajus had its birth from it.\u201cThe moon was gendered from his mind        And from his eye the Sun had birth;        Indra and Agni from his mouth        Were born, and V\u00e2yu from his breath.\u201cForth from his navel came midair;        The sky was fashioned from his head;        Earth from his feet, and from his ears        The regions. Thus they formed the worlds.\u201dFrom the standpoint of the libido, the term \u201cincest barrier\u201d corresponds to one aspect, but the matter, however, may be considered from another point of view.After this long digression, let us turn back to the song of the Rigveda. Thinking and a conception of the world arose from a shrinking back from stern reality, and it is only after man has regressively assured himself again of the protective parental power[814] that he enters life wrapped in a dream of childhood shrouded in magic superstitions; that is to say, \u201cthinking,\u201d[815] for he, timidly sacrificing his best and assuring himself of the favor of the invisible powers, step by step develops to greater power, in the degree that he frees himself from his retrogressive longing and the original lack of harmony in his being.Rigveda 10, 90, concludes with the exceedingly significant verse, which is of greatest importance for the Christian mysteries as well:\u201cGods, sacrificing, rendered homage to the sacrifice: these were the   earliest holy ordinances, The mighty ones attained the height of heaven, there where the S\u00e2dhyas,   goddesses of old, are dwelling.\u201d",
