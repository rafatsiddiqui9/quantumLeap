- content: 'Text: """The vision of the “throng” develops further; horses emerge; a
    battle is fought. With Silberer, I might accept the significance of this vision
    as belonging, first of all, in the “functional category,” because, fundamentally,
    the conception of the intermingling crowds is nothing but the symbol of the present
    onrush of the mass of thought; likewise the battle, and possibly the horses, which
    illustrate the movement. The deeper significance of the appearance of the horses
    will be seen for the first time in the further course of our treatment of the
    mother symbolism. The following vision has a more definite and significantly important
    character. Miss Miller sees a City of Dreams (“Cité de Rêves”). The picture is
    similar to one she saw a short time before on the cover of a magazine. Unfortunately,
    we learn nothing further about it. One can easily imagine under this “Cité de
    Rêves” a fulfilled wish dream, that is to say, something very beautiful and greatly
    longed for; a sort of heavenly Jerusalem, as the poet of the Apocalypse has dreamed
    it. The city is a maternal symbol, a woman who fosters the inhabitants as children.
    It is, therefore, intelligible that the two mother goddesses, Rhea and Cybele,
    both wear the wall crown. The Old Testament treats the cities of Jerusalem, Babel,
    etc., as women (_Isaiah_ xlvii:1–5):“Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter

    for thou  shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take the millstones and  grind
    meal; uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh,  pass over the
    rivers. That thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy  shame shall be seen;
    sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O  daughter of the Chaldeans; for
    thou shalt no more be called the lady  of the kingdoms.”Jeremiah says of Babel
