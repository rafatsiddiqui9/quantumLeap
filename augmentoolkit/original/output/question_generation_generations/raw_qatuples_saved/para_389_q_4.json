    "paragraph": "The people of this age had grown ripe for identification with the \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (word) \u201cbecome flesh,\u201d for the founding of a new fellowship, united by one idea,[94] in the name of which people could love each other and call each other brothers.[95] The old vague idea of a \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (Messiah), of a mediator in whose name new ways of love would be created, became a fact, and with that humanity made an immense step forward. This had not been brought about by a speculative, completely sophisticated philosophy, but by an elementary need in the mass of people vegetating in spiritual darkness. The profoundest necessities had evidently driven them towards that, since humanity did not thrive in a state of dissoluteness.[96] The meaning of those cults\u2014I speak of Christianity and Mithracism\u2014is clear; it is a moral restraint of animal impulses.[97] The dynamic appearance of both religions betrays something of that enormous feeling of redemption which animated the first disciples and which we to-day scarcely know how to appreciate, for these old truths are empty to us. Most certainly we should still understand it, had our customs even a breath of ancient brutality, for we can hardly realize in this day the whirlwinds of the unchained libido which roared through the ancient Rome of the C\u00e6sars. The civilized man of the present day seems very far removed from that. He has become merely neurotic. So for us the necessities which brought forth Christianity have actually been lost, since we no longer understand their meaning. We do not know against what it had to protect us.[98] For enlightened people, the so-called religiousness has already approached very close to a neurosis. In the past two thousand years Christianity has done its work and has erected barriers of repression, which protect us from the sight of our own \u201csinfulness.\u201d The elementary emotions of the libido have come to be unknown to us, for they are carried on in the unconscious; therefore, ",

    "question": "How has the modern understanding of the necessities that brought about Christianity changed?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that the necessities that led to the establishment of Christianity have been lost in the modern era. Contemporary people no longer understand the meaning behind these necessities because our customs no longer carry the same ancient brutality or the same dynamic feelings of redemption that the original disciples experienced. Modern people have become more neurotic, and the basic emotions of libido are now largely unconscious, leading to a different appreciation of these ancient religious dynamics.",
