    "paragraph": "The hopeful tone, voiced in the \u201cHymn to the God of Creation,\u201d cannot continue very long with our author. The pose simply promises, but does not fulfil. The old longing will come again, for it is a peculiarity of all complexes worked over merely in the unconscious[115] that they lose nothing of their original amount of affect. Meanwhile, their outward manifestations can change almost endlessly. One might therefore consider the first poem as an unconscious longing to solve the conflict through positive religiousness, somewhat in the same manner as they of the earlier centuries decided their conscious conflicts by opposing to them the religious standpoint. This wish does not succeed. Now with the second poem there follows a second attempt which turns out in a decidedly more material way; its thought is unequivocal. Only once \u201chaving gained one raptured glance ...\u201d and then\u2014to die.From the realms of the religious world, the attention, just as in Faust,[116] turns towards the sun of this world, and already there is something mingled with it which has another sense, that is to say, _the moth which fluttered so long around the light that it burnt its wings_.We now pass to that which Miss Miller offers for the better understanding of the poem.

    "question": "What does the author suggest about the \"Hymn to the God of Creation\" and its potential for fulfilling the old longing?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the \"Hymn to the God of Creation\" cannot fully fulfill the old longing. This is because the old longing, which is a complex that has been worked over only in the unconscious, retains its original intensity of affect. Despite the hopeful tone of the poem, its inward manifestations do not change fundamentally.",
