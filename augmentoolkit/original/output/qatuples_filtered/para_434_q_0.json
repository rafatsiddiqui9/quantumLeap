    "paragraph": "\u201cMark how, beneath the evening sunlight\u2019s glow    The green-embosomed houses glitter;    The glow retreats, done is the day of toil,    It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;    Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil    Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!    Then would I see eternal Evening gild    The silent world beneath me glowing....    Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;    The new-born impulse fires my mind,\u2014    I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,    The day before me and the night behind,    Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,\u2014    A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.    Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid    Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.\u201dNot long afterwards, Faust sees \u201cthe black dog roving there through cornfields and stubble,\u201d the dog who is the same as the devil, the tempter, in whose hellish fires Faust has singed his wings. When he believed that he was expressing his great longing for the beauty of the sun and the earth, \u201che went astray thereover\u201d and fell into the hands of \u201cthe Evil One.\u201d\u201cYes, resolute to reach some brighter distance,       On earth\u2019s fair sun I turn my back.\u201dThis is what Faust had said shortly before, in true recognition of the state of affairs. The honoring of the beauty of nature led the Christian of the Middle Ages to pagan thoughts which lay in an antagonistic relation to his conscious religion, just as once Mithracism was in threatening competition with Christianity, for Satan often disguises himself as an angel of light.[108]",
