The sky is his back, the  atmosphere the cavern of his body, the earth the vault of his belly.  The poles are his sides, in between the poles his ribs, the seasons  his limbs, the months and fortnights his joints. Days and nights are  his feet, stars his bones, clouds his flesh. The food he digests is  the deserts, the rivers are his veins, the mountains his liver and  lungs, the herbs and trees his hair; the rising sun is his fore part,  the setting sun his after part. The ocean is his kinsman, the sea his  cradle.\u201d",
