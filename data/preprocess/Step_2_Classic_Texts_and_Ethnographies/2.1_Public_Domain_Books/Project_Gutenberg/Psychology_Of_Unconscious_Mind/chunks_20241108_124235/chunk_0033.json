  "original_text": "We know that, although individuals are widely separated by the\ndifferences in the contents of their consciousness, they are closely\nalike in their unconscious psychology. It is a significant impression\nfor one working in practical psychoanalysis when he realizes how uniform\nare the typical unconscious complexes. Difference first arises from\nindividualization. This fact gives to an essential portion of the\nSchopenhauer and Hartmann philosophies a deep psychologic\njustification.[349] The very evident uniformity of the unconscious\nmechanism serves as a psychologic foundation for these philosophic\nviews. The unconscious contains the differentiated remnants of the\nearlier psychologic functions overcome by the individual\ndifferentiation. The reaction and products of the animal psyche are of a\ngenerally diffused uniformity and solidity, which, among men, may be\ndiscovered apparently only in traces. Man appears as something\nextraordinarily individual in contrast with animals.\n\nThis might be a tremendous delusion, because we have the appropriate\ntendency always to recognize only the difference of things. This is\ndemanded by the psychologic adaptation which, without the most minute\ndifferentiation of the impressions, would be absolutely impossible. In\nopposition to this tendency we have ever the greatest difficulty in\nrecognizing in their common relations the things with which we are\noccupied in every-day life. This recognition becomes much easier with\nthings which are more remote from us. For example, it is almost\nimpossible for a European to differentiate the faces in a Chinese\nthrong, although the Chinese have just as individual facial formations\nas the Europeans, but the similarity of their strange facial expression\nis much more evident to the remote onlooker than their individual\ndifferences. But when we live among the Chinese then the impression of\ntheir uniformity disappears more and more, and finally the Chinese\nbecome individuals also. Individuality belongs to those conditional\nactualities which are greatly overrated theoretically on account of\ntheir practical significance. It does not belong to those overwhelmingly\nclear and therefore universally obtrusive general facts upon which a\nscience must primarily be founded. The individual content of\nconsciousness is, therefore, the most unfavorable object imaginable for\npsychology, because it has veiled the universally valid until it has\nbecome unrecognizable. The essence of consciousness is the process of\nadaptation which takes place in the most minute details. On the other\nhand, the unconscious is the generally diffused, which not only binds\nthe individuals among themselves to the race, but also unites them\nbackwards with the peoples of the past and their psychology. Thus the\nunconscious, surpassing the individual in its generality, is, in the\nfirst place, the object of a true psychology, which claims not to be\npsychophysical.\n\nMan as an individual is a suspicious phenomenon, the right of whose\nexistence from a natural biological standpoint could be seriously\ncontested, because, from this point of view, the individual is only a\nrace atom, and has a significance only as a mass constituent. The\nethical standpoint, however, gives to the human being an individual\ntendency separating him from the mass, which, in the course of\ncenturies, led to the development of personality, hand in hand with\nwhich developed the hero cult, and has led to the modern individualistic\ncult of personages. The attempts of rationalistic theology to keep hold\nof the personal Jesus as the last and most precious remnant of the\ndivinity which has vanished beyond the power of the imagination\ncorresponds to this tendency. In this respect the Roman Catholic Church\nwas more practical, because she met the general need of the visible, or\nat least historically believed hero, through the fact that she placed\nupon the throne of worship a small but clearly perceptible god of the\nworld, namely, the Roman Pope, the Pater patrum, and at the same time\nthe Pontifex Maximus of the invisible upper or inner God. The sensuous\ndemonstrability of God naturally supports the religious process of\nintroversion, because the human figure essentially facilitates the\ntransference, for it is not easy to imagine something lovable or\nvenerable in a spiritual being. This tendency, everywhere present, has\nbeen secretly preserved in the rationalistic theology with its Jesus\nhistorically insisted upon. This does not mean that men loved the\nvisible God; they love him, not as he is, for he is merely a man, and\nwhen the pious wished to love humanity they could go to their neighbors\nand their enemies to love them. Mankind wishes to love in God only their\nideas, that is to say, the ideas which they project into God. By that\nthey wish to love their unconscious, that is, that remnant of ancient\nhumanity and the centuries-old past in all people, namely, the common\nproperty left behind from all development which is given to all men,\nlike the sunshine and the air. But in loving this inheritance they love\nthat which is common to all. Thus they turn back to the mother of\nhumanity, that is to say, to the spirit of the race, and regain in this\nway something of that connection and of that mysterious and irresistible\npower which is imparted by the feeling of belonging to the herd. It is\nthe problem of Antæus, who preserves his gigantic strength only through\ncontact with mother earth. This temporary withdrawal into one’s self,\nwhich, as we have already seen, signifies a regression to the childish\nbond to the parent, seems to act favorably, within certain limits, in\nits effect upon the psychologic condition of the individual. It is in\ngeneral to be expected that the two fundamental mechanisms of the\npsychoses, transference and introversion, are to a wide extent extremely\nappropriate methods of normal reaction against complexes; transference\nas a means of escaping from the complex into reality; introversion as a\nmeans of detaching one’s self from reality through the complex.\n\nAfter we have informed ourselves about the general purposes of prayer,\nwe are prepared to hear more about the vision of our dreamer. After the\nprayer, “the head of a sphinx with an Egyptian headdress” appeared, only\nto vanish quickly. Here the author was disturbed, so that for a moment\nshe awoke. This vision recalls the previously mentioned phantasy of the\nEgyptian statue, whose rigid gesture is entirely in place here as a\nphenomenon of the so-called functional category. The light stages of the\nhypnosis are designated technically as “Engourdissement” (stiffening).\nThe word Sphinx in the whole civilized world signifies the same as\nriddle: a puzzling creature who proposes riddles, like the Sphinx of\nOedipus, standing at the portal of his fate like a symbolic proclamation\nof the inevitable. The Sphinx is a semi-theriomorphic representation of\nthat “mother image” which may be designated as the “terrible mother,” of\nwhom many traces are found in mythology. This interpretation is correct\nfor Oedipus. Here the question is opened. The objection will be raised\nthat nothing except the word “Sphinx” justifies the allusion to the\nSphinx of Oedipus. On account of the lack of subjective materials, which\nin the Miller text are wholly lacking in regard to this vision, an\nindividual interpretation would also be excluded. The suggestion of an\n“Egyptian” phantasy (Part I, Chapter II) is entirely insufficient to be\nemployed here. Therefore we are compelled, if we wish to venture at all\nupon an understanding of this vision, to direct ourselves—perhaps in all\ntoo daring a manner—to the available ethnographic material under the\nassumption that the unconscious of the present-day man coins its symbols\nas was done in the most remote past. The Sphinx, in its traditional\nform, is a half-human, half-animal creature, which we must, in part,\ninterpret in the way that is applicable to such phantastic products. The\nreader is directed to the deductions in the first part of this volume\nwhere the theriomorphic representations of the libido were discussed.\nThis manner of representation is very familiar to the analyst, through\nthe dreams and phantasies of neurotics (and of normal men). The impulse\nis readily represented as an animal, as a bull, horse, dog, etc. One of\nmy patients, who had questionable relations with women, and who began\nthe treatment with the fear, so to speak, that I would surely forbid him\nhis sexual adventures, dreamed that I (his physician) very skilfully\nspeared to the wall a strange animal, half pig, half crocodile. Dreams\nswarm with such theriomorphic representations of the libido. Mixed\nbeings, such as are in this dream, are not rare. A series of very\nbeautiful illustrations, where especially the lower half of the animal\nwas represented theriomorphically, has been furnished by\nBertschinger.[350] The libido which was represented theriomorphically is\nthe “animal” sexuality which is in a repressed state. The history of\nrepression, as we have seen, goes back to the incest problem, where the\nfirst motives for moral resistance against sexuality display themselves.\nThe objects of the repressed libido are, in the last degree, the images\nof father and mother; therefore the theriomorphic symbols, in so far as\nthey do not symbolize merely the libido in general, have a tendency to\npresent father and mother (for example, father represented by a bull,\nmother by a cow). From these roots, as we pointed out earlier, might\nprobably arise the theriomorphic attributes of the Divinity. In as far\nas the repressed libido manifests itself under certain conditions, as\nanxiety, these animals are generally of a horrible nature. In\nconsciousness we are attached by all sacred bonds to the mother; in the\ndream she pursues us as a terrible animal. The Sphinx, mythologically\nconsidered, is actually a fear animal, which reveals distinct traits of\na mother derivate. In the Oedipus legend the Sphinx is sent by Hera, who\nhates Thebes on account of the birth of Bacchus; because Oedipus\nconquers the Sphinx, which is nothing but fear of the mother, he must\nmarry Jocasta, his mother, for the throne and the hand of the widowed\nqueen of Thebes belonged to him who freed the land from the plague of\nthe Sphinx. The genealogy of the Sphinx is rich in allusions to the\nproblem touched upon here. She is a daughter of Echnida, a mixed being;\na beautiful maiden above, a hideous serpent below. This double creature\ncorresponds to the picture of the mother; above, the human, lovely and\nattractive half; below, the horrible animal half, converted into a fear\nanimal through the incest prohibition. Echnida is derived from the\nAll-mother, the mother Earth, Gaea, who, with Tartaros, the personified\nunderworld (the place of horrors), brought her forth. Echnida herself is\nthe mother of all terrors, of the Chimaera, Scylla, Gorgo, of the\nhorrible Cerberus, of the Nemean Lion, and of the eagle who devoured the\nliver of Prometheus; besides this she gave birth to a number of dragons.\nOne of her sons is Orthrus, the dog of the monstrous Geryon, who was\nkilled by Hercules. With this dog, her son, Echnida, in incestuous\nintercourse, produced the Sphinx. These materials will suffice to\ncharacterize that amount of libido which led to the Sphinx symbol. If,\nin spite of the lack of subjective material, we may venture to draw an\ninference from the Sphinx symbol of our author, we must say that the\nSphinx represents an original incestuous amount of libido detached from\nthe bond to the mother. Perhaps it is better to postpone this conclusion\nuntil we have examined the following visions.\n\nAfter Miss Miller had concentrated herself again, the vision developed\nfurther:\n\n  “Suddenly an Aztec appeared, absolutely clear in every detail; the\n  hands spread open, with large fingers, the head in profile, armored,\n  headdress similar to the feather ornaments of the American Indian. The\n  whole was somewhat suggestive of Mexican sculpture.”\n\nThe ancient Egyptian character of the Sphinx is replaced here by\nAmerican antiquity—by the Aztec. The essential idea is neither Egypt nor\nMexico, for the two could not be interchanged; but it is the subjective\nfactor which the dreamer produces from her own past. I have frequently\nobserved in the analysis of Americans that certain unconscious\ncomplexes, i.e. repressed sexuality, are represented by the symbol of a\nNegro or an Indian; for example, when a European tells in his dream,\n“Then came a ragged, dirty individual,” for Americans and for those who\nlive in the tropics it is a Negro. When with Europeans it is a vagabond\nor a criminal, with Americans it is a Negro or an Indian which\nrepresents the individual’s own repressed sexual personality, and the\none considered inferior. It is also desirable to go into the particulars\nof this vision, as there are various things worthy of notice. The\nfeather cap, which naturally had to consist of eagles’ feathers, is a\nsort of magic charm. The hero assumes at the same time something of the\nsun-like character of this bird when he adorns himself with its\nfeathers, just as the courage and strength of the enemy are appropriated\nin swallowing his heart or taking his scalp. At the same time, the\nfeather crest is a crown which is equivalent to the rays of the sun. The\nhistorical importance of the Sun identification has been seen in the\nfirst part.[351]",
