Love is a blind             Fisherwoman;             Tell the child             Where to seize.           Already it leaps in my hands.Oh, Pity, or delight!           With nestlings and turnings             It coils on my breast,             It bites me, oh, wonder!             Boldly through the skin,             It darts under my heart.           Oh, Love, I shudder!What can I do, what can I begin?             That shuddering thing;             There it crackles within             And coils in a ring.             It must be poisoned.             Here it crawls around.             Blissfully I feel as it worms             Itself into my soul             And kills me finally.All these things are simple, and need no explanation to be intelligible. Somewhat more complicated, but still unmistakable, is the dream of a woman; she sees the triumphal arch of Constantine. A cannon stands before it, to the right of it a bird, to the left a man. A shot flashes out of the tube; the projectile hits her; it goes into her pocket, into her purse. There it remains, and she holds her purse as if something very precious were in it. The image disappears, and she continues to see only the stock of the cannon, and over that Constantine\u2019s motto, \u201cIn hoc signo vinces.\u201d",

    "question": "Describe the dream that the woman in the second stanza experiences.",
    "answer": "The woman in the dream sees a triumphal arch of Constantine with a cannon standing before it. To the right of the cannon is a bird, and to the left is a man. A shot is fired from the cannon, and the projectile hits the woman, entering her pocket or purse. The projectile remains inside, and the woman holds her purse as if something very precious were in it. This dream image then disappears, and she continues to see only the stock of the cannon and Constantine\u2019s motto, \"In hoc signo vinces.\"",
