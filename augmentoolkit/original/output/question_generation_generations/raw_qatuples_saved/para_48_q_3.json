    "paragraph": "Eternity is in thy years,   Unborn, undying beauty in thine eyes;   With me thou canst not sympathize,   Except in love, and there thou must   Acknowledge that more loving dust   Ne\u2019er wept beneath the skies.   Thou walkest thy many worlds,[196] thou seest   The face of him who made thee great,   As he hath made of me the least   Of those cast out from Eden\u2019s gate;Yet, Seraph, dear!        Oh hear!   For thou hast loved me, and I would not die   Until I know what I must die in knowing,   That thou forgettest in thine eternity   Her whose heart death could not keep from o\u2019erflowing   For thee, immortal essence as thou art,[197]   Great is their love who love in sin and fear;   And such, I feel, are waging in my heart   A war unworthy: to an Adamite   Forgive, my Seraph! that such thoughts appear.   For sorrow is our element....\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7The hour is near   Which tells me we are not abandoned quite.     Appear! Appear!     Seraph!

There is a ray[199]   In me, which though forbidden yet to shine,   I feel was lighted at thy God\u2019s and mine.[200]   It may be hidden long: death and decay   Our mother Eve bequeathed us\u2014but my heart   Defies it: though this life must pass away,   Is that a cause for thee and me to part?\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7",

    "question": "How does the speaker contrast their own nature with the Seraph's?",
    "answer": "The speaker contrasts their own nature with the Seraph's by referring to themselves as \"formed of clay\" and the Seraph as \"of beams / More bright than those of day on Eden\u2019s streams.\" This implies that while the speaker is mortal and imperfect, the Seraph is immortal and more enlightened, yet the speaker still values their love deeply.",
