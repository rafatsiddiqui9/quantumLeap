    "paragraph": "\u201cAye, thou art far away, O holy countenance! And the melody of thy life is kept from me, No longer overheard. And, ah, where are Thy magic songs which once soothed my heart With the peace of Heaven? How long it is, how long! The youth is aged; the very earth itself, which once smiled on me, Has grown different.\u201cOh, farewell!
