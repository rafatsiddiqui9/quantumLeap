    "question": "How does the analysis of the Aztec figure contribute to understanding the symbolism of the mother and her role in the unconscious?",
    "answer": "The analysis of the Aztec figure, including its hand symbol, provides insight into the maternal symbolism in the unconscious. The hand can symbolize protective or nurturing qualities, and the Aztec figure serves as a substitute for the Sphinx, reinforcing the idea that maternal figures can represent both protection and fear in the unconscious.",
