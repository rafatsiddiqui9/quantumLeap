    of the world. They created or produced the world by making it come forth from
    the rectum, just as the egg of birds originates in the egg canal. One of these
    two artists was endowed with a true artistic sense. He painted a picture in which
    he was just in the act of creation; the world came forth from his anus; the membrum
    was in full erection; he was naked, surrounded by women, and with all insignia
    of his power. The excrement is in a certain sense the thing wished for, and on
    that account it receives the corresponding valuation. When I first understood
    this connection, an observation made long ago, and which disturbed me greatly
    because I never rightly understood it, became clear to me. It concerned an educated
    patient who, under very tragic circumstances, had to be separated from her husband
    and child, and was brought into the insane asylum. She exhibited a typical apathy
    and slovenliness which was considered as affective mental deterioration. Even
    at that time I doubted this deterioration, and was inclined to regard it as a
    secondary adjustment. I took especial pains to ascertain how I could discover
    the existence of the affect in this case. Finally, after more than three hours’
    hard work, I succeeded in finding a train of thought which suddenly brought the
