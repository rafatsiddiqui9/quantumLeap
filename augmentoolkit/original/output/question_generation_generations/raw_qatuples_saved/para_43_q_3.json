    "paragraph": "Brunhilde is also somewhat the \u201cangel of the face,\u201d that creative will or word,[698] emanating from God, also the Logos, which became the child-bearing woman. God created the world through his word; that is to say, his mother, the woman who is to bring him forth again. (He lays his own egg.) This peculiar conception, it seems to me, can be explained by assuming that the libido overflowing into speech (thought) has preserved its sexual character to an extraordinary degree as a result of the inherent inertia. In this way the \u201cword\u201d had to execute and fulfil all that was denied to the sexual wish; namely, the return into the mother, in order to attain eternal duration. The \u201cword\u201d fulfils this wish by itself becoming the daughter, the wife, the mother of the God, who brings him forth anew.[699]Wagner has this idea vaguely in his mind in Wotan\u2019s lament over Brunhilde:\u201cNone as she knew my inmost thought;          None knew the source of my will          As she;          She herself was          The creating womb of my wish;          And so now she has broken          The blessed union!\u201dBrunhilde\u2019s sin is the favoring of Siegmund, but, behind this, lies incest: this is projected into the brother-sister relation of Siegmund and Sieglinde; in reality, and archaically expressed, Wotan, the father, has entered into his self-created daughter, in order to rejuvenate himself. But this fact must, of course, be veiled. Wotan is rightly indignant with Brunhilde, for she has taken the Isis r\u00f4le and through the birth of the son has deprived the old man of his power. The first attack of the death serpent in the form of the son, Siegmund, Wotan has repelled; he has broken Siegmund\u2019s sword, but Siegmund rises again in a grandson. This inevitable fate is always helped by the woman; hence the wrath of Wotan.",

    "question": "What does the author imply about Brunhilde's sin and the incestuous relationship?",
    "answer": "The author implies that Brunhilde's sin involves favoring Siegmund, which is rooted in an archaic incestuous relationship. This incest is symbolically projected into the brother-sister relation of Siegmund and Sieglinde. In reality, Wotan, the father, has indirectly engaged in incest by entering into his self-created daughter to rejuvenate himself. However, this relationship must be veiled to maintain cultural and ethical norms.",
