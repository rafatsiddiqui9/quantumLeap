    "paragraph": "Stretched out, shivering      Like one half dead whose feet are warmed,      Shaken alas! by unknown fevers,      Trembling from the icy pointed arrows of frost,      Hunted by Thee, O Thought!      Unutterable! Veiled! Horrible One!      Thou huntsman behind the clouds!      Struck to the ground by thee,      Thou mocking eye that gazeth at me from the dark!      \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Thus do I lie      Bending, writhing, tortured      With all eternal tortures,      Smitten      By thee, crudest huntsman,      Thou unfamiliar God.Smite deeper!      Smite once more:      Pierce through and rend my heart!      What meaneth this torturing      With blunt-toothed arrows?      Why gazeth thou again,      Never weary of human pain,      With malicious, God-lightning eyes,      Thou wilt not kill,      But torture, torture?No long-drawn-out explanation is necessary to enable us to recognize in this comparison the old, universal idea of the martyred sacrifice of God, which we have met previously in the Mexican sacrifice of the cross and in the sacrifice of Odin.[609] This same conception faces us in the oft-repeated martyrdom of St. Sebastian, where, in the delicate-glowing flesh of the young god, all the pain of renunciation which has been felt by the artist has been portrayed. An artist always embodies in his artistic work a portion of the mysteries of his time. In a heightened degree the same is true of the principal Christian symbol, the crucified one pierced by the lance, the conception of the man of the Christian era tormented by his wishes, crucified and dying in Christ.",

    "question": "What does the speaker request from this entity?",
    "answer": "The speaker requests to be struck deeper and once more, and even pleads for the entity to pierce through and rend their heart. They express a desire for the torturing to continue and question the meaning of the blunt-toothed arrows used to cause pain.",
