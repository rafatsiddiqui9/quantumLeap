    "paragraph": "\u201cThou waterest her furrows: thou sendest rain into the little valleys  thereof; thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the  increase of it.\u201cThou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop  fatness.\u201dWherever the fertilizing God steps, there is fruitfulness. We already have spoken of the symbolic meaning of treading in discussing the nightmares. Kaineus passes into the depths, \u201csplitting the earth with a foot outstretched.\u201d Amphiaraus, another chthonic hero, sinks into the earth, which Zeus has opened for him by a stroke of lightning. (Compare with that the above-mentioned vision of a hysterical patient, who saw a black horse after a flash of lightning: identity of horse\u2019s footstep and flash of lightning.) By means of a flash of lightning heroes were made immortal.[633] Faust attained the mothers when he stamped his foot.\u201cStamp and descend, stamping thou\u2019lt rise again.\u201dThe heroes in the sun-devouring myths often stamp at or struggle in the jaws of the monster. Thus Tor stamped through the ship\u2019s bottom in battle with the monster, and _went as far as the bottom of the sea_. (Kaineus.) (Concerning \u201ckicking\u201d as an infantile phantasy, see above.) The regression of the libido to the presexual stage makes this preparatory action of treading either a substitution for the coitus phantasy or for the phantasy of re-entrance into the mother\u2019s womb. The comparison of water flowing from the footsteps with a comet is a light symbolism for the fructifying moisture (sperma). According to an observation by Humboldt (Kosmos), certain South American Indian tribes call the meteors \u201curine of the stars.\u201d Mention is also made of how Gitche Manito makes fire. He blows upon a forest, so that the trees, rubbing upon each other, burst into flame. This demon is, therefore, an excellent libido symbol; he also produced fire.",

    "question": "How are the actions of heroes in sun-devouring myths, such as Tor, connected to the symbolism of treading and fruitfulness?",
    "answer": "Heroes in sun-devouring myths often stamp or struggle within the jaws of a monster, which is a symbolic act related to treading and fruitfulness. For example, Tor is described as stamping through the ship\u2019s bottom in battle with a monster and \"going as far as the bottom of the sea.\" These actions symbolize a deep and transformative act that leads to greater fruitfulness and life, reflecting the broader symbolic meaning of treading as a life-giving and fertilizing force.",
