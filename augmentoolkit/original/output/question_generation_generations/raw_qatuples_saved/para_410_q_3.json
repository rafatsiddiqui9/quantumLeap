    "paragraph": "In Miss Miller\u2019s phantasy there is internal compulsion, in that she passes from the horse sacrifice to the self-sacrifice of the hero. Whereas the first symbolizes renunciation of the sexual wishes, the second has the deeper and ethically more valuable meaning of the sacrifice of the infantile personality. The object of psychoanalysis has frequently been wrongly understood to mean the renunciation or the gratification of the ordinary sexual wish, while, in reality, the problem is the sublimation of the infantile personality, or, expressed mythologically, a sacrifice and rebirth of the infantile hero.[847] In the Christian mysteries, however, the resurrected one becomes a supermundane spirit, and the invisible kingdom of God, with its mysterious gifts, are obtained by his believers through the sacrifice of himself on the mother. In psychoanalysis the infantile personality is deprived of its libido fixations in a rational manner; the libido which is thus set free serves for the building up of a personality matured and adapted to reality, who does willingly and without complaint everything required by necessity. (It is, so to speak, the chief endeavor of the infantile personality to struggle against all necessities and to create coercions for itself where none exist in reality.)[Illustration: PRIAPUS AND SERPENT]This apparent contrast in the nature of the libido is strikingly illustrated by a Priapic statuette in the antique collection at Verona.[852] Priapus smilingly points with his finger to a snake biting off his \u201cmembrum.\u201d He carries a basket on his arm, filled with oblong objects, probably phalli, evidently prepared as substitutes.",

    "question": "How does the author illustrate the apparent contrast in the nature of the libido?",
    "answer": "The author illustrates the apparent contrast in the nature of the libido through a Priapic statuette in the antique collection at Verona. The statuette shows Priapus smilingly pointing with his finger to a snake biting off his \"membrum.\" He carries a basket on his arm, filled with oblong objects, probably phalli, which are likely prepared as substitutes. This statuette symbolizes the contrasting nature of the libido, where it can both represent desire and its repression or sacrifice.",
