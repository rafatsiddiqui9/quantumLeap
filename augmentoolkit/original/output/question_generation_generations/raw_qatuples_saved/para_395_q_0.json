After all the preceding materials, it can no longer be difficult to recognize in the Christian mysteries the human sacrifice, or the sacrifice of the son to the mother.[842] Just as Attis emasculates himself on account of the mother, so does Christ himself hang upon the tree of life,[843] the wood of martyrdom, the \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7,[844] the chthonic mother, and by that redeems creation from death.
