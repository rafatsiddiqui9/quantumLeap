    "paragraph": "The conflict is produced by some important task or duty which is essential biologically and practically for the fulfilment of the ego of the individual, but before which an obstacle arises from which he shrinks, and thus halted cannot go on. With this interference in the path of progression libido is stored up and a _regression_ takes place whereby there occurs a reanimation of past ways of libido occupation which were entirely normal to the child, but which for the adult are no longer of value. These regressive infantile desires and phantasies now alive and striving for satisfaction are converted into symptoms, and in these surrogate forms obtain a certain gratification, thus creating the external manifestations of the neurosis. Therefore Jung does not ask from what psychic experience or point of fixation in childhood the patient is suffering, but what is the present duty or task he is avoiding, or what obstacle in his life\u2019s path he is unable to overcome? What is the cause of his regression to past psychic experiences?Following this theory Jung expresses the view that the elaborate phantasies and dreams produced by these patients are really forms of compensation or artificial substitutes for the unfulfilled adaptation to reality. The sexual content of these phantasies and dreams is only apparently and not actually expressive of a real sexual desire or incest wish, but is a regressive employment of sexual forms to symbolically express a present-day need when the attainment of the present ego demand seems too difficult or impossible, and no adaptation is made to what is possible for the individual\u2019s capability.[3]",

These sexual forms do not necessarily express real sexual desires or incest wishes but serve as a regressive employment to symbolically express present-day needs. When a patient's current ego demand seems too challenging, these symbolic expressions help them cope by providing a form of gratification that is not possible in their\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e7b\u60f3\u548c\u68a6\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u8868\u8fbe\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u6b32\u6216\u4e71\u4f26\u613f\u671b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8c61\u5f81\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u60a3\u8005\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002",
