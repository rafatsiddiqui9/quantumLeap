A sudden terror and suspicion against that which\n  it has loved, a lightning flash of scorn towards that which is called\n  ‘duty,’ a rebellious, arbitrary, volcanic, impelling desire for\n  travelling, for strange countries, estrangements, coolness, frigidity,\n  disillusionments, a hatred of love, perhaps a sacrilegious touch and\n  glance backwards[630] there where just now it adored and loved,\n  perhaps a blush of shame over what it has just done, and at the same\n  time an exultation over having done it, an intoxicating internal\n  joyous thrill, in which a victory reveals itself—a victory? Over what?\n  Over whom? An enigmatic, doubtful, questioning victory, but the first\n  triumph. Of such woe and pain is formed the history of the great\n  detachment. It is like a disease which can destroy men,—this first\n  eruption of strength and will towards self-assertion.”[631]\n\nThe danger lies, as is brilliantly expressed by Nietzsche, in isolation\nin one’s self:\n\n  “Solitude surrounds and embraces him ever more threatening, ever more\n  constricting, ever more heart-strangling, the terrible Goddess and\n  Mater sæva cupidinum.”\n\nThe libido taken away from the mother, who is abandoned only\nreluctantly, becomes threatening as a serpent, the symbol of death, for\nthe relation to the mother must cease, _must die, which itself almost\ncauses man’s death_. In “Mater sæva cupidinum” the idea attains rare,\nalmost conscious, perfection.\n\nI do not presume to try to paint in better words than has Nietzsche the\npsychology of the wrench from childhood.\n\n\nMiss Miller furnishes us with a further reference to a material which\nhas influenced her creation in a more general manner; this is the great\nIndian epic of Longfellow, “The Song of Hiawatha.”\n\nIf my readers have had patience to read thus far, and to reflect upon\nwhat they have read, they frequently must have wondered at the number of\ntimes I introduce for comparison such apparently foreign material and\nhow often I widen the base upon which Miss Miller’s creations rest.\nDoubts must often have arisen whether it is justifiable to enter into\nimportant discussions concerning the psychologic foundations of myths,\nreligions and culture in general on the basis of such scanty\nsuggestions. It might be said that behind the Miller phantasies such a\nthing is scarcely to be found. I need hardly emphasize the fact that I,\ntoo, have sometimes been in doubt. I had never read “Hiawatha” until, in\nthe course of my work, I came to this part. “Hiawatha,” a poetical\ncompilation of Indian myths, gives me, however, a justification for all\npreceding reflections, because this epic contains an unusual number of\nmythologic problems. This fact is probably of great importance for the\nwealth of suggestions in the Miller phantasies. We are, therefore,\ncompelled to obtain an insight into this epic.\n\nNawadaha sings the songs of the epic of the hero Hiawatha, the friend of\nman:\n\n                 “There he sang of Hiawatha,\n                 Sang the songs of Hiawatha,\n                 Sang his wondrous birth and being,\n                 How he prayed and how he fasted,\n                 How he lived and toiled and suffered,\n                 That the tribes of men might prosper,\n                 That he might advance his people.”\n\nThe teleological meaning of the hero, as that symbolic figure which\nunites in itself libido in the form of admiration and adoration, in\norder to lead to higher sublimations by way of the symbolic bridges of\nthe myths, is anticipated here. Thus we become quickly acquainted with\nHiawatha as a savior, and are prepared to hear all that which must be\nsaid of a savior, of his marvellous birth, of his early great deeds, and\nhis sacrifice for his fellow-men.\n\nThe first song begins with a fragment of evangelism: Gitche Manito, the\n“master of life,” tired of the quarrels of his human children, calls his\npeople together and makes known to them the joyous message:\n\n                “I will send a prophet to you,\n                A Deliverer of the nations,\n                Who shall guide you and shall teach you,\n                Who shall toil and suffer with you.\n                If you listen to his counsels,\n                You will multiply and prosper.\n                If his warnings pass unheeded,\n                You will fade away and perish!”\n\nGitche Manito, the Mighty, “the creator of the nations,” is represented\nas he stood erect “on the great Red Pipestone quarry.”\n\n                  “From his footprints flowed a river,\n                  Leaped into the light of morning,\n                  O’er the precipice plunging downward\n                  Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.”\n\nThe water flowing from his footsteps sufficiently proves the phallic\nnature of this creator. I refer to the earlier utterances concerning the\nphallic and fertilizing nature of the horse’s foot and the horse’s\nsteps, and especially do I recall Hippocrene and the foot of\nPegasus.[632] We meet with the same idea in Psalm lxv, vv. 9 to 11:\n\n  “Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it; thou makest it very\n  plenteous.\n\n  “The river of God is full of water; thou preparest their corn, for so\n  thou providest for the earth.\n\n  “Thou waterest her furrows: thou sendest rain into the little valleys\n  thereof; thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the\n  increase of it.\n\n  “Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop\n  fatness.”\n\nWherever the fertilizing God steps, there is fruitfulness. We already\nhave spoken of the symbolic meaning of treading in discussing the\nnightmares. Kaineus passes into the depths, “splitting the earth with a\nfoot outstretched.” Amphiaraus, another chthonic hero, sinks into the\nearth, which Zeus has opened for him by a stroke of lightning. (Compare\nwith that the above-mentioned vision of a hysterical patient, who saw a\nblack horse after a flash of lightning: identity of horse’s footstep and\nflash of lightning.) By means of a flash of lightning heroes were made\nimmortal.[633] Faust attained the mothers when he stamped his foot.\n\n  “Stamp and descend, stamping thou’lt rise again.”\n\nThe heroes in the sun-devouring myths often stamp at or struggle in the\njaws of the monster. Thus Tor stamped through the ship’s bottom in\nbattle with the monster, and _went as far as the bottom of the sea_.\n(Kaineus.) (Concerning “kicking” as an infantile phantasy, see above.)\nThe regression of the libido to the presexual stage makes this\npreparatory action of treading either a substitution for the coitus\nphantasy or for the phantasy of re-entrance into the mother’s womb. The\ncomparison of water flowing from the footsteps with a comet is a light\nsymbolism for the fructifying moisture (sperma). According to an\nobservation by Humboldt (Kosmos), certain South American Indian tribes\ncall the meteors “urine of the stars.” Mention is also made of how\nGitche Manito makes fire. He blows upon a forest, so that the trees,\nrubbing upon each other, burst into flame. This demon is, therefore, an\nexcellent libido symbol; he also produced fire.\n\nAfter this prologue in the second song, the hero’s previous history is\nrelated. The great warrior, Mudjekeewis (Hiawatha’s father), has\ncunningly overcome the great bear, “the terror of the nations,” and\nstolen from him the magic “belt of wampum,” a girdle of shells. Here we\nmeet the motive of the “treasure attained with difficulty,” which the\nhero rescues from the monster. Who the bear is, is shown by the poet’s\ncomparisons. Mudjekeewis strikes the bear on his head after he has\nrobbed him of the treasure.\n\n                 “With the heavy blow bewildered\n                 Rose the great Bear of the mountains,\n                 But his knees beneath him trembled,\n                 And he whimpered _like a woman_.”\n\nMudjekeewis said derisively to him:\n\n                 “Else you would not cry, and whimper,\n                 Like a _miserable woman_!\n\n                        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n                 But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,\n                 And disgrace your tribe by crying,\n                 Like a wretched Shaugodaya,\n                 Like a _cowardly old woman_!”\n\nThese three comparisons with a woman are to be found near each other on\nthe same page. Mudjekeewis has, like a true hero, once more torn life\nfrom the jaws of death, from the all-devouring “terrible mother.” This\ndeed, which, as we have seen, is also represented as a journey to hell,\n“night journey through the sea,” the conquering of the monster from\nwithin, signifies at the same time entrance into the mother’s womb, a\nrebirth, the results of which are perceptible also for Mudjekeewis. As\nin the Zosimos vision, here too the entering one becomes the breath of\nthe wind or spirit. Mudjekeewis becomes the west wind, the fertilizing\nbreath, the father of winds.[634] His sons become the other winds. An\nintermezzo tells of them and of their love stories, of which I will\nmention only the courtship of Wabuns, the East Wind, because here the\nerotic wooing of the wind is pictured in an especially beautiful manner.\nEvery morning he sees a beautiful girl in a meadow, whom he eagerly\ncourts:\n\n                 “Every morning, gazing earthward,\n                 Still the first thing he beheld there\n                 Was her blue eyes looking at him,\n                 Two blue lakes among the rushes.”\n\nThe comparison with water is not a matter of secondary importance,\nbecause “from wind and water” shall man be born anew.\n\n                “And he wooed her with caresses,\n                Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,\n                With his flattering words he wooed her,\n                With his sighing and his singing,\n                Gentlest whispers in the branches,\n                Softest music, sweetest odors,” etc.\n\nIn these onomatopoetic verses the wind’s caressing courtship is\nexcellently expressed.[635]\n\nThe third song presents the previous history of Hiawatha’s mother. His\ngrandmother, when a maiden, lived in the moon. There she once swung upon\na liana, but a jealous lover cut off the liana, and Nokomis, Hiawatha’s\ngrandmother, fell to earth. The people, who saw her fall downwards,\nthought that she was a _shooting star_. This marvellous descent of\nNokomis is more plainly illustrated by a later passage of this same\nsong; there little Hiawatha asks the grandmother what is the moon.\nNokomis teaches him about it as follows: The moon is the body of a\n_grandmother_, whom a warlike grandson has cast up there in wrath. Hence\nthe moon is the _grandmother_. In ancient beliefs, the moon is also the\ngathering place of departed souls,[636] the guardian of seeds;\ntherefore, once more a place of the origin of life of predominantly\nfeminine significance. The remarkable thing is that Nokomis, falling\nupon the earth, gave birth to a daughter, Wenonah, subsequently the\nmother of Hiawatha. The throwing upwards of the mother, and her falling\ndown and bringing forth, seems to contain something typical in itself.\nThus a story of the seventeenth century relates that a mad bull threw a\npregnant woman as high as a house, and tore open her womb, and the child\nfell without harm upon the earth. On account of his wonderful birth,\nthis child was considered a hero or doer of miracles, but he died at an\nearly age. The belief is widespread among lower savages that the sun is\nfeminine and the moon masculine. Among the Namaqua, a Hottentot tribe,\nthe opinion is prevalent that the sun consists of transparent bacon.\n\n  “The people, who journey on boats, draw it down by magic every\n  evening, cut off a suitable piece and then give it _a kick so that it\n  flies up again into the sky_.”—_Waitz_: “Anthropologie,” II, 342.",
