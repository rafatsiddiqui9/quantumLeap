    "paragraph": "In this quotation we come upon the symbol of the waters, which we found in the mention of Ogyges in connection with the city. The maternal significance of water belongs to the clearest symbolism in the realm of mythology,[440] so that the ancients could say: \u1f20 \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u2014\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd.[441] From water comes life;[442] therefore, of the two gods which here interest us the most, Christ and Mithra, the latter was born beside a river, according to representations, while Christ experienced his new birth in the Jordan; moreover, he is born from the \u03a0\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae,[443] the \u201csempiterni fons amoris,\u201d the mother of God, who by the heathen-Christian legend was made a nymph of the Spring. The \u201cSpring\u201d is also found in Mithracism. A Pannonian dedication reads, \u201cFonti perenni.\u201d An inscription in Apulia is dedicated to the \u201cFons Aeterni.\u201d In Persia, Ardv\u00ee\u00e7\u00fbra is the well of the water of life. Ardv\u00ee\u00e7\u00fbra-Anahita is a goddess of water and love (just as Aphrodite is born from foam). The neo-Persians designate the Planet Venus and a nubile girl by the name \u201cNahid.\u201d In the temples of Anaitis there existed prostitute Hierodules (harlots). In the Sakaeen (in honor of Anaitis) there, occurred ritual combats as in the festival of the Egyptian Ares and his mother. In the Vedas the waters are called M\u00e2tritam\u00e2h\u2014the most maternal.[443] All that is living rises as does the sun, from the water, and at evening plunges into the water. Born from the springs, the rivers, the seas, at death man arrives at the waters of the Styx in order to enter upon the \u201cnight journey on the sea.\u201d The wish is that the black water of death might be the water of life; that death, with its cold embrace, might be the mother\u2019s womb, just as the sea devours the sun, but brings it forth again out of the maternal womb (Jonah motive[444]). Life believes not in death.",

    "question": "How is the maternal significance of water illustrated in the birth narratives of Christ and Mithra?",
    "answer": "In the birth narratives of Christ and Mithra, water is significant. Mithra was born beside a river according to representations, while Christ experienced his new birth in the Jordan. Additionally, Christ is born from the \u03a0\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae, which translates to \"source\" or \"spring,\" emphasizing the maternal nature of water as a symbol of origin.",
