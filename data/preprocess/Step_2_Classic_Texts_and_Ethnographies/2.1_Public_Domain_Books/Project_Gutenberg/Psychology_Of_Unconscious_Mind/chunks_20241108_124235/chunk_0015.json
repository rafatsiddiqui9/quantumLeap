  "original_text": "That quotation, which, apparently, skips lightly over the situation,\n“Only this, and nothing more,” comes from a text which depicts in an\naffecting manner the despair over the lost Lenore. That quotation also\nmisleads our poet in the most striking manner. Therefore, she\nundervalues the erotic impression and the wide-reaching effect of the\ncommotion caused by it. It is this undervaluation, which Freud has\nformulated more precisely as “repression,” which is the reason why the\nerotic problem does not attain directly conscious treatment, and from\nthis there arise “these psychologic riddles.” The erotic impression\nworks in the unconscious, and, in its stead, pushes symbols forth into\nconsciousness. Thus, one plays hide-and-seek with one’s self. First, it\nis “the morning stars which sing together”; then “Paradise Lost”; then\nthe erotic yearning clothes itself in an ecclesiastical dress and utters\ndark words about “World Creation” and finally rises into a religious\nhymn to find there, at last, a way out into freedom, a way against which\nthe censor of the moral personality can oppose nothing more. The hymn\ncontains in its own peculiar character the marks of its origin. It thus\nhas fulfilled itself—the “Law of the Return of the Complex.” The night\nsinger, in this circuitous manner of the old transference to the\nFather-Priest, has become the “Eternal,” the “Creator,” the _God of\nTone, of Light, of Love_.\n\nThe indirect course of the libido seems to be a way of sorrow; at least\n“Paradise Lost” and the parallel reference to Job lead one to that\nconclusion. If we take, in addition to this, the introductory intimation\nof the identification with Christian, which we see concludes with\nCyrano, then we are furnished with material which pictures the indirect\ncourse of the libido as truly a way of sorrow. It is the same as when\nmankind, after the sinful fall, had the burden of the earthly life to\nbear, or like the tortures of Job, who suffered under the power of Satan\nand of God, and who himself, without suspecting it, became a plaything\nof the superhuman forces which we no longer consider as metaphysical,\nbut as metapsychological. Faust also offers us the same exhibition of\nGod’s wager.\n\n  _Mephistopheles_:\n\n          What will you bet? There’s still a chance to gain him\n          If unto me full leave you give\n          Gently upon my road to train him!\n\n  _Satan_:\n\n  But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will\n  curse thee to thy face.—_Job_ i: 11.\n\nWhile in Job the two great tendencies are characterized simply as good\nand bad, the problem in Faust is a pronouncedly erotic one; viz., the\nbattle between sublimation and eros, in which the Devil is strikingly\ncharacterized through the fitting rôle of the erotic tempter. The erotic\nis lacking in Job; at the same time Job is not conscious of the conflict\nwithin his own soul; he even continuously disputes the arguments of his\nfriends who wish to convince him of evil in his own heart. To this\nextent, one might say that Faust is considerably more honorable since he\nopenly confesses to the torments of his soul.\n\nMiss Miller acts like Job; she says nothing, and lets the evil and the\ngood come from the other world, from the metapsychologic. Therefore, the\nidentification with Job is also significant in this respect. A wider,\nand, indeed, a very important analogy remains to be mentioned. The\ncreative power, which love really is, rightly considered from the\nnatural standpoint, remains as the real attribute of the Divinity,\nsublimated from the erotic impression; therefore, in the poem God is\npraised throughout as Creator.\n\nJob offers the same illustration. Satan is the destroyer of Job’s\nfruitfulness. God is the fruitful one himself, therefore, at the end of\nthe book, he gives forth, as an expression of his own creative power,\nthis hymn, filled with lofty poetic beauty. In this hymn, strangely\nenough, two unsympathetic representatives of the animal kingdom,\nbehemoth and the leviathan, both expressive of the crudest force\nconceivable in nature, are given chief consideration; the behemoth being\nreally the phallic attribute of the God of Creation.\n\n      “Behold now behemoth, which I made as well as thee;\n      He eateth grass as an ox.\n      Lo, now; his strength is in his loins,\n      And his force is in the muscles of his belly.\n      He moveth his tail like a cedar:\n      The sinews of his thighs are knit together.\n      His bones are as tubes of brass;\n      His limbs are like bars of iron.\n      He is the chief of the ways of God:\n      He only that made him giveth him his sword....\n      Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;\n      He is confident though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.\n      Shall any take him when he is on the watch.\n      Or pierce through his nose with a snare?\n      Canst thou draw leviathan with a fish-hook?\n      Or press down his tongue with a cord?...\n      Lay thy hand upon him;\n      Remember the battle and do no more.\n      None is so fierce that dare stir him up:\n      Who then is he that can stand before me?\n      Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?\n      Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.”\n                        —_Job_ xl: 15–20, 23–24; xli: 1, 8, 10–11.\n\nGod says this in order to bring his power and omnipotence impressively\nbefore Job’s eyes. God is like the behemoth and the leviathan; the\nfruitful nature giving forth abundance,—the untamable wildness and\nboundlessness of nature,—and the overwhelming danger of the unchained\npower.[80]\n\nBut what has destroyed Job’s earthly paradise? The unchained power of\nnature. As the poet lets it be seen here, God has simply turned his\nother side outwards for once; the side which man calls the devil, and\nwhich lets loose all the torments of nature on Job, naturally for the\npurpose of discipline and training. The God who created such\nmonstrosities, before whom the poor weak man stiffens with anxiety,\ntruly must hide qualities within himself which are food for thought.\nThis God lives in the heart, in the unconscious, in the realm of\nmetapsychology. There is the source of the anxiety before the\nunspeakably horrible, and of the strength to withstand the horrors. The\nperson, that is to say his conscious “I,” is like a plaything, like a\nfeather which is whirled around by different currents of air; sometimes\nthe sacrifice and sometimes the sacrificer, and he cannot hinder either.\nThe Book of Job shows us God at work both as creator and destroyer. Who\nis this God? A thought which humanity in every part of the world and in\nall ages has brought forth from itself and always again anew in similar\nforms; a power in the other world to which man gives praise, a power\nwhich creates as well as destroys, an idea necessary to life. Since,\npsychologically understood, the divinity is nothing else than a\nprojected complex of representation which is accentuated in feeling\naccording to the degree of religiousness of the individual, so God is to\nbe considered as the representative of a certain sum of energy (libido).\nThis energy, therefore, appears projected (metaphysically) because it\nworks from the unconscious outwards, when it is dislodged from there, as\npsychoanalysis shows. As I have earlier made apparent in the “Bedeutung\ndes Vaters,” the religious instinct feeds upon the incestuous libido of\nthe infantile period. In the principal forms of religion which now\nexist, the father transference seems to be at least the moulding\ninfluence; in older religions, it seems to be the influence of the\nmother transference which creates the attributes of the divinity. The\nattributes of the divinity are omnipotence, a sternly persecuting\npaternalism ruling through fear (Old Testament) and a loving paternalism\n(New Testament). These are the attributes of the libido in that wide\nsense in which Freud has conceived this idea empirically. In certain\npagan and also in certain Christian attributes of divinity the maternal\nstands out strongly, and in the former the animal also comes into the\ngreatest prominence.[81] Likewise, the infantile, so closely interwoven\nwith religious phantasies, and from time to time breaking forth so\nviolently, is nowhere lacking.[82] All this points to the sources of the\ndynamic states of religious activity. These are those impulses which in\nchildhood are withdrawn from incestuous application through the\nintervention of the incest barrier and which, especially at the time of\npuberty, as a result of affluxes of libido coming from the still\nincompletely employed sexuality, are aroused to their own peculiar\nactivity. As is easily understood, that which is valuable in the\nGod-creating idea is not the form but the power, the libido. The\nprimitive power which Job’s Hymn of Creation vindicates, the\nunconditional and inexorable, the unjust and the superhuman, are truly\nand rightly attributes of libido, which “lead us unto life,” which “let\nthe poor be guilty,” and against which struggle is in vain. Nothing\nremains for mankind but to work in harmony with this will. Nietzsche’s\n“Zarathustra” teaches us this impressively.\n\nWe see that in Miss Miller the religious hymn arising from the\nunconscious is the compensating amend for the erotic; it takes a great\npart of its materials from the infantile reminiscences which she\nreawakened into life by the introversion of the libido. Had this\nreligious creation not succeeded (and also had another sublimated\napplication been eliminated) then Miss Miller would have yielded to the\nerotic impression, either to its natural consequence or to a negative\nissue, which would have replaced the lost success in love by a\ncorrespondingly strong sorrow. It is well known that opinions are much\ndivided concerning the worth of this issue of an erotic conflict, such\nas Miss Miller has presented to us. It is thought to be much more\nbeautiful to solve unnoticed an erotic tension, in the elevated feelings\nof religious poetry, in which perhaps many other people can find joy and\nconsolation. One is wrong to storm against this conception from the\nradical standpoint of fanaticism for truth.\n\nI think that one should view with philosophic admiration the strange\npaths of the libido and should investigate the purposes of its\ncircuitous ways.\n\nIt is not too much to say that we have herewith dug up the erotic root,\nand yet the problem remains unsolved. Were there not bound up with that\na mysterious purpose, probably of the greatest biological meaning, then\ncertainly twenty centuries would not have yearned for it with such\nintense longing. Doubtless, this sort of libidian current moves in the\nsame direction as, taken in the widest sense, did that ecstatic ideal of\nthe Middle Ages and of the ancient mystery cults, one of which became\nthe later Christianity. There is to be seen biologically in this ideal\nan exercise of psychologic projection (of the paranoidian mechanism, as\nFreud would express it).[83] The projection consists in the repressing\nof the conflict into the unconscious and the setting forth of the\nrepressed contents into seeming objectivity, which is also the formula\nof paranoia. The repression serves, as is well known, for the freeing\nfrom a painful complex from which one must escape by all means because\nits compelling and oppressing power is feared. The repression can lead\nto an apparent complete suppression which corresponds to a strong\nself-control. Unfortunately, however, self-control has limits which are\nonly too narrowly drawn. Closer observation of people shows, it is true,\nthat calm is maintained at the critical moment, but certain results\noccur which fall into two categories.\n\n_First_, the suppressed effect comes to the surface immediately\nafterwards; seldom directly, it is true, but ordinarily in the form of a\ndisplacement to another object (e. g. a person is, in official\nrelations, polite, submissive, patient, and so on, and turns his whole\nanger loose upon his wife or his subordinates).\n\n_Second_, the suppressed effect creates compensations elsewhere. For\nexample, people who strive for excessive ethics, who try always to\nthink, feel, and act altruistically and ideally, avenge themselves,\nbecause of the impossibility of carrying out their ideals, by subtle\nmaliciousness, which naturally does not come into their own\nconsciousness as such, but which leads to misunderstandings and unhappy\nsituations. Apparently, then, all of these are only “especially\nunfortunate circumstances,” or they are the guilt and malice of other\npeople, or they are tragic complications.\n\nOne is, indeed, freed of the conscious conflict, nevertheless it lies\ninvisible at one’s feet, and is stumbled over at every step. The technic\nof the apparent suppressing and forgetting is inadequate because it is\nnot possible of achievement in the last analysis—it is in reality a mere\nmakeshift. The religious projection offers a much more effectual help.\nIn this one keeps the conflict in sight (care, pain, anxiety, and so on)\nand gives it over to a personality standing outside of one’s self, the\nDivinity. The evangelical command teaches us this:\n\n  “Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.”—_I Peter_\n  v: 7.",
