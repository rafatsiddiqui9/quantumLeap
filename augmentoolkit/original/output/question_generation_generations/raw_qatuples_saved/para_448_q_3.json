    "paragraph": "(6) \u201cThere was a man sent from God whose name was John.(7) \u201cThe same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light.(8) \u201cHe was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that  Light.(9) \u201cThat was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh  into the world.\u201dThis is the proclamation of the reappearing light, the reborn sun, which formerly was, and which will be again. In the baptistry at Pisa, Christ is represented bringing the tree of life to man; his head is surrounded by a sun halo. Over this relief stand the words INTROITUS SOLIS.Because the one born was his own procreator, the history of his procreation is strangely concealed under symbolic events, which are meant to conceal and deny it; hence the extraordinary assertion of the virgin conception. This is meant to hide the incestuous impregnation. But do not let us forget that this na\u00efve assertion plays an unusually important part in the ingenious symbolic bridge, which is to guide the libido out from the incestuous bond to higher and more useful applications, which indicate a new kind of immortality; that is to say, immortal work.The environment of Hiawatha\u2019s youth is of importance:\u201cBy the shores of Gitche Gumee,         By the shining Big-Sea-Water,         Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,         Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.         Dark behind it rose the forest,         Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,         Rose the firs with cones upon them.         Bright before it beat the water,         Beat the clear and sunny water,         Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the environment described in the text about Hiawatha's youth signify?",
    "answer": "The environment described around Hiawatha's youth is set by the shores of Gitche Gumee, a large lake, surrounded by a dense forest with dark and gloomy pine trees and fir trees with cones. The brightness of the water before the wigwam symbolizes a contrast between the natural setting and the spiritual or symbolic significance of the dwelling and its occupant.",
