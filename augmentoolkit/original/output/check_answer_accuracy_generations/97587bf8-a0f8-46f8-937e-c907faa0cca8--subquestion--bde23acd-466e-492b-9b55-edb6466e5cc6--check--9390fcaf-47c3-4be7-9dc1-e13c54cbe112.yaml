- content: 'Text: """A fleeting glance at the history of evolution is sufficient to
    teach us that countless complicated functions to which to-day must be denied any
    sexual character were originally pure derivations from the general impulse of
    propagation. During the ascent through the animal kingdom an important displacement
    in the fundamentals of the procreative instinct has taken place. The mass of the
    reproductive products with the uncertainty of fertilization has more and more
    been replaced by a controlled impregnation and an effective protection of the
    offspring. In this way part of the energy required in the production of eggs and
    sperma has been transposed into the creation of mechanisms for allurement and
    for protection of the young. Thus we discover the first instincts of art in animals
    used in the service of the impulse of creation, and limited to the breeding season.
    The original sexual character of these biological institutions became lost in
    their organic fixation and functional independence. Even if there can be no doubt
    about the sexual origin of music, still it would be a poor, unæsthetic generalization
    if one were to include music in the category of sexuality. A similar nomenclature
    would then lead us to classify the cathedral of Cologne as mineralogy because
    it is built of stones. It can be a surprise only to those to whom the history
    of evolution is unknown to find how few things there really are in human life
    which cannot be reduced in the last analysis to the instinct of procreation. It
    includes very nearly everything, I think, which is beloved and dear to us. We
    spoke just now of libido as the creative impulse and at the same time we allied
    ourselves with the conception which opposes libido to hunger in the same way that
    the instinct of the preservation of the species is opposed to the instinct of
    self-preservation. In nature, this artificial distinction does not exist."""
