    "paragraph": "Wisdom dwells in the depths, the wisdom of the mother: being one with it, insight is obtained into the meaning of deeper things, into all the deposits of primitive times, the strata of which have been preserved in the soul. H\u00f6lderlin, in his diseased ecstasy, feels once more the greatness of the things seen, but he does not care to bring up to the light of day that which he had found in the depths\u2014in this he differs from Faust.\u201cAnd it is not an evil, if a few        Are lost and never found, and if the speech        Conceals the living sound;        Because each godly work resembles ours;        And yet the Highest does not plan it all\u2014        The great pit bears two irons,        And the glowing lava of Aetna....        Would I had the power        To build an image and see the Spirit\u2014        See it as it was!\u201dHe allows only one hope to glimmer through, formed in scanty words:\u201cHe wakes the dead;        They who are not enchained and bound,        They who are not unwrought.        ... And if the Heavenly Ones        Now, as I believe, love me\u2014        ... Silent is his sign[802]        In the dusky sky. And one stands under it        His whole life long\u2014for Christ still lives.\u201dBut, as once Gilgamesh, bringing back the magic herb from the west land, was robbed of his treasure by the demon serpent, so does H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poem die away in a painful lament, which betrays to us that no victorious resurrection will follow his descent to the shadows:\u201c... Ignominiously        A power tears our heart away,        For sacrifices the heavenly ones demand.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the poem end, and what does the final section convey?",
