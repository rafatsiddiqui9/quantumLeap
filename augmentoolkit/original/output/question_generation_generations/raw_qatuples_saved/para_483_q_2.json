    "paragraph": "It frequently happens that the young person is so closely bound in the family relations that it is only with the greatest difficulty that he can attain any measure of freedom and then only very imperfectly, so that the libido sexualis can only express itself in certain feelings and phantasies which clearly reveal the existence of the complex until then entirely hidden and unrealized. Now commences the secondary struggle against the unfilial and immoral feelings with a consequent development of intense resistances expressing themselves in irritation, anger, revolt and antagonism against the parents, or else in an especially tender, submissive and yielding attitude which over-compensates for the rebellion and reaction held within.This struggle and conflict gives rise to the unconscious phantasy of self-sacrifice which really means the sacrificing of the childish tendencies and love type in order to free libido; for his nature demands that he attain the capacity for the accomplishment of his own personal fulfilment, the satisfaction of which belongs to the developed man and woman.This conception has been worked out in detail by Jung in the book which is herein presented to English readers.We now come to the most important of Jung\u2019s conceptions in that it bears practically upon the treatment of certain types of the neuroses and stands theoretically in direct opposition to Freud\u2019s hypothesis. While recognizing fully the influence of the parents and of the sexual constitution of the child, Jung refuses to see in this infantile past the real cause for the later development of the illness. He definitely places the cause of the pathogenic conflict _in the present moment_ and considers that in seeking for the cause in the distant past one is only following the desire of the patient, which is to withdraw himself as much as possible from the present important period.",

    "question": "What unconscious phantasy might arise during this conflict, and what does it symbolize?\n\n**ANSWERS:**\nDuring this conflict, the unconscious phantasy of self-sacrifice might arise. This phantasy symbolizes the sacrificing of childish tendencies and love types in order to free libido. It represents the young person's need to attain the capacity for personal fulfillment, which belongs to developed adults.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat work by Jung is being referenced here, and what is its significance?",
    "answer": "The work being referenced is a book written by Jung that has now been translated into English. This book is significant because it contains detailed conceptions that Jung has developed, particularly in relation to the treatment of certain types of neuroses and in opposition to Freud's hypotheses. It emphasizes that the cause of the pathogenic conflict lies in the present moment, rather than in the distant past as the patient might desire.",
