This especial tree\nseems simply to continue the category of the mother symbols. The\nattribute “strange” probably signifies, as in dreams, a special\nemphasis, that is, a special underlying complex material. Unfortunately,\nthe author gives us no individual material for this. As the tree already\nsuggested in the symbolism of the city is particularly emphasized\nthrough the further development of Miss Miller’s visions here, I find it\nnecessary to discuss at some length the history of the symbolism of the\ntree.\n\nIt is well known that trees have played a large part in the cult myth\nfrom the remotest times. The typical myth tree is the tree of paradise\nor of life which we discover abundantly used in Babylonian and also in\nJewish lore; and in prechristian times, the pine tree of Attis, the tree\nor trees of Mithra; in Germanic mythology, Ygdrasil and so on. The\nhanging of the Attis image on the pine tree; the hanging of Marsyas,\nwhich became a celebrated artistic motive; the hanging of Odin; the\nGermanic hanging sacrifices—indeed, the whole series of hanged\ngods—teaches us that the hanging of Christ on the cross is not a unique\noccurrence in religious mythology, but belongs to the same circle of\nideas as others. In this world of imagery the cross of Christ is the\ntree of life, and equally the wood of death. This contrast is not\nastounding. Just as the origin of man from trees was a legendary idea,\nso there were also burial customs, in which people were buried in hollow\ntrees. From that the German language retains even now the expression\n“Totenbaum” (tree of death) for a coffin. Keeping in mind the fact that\nthe tree is predominantly a mother symbol, then the mystic significance\nof this manner of burial can be in no way incomprehensible to us. _The\ndead are delivered back to the mother for rebirth._ We encounter this\nsymbol in the Osiris myth, handed down by Plutarch,[467] which is, in\ngeneral, typical in various aspects. Rhea is pregnant with Osiris; at\nthe same time also with Isis; Osiris and Isis mate even in the mother’s\nwomb (motive of the night journey on the sea with incest). Their son is\nArueris, later called Horus. It is said of Isis that she was born “in\nabsolute humidity” (τετάρτῃ δὲ τῆν Ἴσιν ἐν πανύγροις γενέσθαι[468]). It\nis said of Osiris that a certain Pamyles in Thebes heard a voice from\nthe temple of Zeus while drawing water, which commanded him to proclaim\nthat Osiris was born μέγας βασιλεὺς εὐεργέτης Ὄσιρις.[469] In honor of\nthis the Pamylion were celebrated. They were similar to the\nphallophorion. Pamyles is a phallic demon, similar to the original\nDionysus. The myth reduced reads: Osiris and Isis were generated by\nphallus from the water (mother womb) in the ordinary manner. (Kronos had\nmade Rhea pregnant, the relation was secret, and Rhea was his sister.\nHelios, however, observed it and cursed the relation.) Osiris was killed\nin a crafty manner by the god of the underworld, Typhon, who locked him\nin a chest. He was thrown into the Nile, and so carried out to sea.\nOsiris, however, mated in the underworld with his second sister,\nNephthys (motive of the night journey to the sea with incest). One sees\nhere how the symbolism is developed. In the mother womb, before the\noutward existence, Osiris commits incest; in death, the second\nintrauterine existence, Osiris again commits incest. Both times with a\nsister who is simply substituted for the mother as a legal, uncensured\nsymbol, since the marriage with a sister in early antiquity was not\nmerely tolerated, but was really commended. Zarathustra also recommended\nthe marriage of kindred. This form of myth would be impossible to-day,\nbecause cohabitation with the sister, being incestuous, would be\nrepressed. The wicked Typhon entices Osiris craftily into a box or\nchest; this distortion of the true state of affairs is transparent. The\n“original sin” caused men to wish to go back into the mother again, that\nis, the incestuous desire for the mother, condemned by law, is the ruse\nsupposedly invented by Typhon. The fact is, the ruse is very\nsignificant. Man tries to sneak into rebirth through subterfuge in order\nto become a child again. An early Egyptian hymn[470] even raises an\naccusation against the mother Isis because she destroys the sun-god Rê\nby treachery. It was interpreted as the ill-will of the mother towards\nher son that she banished and betrayed him. The hymn describes how Isis\nfashioned a snake, put it in the path of Rê, and how the snake wounded\nthe sun-god with a poisonous bite, from which wound he never recovered,\nso that finally he had to retire on the back of the heavenly cow. But\nthis cow is the cow-headed goddess, just as Osiris is the bull Apis. The\nmother is accused as if she were the cause of man flying to the mother\nin order to be cured of the wound which she had herself inflicted. This\nwound is the prohibition of incest.[471] Man is thus cut off from the\nhopeful certainty of childhood and early youth, from all the\nunconscious, instinctive happenings which permit the child to live as an\nappendage of his parents, unconscious of himself. There must be\ncontained in this many sensitive memories of the animal age, where there\nwas not any “thou shalt” and “thou shalt not,” but all was just simple\noccurrence. Even yet a deep animosity seems to live in man because a\nbrutal law has separated him from the instinctive yielding to his\ndesires and from the great beauty of the harmony of the animal nature.\nThis separation manifested itself, among other things, in the incest\nprohibition and its correlates (laws of marriage, etc.); therefore pain\nand anger relate to the mother, as if she were responsible for the\ndomestication of the sons of men. In order not to become conscious of\nhis incest wish (his backward harking to the animal nature), the son\nthrows all the burden of the guilt on the mother, from which arises the\nidea of the “terrible mother.”[472] The mother becomes for him a spectre\nof anxiety, a nightmare.[473]\n\nAfter the completed “night journey to the sea,” the chest of Osiris was\ncast ashore by Byblos, and lay in the branches of an Erica, which grew\naround the coffin and became a splendid tree. The king of the land had\nthe tree placed as a column under his roof.[474] During this period of\nOsiris’s absence (the winter solstice) the lament customary during\nthousands of years for the dead god and his return occurs, and its\nεὕρεσις is a feast of joy. A passage from the mournful quest of Isis is\nespecially noteworthy:\n\n  “She flutters like a swallow lamenting around the column, which\n  encloses the god sleeping in death.”\n\n(This same motive returns in the Kyffhäuser saga.)\n\n[Illustration: FRUCTIFICATION FOLLOWING UPON THE MITHRAIC SACRIFICE]\n\nLater on Typhon dismembers the corpse and scatters the pieces. We come\nupon the _motive of dismemberment_ in countless sun myths,[475] namely,\nthe inversion of the idea of the composition of the child in the\nmother’s womb.[476] In fact, the mother Isis collects the pieces of the\nbody with the help of the jackal-headed Anubis. (She finds the corpse\nwith the help of dogs.) Here the nocturnal devourers of bodies, the dogs\nand jackals, become the assistants of the composition, of the\nreproduction.[477] The Egyptian vulture owes its symbolic meaning as\nmother to this necrophagic habit. In Persian antiquity the corpses were\nthrown out for the dogs to devour, just as to-day in the Indian funeral\npyres the removal of the carcasses is left to the vultures. Persia was\nfamiliar with the custom of leading a dog to the bed of one dying,\nwhereupon the latter had to present the dog with a morsel.[478] The\ncustom, on its surface, evidently signifies that the morsel is to belong\nto the dog, so that he will spare the body of the dead, precisely as\nCerberus was soothed by the honey-cakes which Hercules gave to him in\nthe journey to hell. But when we bear in mind the jackal-headed Anubis\nwho rendered his good services in the gathering together of the\ndismembered Osiris, and the mother significance of the vulture, then the\nquestion arises whether something deeper was not meant by this ceremony.\nCreuzer has also concerned himself with this idea, and has come to the\nconclusion that the astral form of the dog ceremony, that is, the\nappearance of Sirius, the dog star, at the period of the sun’s highest\nposition, is related to this in that the introduction of the dog has a\ncompensatory significance, death being thereby made, reversedly, equal\nto the sun’s highest position. This is quite in conformity with\npsychologic thought, which results from the very general fact that death\nis interpreted as entrance into the mother’s womb (rebirth). This\ninterpretation would seem to be supported by the otherwise enigmatic\nfunction of the dog in the Sacrificium Mithriacum. In the monuments a\ndog always leaps up upon the bull killed by Mithra. However, this\nsacrifice is probably to be interpreted through the Persian legend, as\nwell as through the monument, as the moment of the _highest fecundity_.\nThe most beautiful expression of this is seen upon the magnificent\nMithra relief of Heddernheim. Upon one side of a large stone slab\n(formerly probably rotating) is seen the stereotyped overthrowing and\nsacrifice of the bull, but upon the other side stands Sol, with a bunch\nof grapes in his hand, Mithra with the cornucopia, the Dadophores with\nfruits, corresponding to the legend that all fecundity proceeds from the\ndead bull of the world, fruits from the horns, wine from its blood,\ngrain from the tail, cattle from its sperma, leek from its nose, and so\non. Silvanus stands above this scene with the animals of the forest\narising from him. The significance suspected by Creuzer might very\neasily belong to the dog in this connection.[479] Let us now turn back\nto the myth of Osiris. In spite of the restoration of the corpse\naccomplished by Isis, the resuscitation succeeds only incompletely in so\nfar as the phallus of Osiris cannot again be produced, because it was\neaten by the fishes; the power of life was wanting.[480] Osiris as a\nphantom once more impregnated Isis, but the fruit is Harpocrates, who\nwas feeble in τοῖς κάτωθεν γυίοις (in the lower limbs), that is,\ncorresponding to the significance of γυῖον (at the feet). (Here, as is\nplainly evident, foot is used in the phallic meaning.) This incurability\nof the setting sun corresponds to the incurability of Rê in the\nabove-mentioned older Egyptian sun hymn. Osiris, although only a\nphantom, now prepares the young sun, his son Horus, for a battle with\nTyphon, the evil spirit of darkness. Osiris and Horus correspond to the\nfather-son symbolism mentioned in the beginning, which symbolic figure,\ncorresponding again to the above formulation,[481] is flanked by the\nwell-formed and ugly figures of Horus and Harpocrates, the latter\nappearing mostly as a cripple, often represented distorted to a mere\ncaricature.[482]",
