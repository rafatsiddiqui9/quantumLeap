    "paragraph": "When I said just now that directed thinking is properly a thinking with words, and quoted that clever testimony of Anatole France as drastic proof of it, a misunderstanding might easily arise, namely, that directed thinking is really only \u201cword.\u201d That certainly would go too far. Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider sense than that of speech, which is in itself only the expression of the formulated thought which is capable of being communicated in the widest sense. Otherwise, the deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity for thinking, which is not the case in reality. Without any knowledge of the spoken word, he has his \u201clanguage.\u201d This language, considered from the standpoint of history, or in other words, directed thinking, is here a descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance, Wundt[22] expresses it.\u201cA further important result of that co-operation of sound and sign  interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually lose  altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and turn into  signs for general ideas and for the expression of the apperceptive  functions of relation and comparison and their products. In this  manner abstract thought develops, which, because it would not be  possible without the change of meaning lying at the root of it, is  indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical reciprocal  action out of which the development of language takes place.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the author broaden the definition of language beyond just speech?",
    "answer": "The author broadens the definition of language to include any form of communication capable of conveying thought. This means that language is not limited to spoken words but can encompass other means of expression, such as sign language or written symbols, which allow for the formulation and communication of thoughts.",
