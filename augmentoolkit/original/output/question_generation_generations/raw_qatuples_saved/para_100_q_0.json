    "paragraph": "A six-year-old girl, who goes to school unwillingly, dreams that her leg is encircled by a large red worm. She had a tender interest for this creature, contrary to what might be expected. An adult patient, who cannot separate from an older friend on account of an extraordinarily strong mother transference, dreams that \u201cshe had to get across some deep water (typical idea!) with this friend; her friend fell in (mother transference); she tries to drag her out, and almost succeeds, but a large crab seizes on the dreamer by the foot and tries to pull her in.\u201d",

    "question": "In a dream, a six-year-old girl finds her leg encircled by a large red worm. She shows a tender interest in this creature. How might a psychologist interpret this dream?",
    "answer": "A psychologist might interpret the large red worm as a symbolic representation of the girl's developing body and the physical changes that come with growing up. The girl's tender interest in the worm could indicate a fascination with her own physical development, which is a common and natural curiosity in children of her age.",
