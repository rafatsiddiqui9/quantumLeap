    "paragraph": "With this alteration in the libido conception, certain parts of our terminology need revision as well. As we know, Abraham has undertaken the experiment of transferring the Freudian libido theory to dementia pr\u00e6cox and has conceived the characteristic lack of rapport and the cessation of the function of reality as autoerotism. This conception needs revision. Hysterical introversion of the libido leads to autoerotism, since the patient\u2019s erotic afflux of libido designed for the function of adaptation is introverted, whereby his ego is occupied by the corresponding amount of erotic libido. The schizophrenic, however, shuns reality far more than merely the erotic afflux would account for; therefore, his inner condition is very different from that of the hysteric. He is more than autoerotic, he builds up an intra-psychic equivalent for reality, for which purpose he has necessarily to employ other dynamics than that afforded by the erotic afflux. Therefore, I must grant to Bleuler the right to reject the conception of autoerotism, taken from the study of hysterical neuroses, and there legitimate, and to replace it by the conception of autismus.[268] I am forced to say that this term is better fitted to facts than autoerotism. With this I acknowledge my earlier idea of the identity of autismus (Bleuler) and autoerotism (Freud) as unjustified, and, therefore, retract it.[269] This thorough revision of the conception of libido has compelled me to this.",

    "question": "What is the significance of the change in terminology from \"autoerotism\" to \"autismus\" in the context of understanding schizophrenia?",
    "answer": "The change in terminology from \"autoerotism\" to \"autismus\" is significant because it better captures the unique characteristics of schizophrenia. While autoerotism relates more to the introversion of erotic libido in hysterical conditions, autismus reflects the broader and more complex way in which a schizophrenic patient distances themselves from reality and constructs an intra-psychic equivalent for it. This change helps in providing a more accurate description and understanding of the condition.",
