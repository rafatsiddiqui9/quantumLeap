The day, in truth, has originated for the horse as the sacrificial  dish, which stands before him; his cradle is in the world-sea towards  the East; the night has originated for him as the sacrificial dish,  which stands behind him; its cradle is in the world-sea of the  evening; these two dishes originated in order to surround the horse.  As a charger he generated the gods, as champion he produced the  Gandharvas, as a racer the demons, as horse mankind. The Ocean is his  relative, the ocean his cradle.\u201dAs Deussen remarks, the sacrificial horse has the significance of a _renunciation of the universe_. When the horse is sacrificed, then the world is sacrificed and destroyed, as it were\u2014a train of thought which Schopenhauer also had in mind, and which appears as a product of a diseased mind in Schreber.[816] The horse in the above text stands between two sacrificial vessels, from one of which it comes and to the other of which it goes, just as the sun passes from morning to evening. The horse, therefore, signifies the libido, which has passed into the world. We previously saw that the \u201cmother libido\u201d must be sacrificed in order to produce the world; here the world is destroyed by the repeated sacrifice of the same libido, which once belonged to the mother. The horse can, therefore, be substituted as a symbol for this libido, because, as we saw, it had manifold connections with the mother.[817] The sacrifice of the horse can only produce another state of introversion, which is similar to that before the creation of the world. The position of the horse between the two vessels, which represent the producing and the devouring mother, hint at the idea of life enclosed in the ovum; therefore, the vessels are destined to \u201csurround\u201d the horse. That this is actually so the Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad 3: 3 proves:",

    "question": "How is the horse related to the concept of libido and the mother in the text?",
    "answer": "The horse is closely associated with the concept of libido and the mother. It is noted that the horse must be sacrificed to produce the world, and similarly, the sacrifice of the horse can only produce another state of introversion. This association is further supported by the horse's manifold connections with the mother, indicating its symbolic role in representing the libido that has entered the world.",
