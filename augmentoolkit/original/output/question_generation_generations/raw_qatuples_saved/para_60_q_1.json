Et hunc quidam monachus, bene ob  meritum cognitus Stiliconi tunc patricio, eo modo subvertit; baculo,  manu, singulos gradus palpandos inspiciens, statim ut illum tangens  fraudem diabolicam repperit, eo transgresso descendens, draconem  scidit, misitque in partes: ostendens et hie deos non esse qui manu  fiunt.\u201d[717]",

    "question": "How was the dragon's threat to the virgins neutralized, and who was responsible for this action?",
    "answer": "The dragon's threat to the virgins was neutralized by a monk, who was renowned for his merits and was known to Stilicon, a patrician at the time. This monk discovered the dragon's artifice by carefully inspecting each step of the staircase with a stick, hand, and by feeling each step. Upon discovering the fraudulent artifice, the monk immediately descended and split the dragon into pieces, thus demonstrating that the gods are not those who are created by human hands.",
