What this signifies we already know—the libido sinks into\nits “own depths” (a well-known comparison of Nietzsche’s) and finds\nthere below, in the shadows of the unconscious, the substitute for the\nupper world, which it has abandoned: _the world of memories_ (“’mid a\nhundred memories”), the strongest and most influential of which are the\nearly infantile memory pictures. It is the world of the child, this\nparadise-like state of earliest childhood, from which we are separated\nby a hard law. In this subterranean kingdom slumber sweet feelings of\nhome and the endless hopes of all that is to be. As Heinrich in the\n“Sunken Bell,” by Gerhart Hauptmann, says, in speaking of his miraculous\nwork:\n\n             “There is a song lost and forgotten,\n             A song of home, a love song of childhood,\n             Brought up from the depths of the fairy well,\n             Known to all, but yet unheard.”\n\nHowever, as Mephistopheles says, “The danger is great.” These depths are\nenticing; they are the mother and—death. When the libido leaves the\nbright upper world, whether from the decision of the individual or from\ndecreasing life force, then it sinks back into its own depths, into the\nsource from which it has gushed forth, and turns back to that point of\ncleavage, the umbilicus, through which it once entered into this body.\nThis point of cleavage is called the mother, because from her comes the\nsource of the libido. Therefore, when some great work is to be\naccomplished, before which weak man recoils, doubtful of his strength,\nhis libido returns to that source—and this is the dangerous moment, in\nwhich the decision takes place between annihilation and new life. If the\nlibido remains arrested in the wonder kingdom of the inner world,[610]\nthen the man has become for the world above a phantom, then he is\npractically dead or desperately ill.[611] But if the libido succeeds in\ntearing itself loose and pushing up into the world above, then a miracle\nappears. This journey to the underworld has been a fountain of youth,\nand new fertility springs from his apparent death. This train of thought\nis very beautifully gathered into a Hindoo myth: Once upon a time,\nVishnu sank into an ecstasy (introversion) and during this state of\nsleep bore Brahma, who, enthroned upon the lotus flower, arose from the\nnavel of Vishnu, bringing with him the Vedas, which he diligently read.\n(Birth of creative thought from introversion.) But through Vishnu’s\necstasy a devouring flood came upon the world. (Devouring through\nintroversion, symbolizing the danger of entering into the mother of\ndeath.) A demon taking advantage of the danger, stole the Vedas from\nBrahma and hid them in the depths. (Devouring of the libido.) Brahma\nroused Vishnu, and the latter, transforming himself into a fish, plunged\ninto the flood, fought with the demon (battle with the dragon),\nconquered him and recaptured the Vedas. (Treasure obtained with\ndifficulty.)\n\nSelf-concentration and the strength derived therefrom correspond to this\nprimitive train of thought. It also explains numerous sacrificial and\nmagic rites which we have already fully discussed. Thus the impregnable\nTroy falls because the besiegers creep into the belly of a wooden horse;\nfor he alone is a hero who is reborn from the mother, like the sun. But\nthe danger of this venture is shown by the history of Philoctetes, who\nwas the only one in the Trojan expedition who knew the hidden sanctuary\nof Chryse, where the Argonauts had sacrificed already, and where the\nGreeks planned to sacrifice in order to assure a safe ending to their\nundertaking. Chryse was a nymph upon the island of Chryse; according to\nthe account of the scholiasts in Sophocles’s “Philoctetes,” this nymph\nloved Philoctetes, and cursed him because he spurned her love. This\ncharacteristic projection, which is also met with in the Gilgamesh epic,\nshould be referred back, as suggested, to the repressed incest wish of\nthe son, who is represented through the projection as if the mother had\nthe evil wish, for the refusal of which the son was given over to death.\nIn reality, however, the son becomes mortal by separating himself from\nthe mother. His fear of death, therefore, corresponds to the repressed\nwish to turn back to the mother, and causes him to believe that the\nmother threatens or pursues him. The teleological significance of this\n_fear of persecution_ is evident; _it is to keep son and mother apart_.\n\nThe curse of Chryse is realized in so far that Philoctetes, according to\none version, when approaching his altar, injured himself in his foot\nwith one of his own deadly poisonous arrows, or, according to another\nversion[612] (this is better and far more abundantly proven), _was\nbitten in his foot by a poisonous serpent_.[613] From then on he is\nailing.[614]\n\nThis very typical wound, which also destroyed Rê, is described in the\nfollowing manner in an Egyptian hymn:\n\n          “The ancient of the Gods moved his mouth,\n          He cast his saliva upon the earth,\n          And what he spat, fell upon the ground.\n          With her hands Isis kneaded that and the soil\n          Which was about it, together:\n          From that she created a venerable worm,\n          And made him like a spear.\n          She did not twist him living around her face,\n          But threw him coiled upon the path,\n          Upon which the great God wandered at ease\n          Through all his lands.\n\n          “The venerable God stepped forth radiantly,\n          The gods who served Pharaoh accompanied him,\n          And he proceeded as every day.\n          Then the venerable worm stung him....\n          The divine God opened his mouth\n          And the voice of his majesty echoed even to the sky.\n          And the gods exclaimed: Behold!\n          Thereupon he could not answer,\n          His jaws chattered,\n          All his limbs trembled\n          And the poison gripped his flesh,\n          As the Nile seizes upon the land.”\n\nIn this hymn Egypt has again preserved for us a primitive conception of\nthe serpent’s sting. The aging of the autumn sun as an image of human\nsenility is symbolically traced back to the mother through the poisoning\nby the serpent. The mother is reproached, because her malice causes the\ndeath of the sun-god. The serpent, the primitive symbol of fear,[615]\nillustrates the repressed tendency to turn back to the mother, because\nthe only possibility of security from death is possessed by the mother,\nas the source of life.\n\nAccordingly, only the mother can cure him, sick unto death, and,\ntherefore, the hymn goes on to depict how the gods were assembled to\ntake counsel:\n\n      “And Isis came with her wisdom:\n      Her mouth is full of the breath of life,\n      Her words banish sorrow,\n      And her speech animates those who no longer breathe.\n      She said: ‘What is that; what is that, divine father?\n      Behold, a worm has brought you sorrow——’\n\n      “‘Tell me thy name, divine father,\n      Because the man remains alive, who is called by his name.’”\n\nWhereupon Rê replied:\n\n    “‘I am he, who created heaven and earth, and piled up the hills,\n    And created all beings thereon.\n    I am he, who made the water and caused the great flood,\n    Who produced the bull of his mother,\n    Who is the procreator,’ etc.\n\n    “The poison did not depart, it went further,\n    The great God was not cured.\n    Then said Isis to Rê:\n    ‘Thine is not the name thou hast told me.\n    Tell me true that the poison may leave thee,\n    For he whose name is spoken will live.’”\n\nFinally Rê decides to speak his true name. He is approximately healed\n(imperfect composition of Osiris); but he has lost his power, and\nfinally he retreats to the heavenly cow.\n\nThe poisonous worm is, if one may speak in this way, a “negative”\nphallus, a deadly, not an animating, form of libido; therefore, a wish\nfor death, instead of a wish for life. The “true name” is soul and magic\npower; hence a symbol of libido. What Isis demands is the retransference\nof the libido to the mother goddess. This request is fulfilled\nliterally, for the aged god turns back to the divine cow, the symbol of\nthe mother.[616] This symbolism is clear from our previous explanations.\nThe onward urging, living libido which rules the consciousness of the\nson, demands separation from the mother. The longing of the child for\nthe mother is a hindrance on the path to this, taking the form of a\npsychologic resistance, which is expressed empirically in the neurosis\nby all manners of fears, that is to say, the fear of life. The more a\nperson withdraws from adaptation to reality, and falls into slothful\ninactivity, the greater becomes his anxiety (cum grano salis), which\neverywhere besets him at each point as a hindrance upon his path. The\nfear springs from the mother, that is to say, from the longing to go\nback to the mother, which is opposed to the adaptation to reality. This\nis the way in which the mother has become apparently the malicious\npursuer. Naturally, it is not the actual mother, although the actual\nmother, with the abnormal tenderness with which she sometimes pursues\nher child, even into adult years, may gravely injure it through a\nwillful prolonging of the infantile state in the child. It is rather the\nmother-imago, which becomes the Lamia. The mother-imago, however,\npossesses its power solely and exclusively from the son’s tendency not\nonly to look and to work forwards, but also to glance backwards to the\npampering sweetness of childhood, to that glorious state of\nirresponsibility and security with which the protecting mother-care once\nsurrounded him.[617]\n\nThe retrospective longing acts like a paralyzing poison upon the energy\nand enterprise; so that it may well be compared to a poisonous serpent\nwhich lies across our path. Apparently, it is a hostile demon which robs\nus of energy, but, in reality, it is the individual unconscious, the\nretrogressive tendency of which begins to overcome the conscious forward\nstriving. The cause of this can be, for example, the natural aging which\nweakens the energy, or it may be great external difficulties, which\ncause man to break down and become a child again, or it may be, and this\nis probably the most frequent cause, the woman who enslaves the man, so\nthat he can no longer free himself, and becomes a child again.[618] It\nmay be of significance also that Isis, as sister-wife of the sun-god,\ncreates the poisonous animal from the spittle of the god, which is\nperhaps a substitute for sperma, and, therefore, is a symbol of libido.\nShe creates the animal from the libido of the god; that means she\nreceives his power, making him weak and dependent, so that by this means\nshe assumes the dominating rôle of the mother. (Mother transference to\nthe wife.) This part is preserved in the legend of Samson, in the rôle\nof Delilah, who cut off Samson’s hair, the sun’s rays, thus robbing him\nof his strength.[619] Any weakening of the adult man strengthens the\nwishes of the unconscious; therefore, the decrease of strength appears\ndirectly as the backward striving towards the mother.\n\nThere is still to be considered one more source of the reanimation of\nthe mother-imago. We have already met it in the discussion of the mother\nscene in “Faust,” that is to say, _the willed introversion of a creative\nmind_, which, retreating before its own problem and inwardly collecting\nits forces, dips at least for a moment into the source of life, in order\nthere to wrest a little more strength from the mother for the completion\nof its work. It is a mother-child play with one’s self, in which lies\nmuch weak selfadmiration and self-adulation (“Among a hundred\nmirrors”—Nietzsche); _a Narcissus state_, a strange spectacle, perhaps,\nfor profane eyes. The separation from the mother-imago, the birth out of\none’s self, reconciles all conflicts through the sufferings. This is\nprobably meant by Nietzsche’s verse:\n\n                 “Why hast thou enticed thyself\n                 Into the Paradise of the old serpent?\n                 Why hast thou crept\n                 Into thyself, thyself?...\n\n                 “A sick man now\n                 Sick of a serpent’s poison,[620]\n                 A captive now\n                 Whom the hardest destiny befell\n                 In thine own pit;\n                 Bowed down as thou workest\n                 Encaved within thyself,\n                 Burrowing into thyself,\n                 Helpless,\n                 Stiff,\n                 A corpse.\n                 Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,\n                 Overburdened by thyself.\n                 A wise man,\n                 A self-knower,\n                 The wise Zarathustra;\n                 Thou soughtest the heaviest burden\n                 And foundest thou thyself....”",
