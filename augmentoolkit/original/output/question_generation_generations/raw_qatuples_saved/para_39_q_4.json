    "paragraph": "Love raises man, not only above himself, but also above the bounds of his mortality and earthliness, up to divinity itself, and in the very act of raising him it destroys him. Mythologically, this self-presumption finds its striking expression in the building of the heaven-high tower of Babel, which brings confusion to mankind.[192] In Byron\u2019s poem it is the sinful ambition of the race of Cain, for love of which it makes even the stars subservient and leads away the sons of God themselves. If, indeed, longing for the highest things\u2014if I may speak so\u2014is legitimate, then it lies in the circumstances that it leaves its human boundaries, that of sinfulness, and, therefore, destruction. The longing of the moth for the star is not absolutely pure and transparent, but glows in sultry mist, for man continues to be man. Through the excess of his longing he draws down the divine into the corruption of his passion;[193] therefore, he seems to raise himself to the Divine; but with that his humanity is destroyed. Thus the love of Anah and Aholibama for their angels becomes the ruin of gods and men. The invocation with which Cain\u2019s daughters implore their angels is psychologically an exact parallel to Miss Miller\u2019s poem._Anah_:[194]Seraph!   From thy sphere!   Whatever star[195] contains thy glory.In the eternal depths of heaven   Albeit thou watchest with the \u2018seven,\u2019   Though through space infinite and hoary   Before thy bright wings worlds will be driven,Yet hear!   Oh! think of her who holds thee dear!And though she nothing is to thee,   Yet think that thou art all to her.\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7",

    "question": "What does the text suggest is the nature of Anah and Aholibama's love for their angels, and what are the consequences of this love?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that Anah and Aholibama's love for their angels is a form of sinful ambition, as it leads to the ruin of both gods and men. Their love for the divine beings results in the destruction of their human nature, illustrating how the pursuit of the divine through love can result in the annihilation of both the lovers and their divine counterparts.",
