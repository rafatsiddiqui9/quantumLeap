They do that very generally, thus in the Greek\nlegend the Μελίαι νύμφαι[497] of the ash trees are the mothers of the\nrace of men of the Iron Age. In northern mythology, Askr, the ash tree,\nis the primitive father. His wife, Embla, is the “Emsige,” the active\none, and not, as was earlier believed, the aspen. _Askr_ probably means,\nin the first place, the phallic spear of the ash tree. (Compare the\nSabine custom of parting the bride’s hair with the lance.) The Bundehesh\nsymbolizes the first people, Meschia and Meschiane, as the tree Reivas,\none part of which places a branch in a hole of the other part. The\nmaterial which, according to the northern myth, was animated by the god\nwhen he created men[498] is designated as _trê_ = wood, tree.[499] I\nrecall also ὕλη = wood, which in Latin is called _materia_. In the wood\nof the “world-ash,” Ygdrasil, a human pair hid themselves at the end of\nthe world, from whom sprang the race of the renewed world.[500] The Noah\nmotive is easily recognized in this conception (the night journey on the\nsea); at the same time, in the symbol of Ygdrasil, a mother idea is\nagain apparent. At the moment of the destruction of the world the\n“world-ash” becomes the guardian mother, the tree of death and life, one\n“ἐγκόλπιον.”[501][502] This function of rebirth of the “world-ash” also\nhelps to elucidate the representation met with in the Egyptian Book of\nthe Dead, which is called “the gate of knowledge of the soul of the\nEast”:\n\n  “I am the pilot in the holy keel, I am the steersman who allows no\n  rest in the ship of Râ.[503] I know that tree of emerald green from\n  whose midst Râ rises to the height of the clouds.”[504]\n\nShip and tree of the dead (death ship and death tree) are here closely\nconnected. The conception is that Râ, born from the tree, ascends\n(Osiris in the Erika). The representation of the sun-god Mithra is\nprobably explained in the same way. He is represented upon the\nHeddernheim relief, with half his body arising from the top of a tree.\n(In the same way numerous other monuments show Mithra half embodied in\nthe rock, and illustrate a rock birth, similar to Men.) Frequently there\nis a stream near the birthplace of Mithra. This conglomeration of\nsymbols is also found in the birth of Aschanes, the first Saxon king,\nwho grew from the Harz rocks, which are in the midst of the wood[505]\nnear a fountain.[506] Here we find all the mother symbols united—earth,\nwood, water, three forms of tangible matter. We can wonder no longer\nthat in the Middle Ages the tree was poetically addressed with the title\nof honor, “mistress.” Likewise it is not astonishing that the Christian\nlegend transformed the tree of death, the cross, into the tree of life,\nso that Christ was often represented on a living and fruit-bearing tree.\nThis reversion of the cross symbol to the tree of life, which even in\nBabylon was an important and authentic religious symbol, is also\nconsidered entirely probable by Zöckler,[507] an authority on the\nhistory of the cross. The pre-Christian meaning of the symbol does not\ncontradict this interpretation; on the contrary, its meaning is life.\nThe appearance of the cross in the sun worship (here the cross with\nequal arms, and the swastika cross, as representative of the sun’s\nrays), as well as in the cult of the goddess of love (Isis with the crux\nansata, the rope, the speculum veneris ♀, etc.), in no way contradicts\nthe previous historical meaning. The Christian legend has made abundant\nuse of this symbolism.\n\n[Illustration: CHRIST ON THE TREE OF LIFE]\n\nThe student of mediæval history is familiar with the representation of\nthe cross growing above the grave of Adam. The legend was that Adam was\nburied on Golgotha. Seth had planted on his grave a branch of the\n“paradise tree,” which became the cross and tree of death of\nChrist.[508] We all know that through Adam’s guilt sin and death came\ninto the world, and Christ through his death has redeemed us from the\nguilt. To the question in what had Adam’s guilt consisted it is said\nthat the unpardonable sin to be expiated by death was that he dared to\npick a fruit from the paradise tree.[509] The results of this are\ndescribed in an Oriental legend. One to whom it was permitted to cast\none look into Paradise after the fall saw the tree there and the four\nstreams. But the tree was withered, and in its branches lay an infant.\n(The mother had become pregnant.[510])\n\nThis remarkable legend corresponds to the Talmudic tradition that Adam,\nbefore Eve, already possessed a demon wife, by name Lilith, with whom he\n_quarrelled for mastership_. But Lilith raised herself into the air\nthrough the magic of the name of God and hid herself in the sea. Adam\nforced her back with the help of three angels.[511] Lilith became a\nnightmare, a Lamia, who threatened those with child and who kidnapped\nthe new-born child. The parallel myth is that of the Lamias, the\nspectres of the night, who terrified the children. The original legend\nis that Lamia enticed Zeus, but the jealous Hera, however, caused Lamia\nto bring only dead children into the world. Since that time the raging\nLamia is the persecutor of children, whom she destroys wherever she can.\nThis motive frequently recurs in fairy tales, where the mother often\nappears directly as a murderess or as a _devourer of men_;[512] a German\nparadigm is the well-known tale of Hansel and Gretel. Lamia is actually\na large, voracious fish, which establishes the connection with the\nwhale-dragon myth so beautifully worked out by Frobenius, in which the\nsea monster devours the sun-hero for rebirth and where the hero must\nemploy every stratagem to conquer the monster. Here again we meet with\nthe idea of the “terrible mother” in the form of the voracious fish, the\nmouth of death.[513] In Frobenius there are numerous examples where the\nmonster has devoured not only men but also animals, plants, an entire\ncountry, all of which are redeemed by the hero to a glorious rebirth.\n\nThe Lamias are typical nightmares, the feminine nature of which is\nabundantly proven.[514] Their universal peculiarity is that they ride\nupon their victims. Their counterparts are the spectral horses which\nbear their riders along in a mad gallop. One recognizes very easily in\nthese symbolic forms the type of anxious dream which, as Riklin\nshows,[515] has already become important for the interpretation of fairy\ntales through the investigation of Laistner.[516] The typical riding\ntakes on a special aspect through the results of the analytic\ninvestigation of infantile psychology; the two contributions of Freud\nand myself[517] have emphasized, on one side, the anxiety significance\nof the horse, on the other side the sexual meaning of the phantasy of\nriding. When we take these experiences into consideration, we need no\nlonger be surprised that the maternal “world-ash” Ygdrasil is called in\nGerman “the frightful horse.” Cannegieter[518] says of nightmares:\n\n  “Abigunt eas nymphas (matres deas, mairas) hodie rustici osse capitis\n  equini tectis injecto, cujusmodi ossa per has terras in rusticorum\n  villis crebra est animadvertere. Nocte autem ad concubia equitare\n  creduntur et equos fatigare ad longinqua itinera.”[519]\n\nThe connection of nightmare and horse seems, at first glance, to be\npresent also etymologically—nightmare and mare. The Indo-Germanic root\nfor märe is _mark_. Märe is the horse, English mare; Old High German\n_marah_ (male horse) and _meriha_ (female horse); Old Norse _merr_\n(_mara_ = nightmare); Anglo-Saxon _myre_ (_maira_). The French\n“cauchmar” comes from _calcare_ = to tread, to step (of iterative\nmeaning, therefore, “to tread” or press down). It was also said of the\ncock who stepped upon the hen. This movement is also typical for the\nnightmare; therefore, it is said of King Vanlandi, “Mara trad han,” the\nMara trod on him in sleep even to death.[520] A synonym for nightmare is\nthe “troll” or “treter”[521] (treader). This movement (_calcare_) is\nproven again by the experience of Freud and myself with children, where\na special infantile sexual significance is attached to stepping or\nkicking.\n\nThe common Aryan root _mar_ means “to die”; therefore, _mara_ the “dead”\nor “death.” From this results _mors_, μόρος = fate (also μοῖρα[522]). As\nis well known, the Nornes sitting under the “world-ash” personify fate\nlike Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. With the Celts the conception of the\nFates probably passes into that of _matres_ and _matronæ_, which had a\ndivine significance among the Germans. A well-known passage in Julius\nCæsar (“De Bello Gallico,” i: 50) informs us of this meaning of the\nmother:\n\n  “Ut matres familias eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus[523]\n  declararent, utrum prœlium committi ex usu esset, nec ne.”[524]\n\nIn Slav _mara_ means “witch”; poln. _mora_ = demon, nightmare; _mōr_ or\n_mōre_ (Swiss-German) means “sow,” also as an insult. The Bohemian\n_mura_ means “nightmare” and “evening moth, Sphinx.” This strange\nconnection is explained through analysis where it often occurs that\nanimals with movable shells (Venus shell) or wings are utilized for very\ntransparent reasons as symbols of the female genitals.[525] The\nSphingina are the twilight moths; they, like the nightmare, come in the\ndarkness. Finally, it is to be observed that the sacred olive tree of\nAthens is called “μορία” (that was derived from μόρος). Halirrhotios\nwished to cut down the tree, but killed himself with the axe in the\nattempt.\n\nThe sound resemblance of _mar_, _mère_ with _meer_ = sea and Latin\n_mare_ = sea is remarkable, although etymologically accidental. Might it\nrefer back to “the great primitive idea of the mother” who, in the first\nplace, meant to us our individual world and afterwards became the symbol\nof all worlds? Goethe said of the mothers: “They are encircled by images\nof all creatures.” The Christians, too, could not refrain from reuniting\ntheir mother of God with water. “Ave Maris stella” is the beginning of a\nhymn to Mary. Then again it is the horses of Neptune which symbolize the\nwaves of the sea. It is probably of importance that the infantile word\nma-ma (mother’s breast) is repeated in its initial sound in all possible\nlanguages, and that the mothers of two religious heroes are called Mary\nand Maya. That the mother is the horse of the child is to be seen most\nplainly in the primitive custom of carrying the child on the back or\nletting it ride on the hip. Odin hung on the “world-ash,” the mother,\nhis “horse of terror.” The Egyptian sun-god sits on the back of his\nmother, the heavenly cow.",
