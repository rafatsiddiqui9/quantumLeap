    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\

    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\

    \ same plane as Elias, without being identified with him,[375] although the people\
    \ consider him as Elias. The ascension places Christ as identical with Elias.\
    \ The prophecy of Christ shows that there exist aside from himself one or more\
    \ immortals who shall not die until Parousai. According to John xxi: 22nd verse,\
    \ the boy John was considered as one of these immortals, and in the legend he\
    \ is, in fact, not dead but merely sleeping in the ground until Parousai, and\
    \ breathes so that the dust swirls round his grave.[376] As is evident, there\
    \ are passable bridges from Christ by way of Elias to Chidher and Ahasuerus. It\
    \ is said in an account of this legend[377] that Dhulqarnein led his friend Chidher\
    \ to the “source of life” in order to have him drink of immortality.[378] Alexander\
    \ also bathed in the stream of life and performed the ritual ablutions. As I previously\
    \ mentioned in a footnote, according to Matthew xvii: 12th verse, John the Baptist\
    \ is Elias, therefore primarily identical with Chidher. Now, however, it is to\
    \ be noted that in the Arabian legend Chidher appears rather as a companion or\
    \ accompanied (Chidher with Dhulqarnein or with Elias, “like unto them”; or identified\
    \ with them[379]). There are therefore, two similar figures who resemble each\
    \ other, but who, nevertheless, are distinct. The analogous situation in the Christian\
    \ legend is found in the scene by the Jordan where John leads Christ to the “source\
    \ of life.” Christ is there, the subordinate, John the superior, similar to Dhulqarnein\
    \ and Chidher, or Chidher and Moses, also Elias. The latter relation especially\
    \ is such that Vollers compares Chidher and Elias, on the one side, with Gilgamesh\
    \ and his mortal brother Eabani; on the other side, with the Dioscuri, one of\
