{"paragraph": "In this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question whether the well-known longing for reality of the paranoic dement (and the dementia præcox patients),[245] to whom I have especially called attention in my book, “The Psychology of Dementia Præcox,”[246] is to be traced back to the withdrawal of the “libidinous affluxes” alone, or whether this coincides with the so-called objective interest in general. It is hardly to be assumed that the normal “fonction du réel” (Janet)[247] is maintained only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest. The fact is that in very many cases reality disappears entirely, so that not a trace of psychological adaptation or orientation can be recognized. Reality is repressed under these circumstances and replaced by the contents of the complex. One must of necessity say that not only the erotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared, that is to say, the whole adaptation to reality has ceased. To this category belong the stuporose and catatonic automatons.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does Freud mean by \"the whole adaptation to reality has ceased\" in his work?", "answer": "When Freud says that \"the whole adaptation to reality has ceased,\" it means that both the erotic interest and the general interest in reality have disappeared. This indicates a complete breakdown in the patient's ability to adapt to and engage with the real world, leading to a state where the patient is unable to orient themselves in reality.", "question_group_id": "2139f276-22f6-4034-aa43-4a6467572161", "paragraph_idx": 7, "question_idx": 2}
