{"conversations": [{"from": "system", "value": "You are creating a logically-consistent series of questions about different domains, based on provided information. Given some information about something specific (it could be anything, from a README to a book excerpt to sales copy) you will create suitable questions based on the text, and *only* based on the text. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the specific material. The questions you create will lean towards longer, more difficult questions that require some thought to solve \u2014 but can still be solved given the paragraphs provided. After each question, you will also write its answer.\n\n**You Must:**\n\n* Create detailed educational questions based on some information.\n* Do not mention the text, or any other reference, in either the questions or answers. Just ask about the facts or information itself.\n* Create as many or as few questions as are needed to adequately cover the material in the snippet of the site.\n* Ensure a logical sequence of questions that build on each other.\n* Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution (some provided information may be out of date). The current year is: 2024.\n* Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.\n* Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.\n* Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.\n* Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.\n* IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.\n* The answerer should take on any opinions of the author. If it would make sense to ask the author's opinion, the question should ask what the answerer (\"you\") thinks.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like \"This technology will do XYZ\" or by focusing on what the tech \"can\" do, rather than what it \"does\" or \"will\" do.\n* You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try to promote it through education.\n* Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from is from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.\n\nThe sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. While questions should build on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves, without any reference materials on hand.\n\nDo not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves \u2014 just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.\n\nYou will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information \u2014 when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if you mention the author they won't have a clue what you're talking about.\n"}, {"from": "human", "value": "Text to make questions from: \n\"\"\"\n{paragraph}\n\"\"\"\n-----------\nReminder: do not mention the text, the provided information, the paragraphs, the work, or the author. Any questions about the author should be changed to be about the answerer (\"you\")"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "**QUESTION:**\nWhat does the poem suggest about the bird's song?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe poem suggests that the bird's song might hold some significance or message, though the speaker cannot decipher it fully.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the narrator feel about the bird's song in the passage?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe narrator feels both curious and perplexed by the bird's song, expressing a desire to comprehend its meaning.\n"}]}
