    "paragraph": "Miss Miller\u2019s vision treats the problem of the sacrifice of the infantile longing, in the first place, as an individual problem, but if we cast a glance at the form of this presentation, then we will become aware that here it must concern something, which is also a problem of humanity in general. For the symbols employed, the serpent which killed the horse[807] and the hero voluntarily sacrificing himself, are primitive figures of phantasies and religious myths streaming up from the unconscious.In so far as the world and all within it is, above all, a thought, which is credited with transcendental \u201csubstance\u201d through the empirical need of the same, there results from the sacrifice of the regressive libido the creation of the world; and, psychologically speaking, the world in general. For him who looks backward the world, and even the infinite starry sky, is the mother[808] who bends over and encloses him on all sides, and from the renunciation of this idea and from the longing for this idea arises the image of the world. From this most simple fundamental thought, which perhaps appears strange to us only because it is conceived according to the _principle of desire and not the principle of reality_,[809] results the significance of the cosmic sacrifice. A good example of this is the slaying of the Babylonian primitive mother Ti\u00e2mat, the dragon, whose body is destined to form the heaven and the earth. We come upon this thought in its most complete form in Hindoo philosophy of the most ancient date; namely, in songs of Rigveda. In Rigveda 10: 81, 4, the song inquires:\u201cWhat was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they   fashioned out the earth and heaven? Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit, whereon he stood when he   established all things.\u201dVi\u00e7vakarman, the All-Creator, who created the world from the unknown tree, did so as follows:",

    "question": "How does Miss Miller describe the creation of the world in relation to the sacrifice of regressive libido?\n\n**ANSARS:**\nMiss Miller suggests that the sacrifice of regressive libido, or the renunciation of certain desires, results in the creation of the world. In her view, the world and all within it is fundamentally a thought that gains substance through empirical needs. This sacrifice leads to the conceptual formation of the world and even the infinite starry sky, which for someone looking back symbolizes a mother figure bending over and enclosing them from all sides. The longing for this mother figure leads to the image of the world.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the significance of the cosmic sacrifice according to Miss Miller, and can you provide an example?",
    "answer": "The significance of the cosmic sacrifice, according to Miss Miller, lies in the idea that the sacrifice of regressive libido leads to the creation of the universe. A good example is the slaying of the Babylonian primitive mother Ti\u00e2mat, the dragon, whose body is destined to form the heaven and the earth. This concept is also found in ancient Hindu philosophy, specifically in the Rigveda, where it is described in songs like Rigveda 10: 81, 4.",
