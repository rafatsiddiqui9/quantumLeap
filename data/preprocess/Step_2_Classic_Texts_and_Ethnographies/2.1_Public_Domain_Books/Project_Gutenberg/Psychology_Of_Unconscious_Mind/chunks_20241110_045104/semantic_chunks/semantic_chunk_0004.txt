Cultural Significance

The Oedipus problem has had a profound impact on Western culture, and it continues to be a popular topic of discussion and debate today. The story has been retold and reinterpreted in many different forms of art and literature, including plays, novels, and films.

The Oedipus problem has also had a significant impact on psychology and psychoanalysis, with Sigmund Freud using the story as a case study to explore the human psyche.
