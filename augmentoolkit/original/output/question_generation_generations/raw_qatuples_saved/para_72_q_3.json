    "paragraph": "the dog!) Thus the crevice at Delphi, with the spring, Castalia, was the seat of the chthonic dragon, Python, who was conquered by the sun-hero, Apollo. (Python, incited by Hera, pursued Leta, pregnant with Apollo; but she, on the floating island of Delos [nocturnal journey on the sea], gave birth to her child, who later slew the Python; that is to say, conquered in it the spirit mother.) In Hierapolis (Edessa) the temple was erected above the crevice through which the flood had poured out, and in Jerusalem the foundation stone of the temple covered the great abyss,[735] just as Christian churches are frequently built over caves, grottoes, wells, etc. In the Mithra grotto,[736] and all the other sacred caves up to the Christian catacombs, which owe their significance not to the legendary persecutions but to the worship of the dead,[737] we come across the same fundamental motive. The burial of the dead in a holy place (in the \u201cgarden of the dead,\u201d in cloisters, crypts, etc.) is restitution to the mother, with the certain hope of resurrection by which such burial is rightfully rewarded. The animal of death which dwells in the cave had to be soothed in early times through human sacrifices; later with natural gifts.[738] Therefore, the Attic custom gives to the dead the \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1, to pacify the dog of hell, the three-headed monster at the gate of the underworld. A more recent elaboration of the natural gifts seems to be the obolus for Charon, who is, therefore, designated by Rohde as the second Cerberus, corresponding to the Egyptian dog-faced god Anubis.[739] Dog and serpent of the underworld (Dragon) are likewise identical. In the tragedies, the Erinnyes are serpents as well as dogs; the serpents Tychon and Echnida are parents of the serpents\u2014Hydra, the dragon of the Hesperides, and Gorgo; and of the dogs, Cerberus, Orthrus, Scylla.[740] Serpents and dogs are also protectors of the treasure.",

    "answer": "Early humans attempted to pacify the animal of death dwelling in a cave through human sacrifices. Over time, this practice evolved to the use of natural gifts as a way to soothe the animal. In Athens, the custom involved giving \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1 (honey) to the dead to pacify the dog of hell, which is mentioned in the text.",
