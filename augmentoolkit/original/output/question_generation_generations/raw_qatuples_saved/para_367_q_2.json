    "paragraph": "A parallel figure to Mithra is the primitive man Gayomard. He was created together with his bull, and the two lived for six thousand years in a blissful state. But when the world came into the cycle of the seventh sign of the Zodiac (Libra) the evil principle entered. Libra is astrologically the so-called positive domicile of Venus; the evil principle, therefore, came under the dominion of the goddess of love (destruction of the sun-hero through the mother-wife\u2014snake, whore, etc). As a result, after thirty years, Gayomard and his bull died. (The trials of Zartusht lasted also thirty years; compare the span of Christ\u2019s life.) Fifty-five species of grain came from the dead bull, twelve kinds of salubrious plants, etc. The sperma of the bull entered into the moon for purification, but the sperma of Gayomard entered into the sun. This circumstance possibly suggests a rather feminine meaning of bull. Gosh or Drv\u00e2\u00e7pa is the soul of the bull, and was worshipped as a female divinity. She would not, at first, from diffidence, become the goddess of the herds, until the coming of Zarathustra was announced to her as consolation. This has its parallel in the Hindoo Pur\u00e2na, where the coming of Krishna was promised the earth. (A complete analogy to Christ.[829]) She, too, travels in her chariot, like Ardv\u00ee\u00e7\u00fbra, the goddess of love. The soul of the bull is, therefore, decidedly feminine. This myth of Gayomard repeats only in an altered form the primitive conception of the closed ring of a male-female divinity, self-begetting and forth-bringing.Like the sacrificial bull, the fire, the sacrifice of which we have already discussed in Chapter III, has a feminine nature among the Chinese, according to the commentaries[830] of the philosopher Tschwang-Tse:\u201cThe spirit of the hearth is called Ki. He is clad in bright red,  which resembles fire, and appears as a lovely, attractive maiden.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the myth of Gayomard suggest about the role of the bull in this context?",
    "answer": "The myth of Gayomard suggests that the bull, along with its sperm, plays a crucial role in the creation of various species and plants. The sperm of the bull entered the moon for purification, while the sperm of Gayomard entered the sun. This suggests a symbolic feminine aspect of the bull, as its sperm is associated with the moon and purification.",
