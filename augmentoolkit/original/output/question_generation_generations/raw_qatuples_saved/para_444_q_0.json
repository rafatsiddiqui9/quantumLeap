    "paragraph": "\u201cThis small poem made a profound impression upon me. I could not, of  course, find immediately a sufficiently clear and direct explanation  for it. However, a few days later when I once more read a certain  philosophical work, which I had read in Berlin the previous winter,  and which I had enjoyed very much, (I was reading it aloud to a  friend), I came across the following words: \u2018La m\u00eame aspiration  passionn\u00e9e de la mite vers l\u2019\u00e9toile, de l\u2019homme vers Dieu.\u2019 (The same  passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God.) I had  forgotten this sentence entirely, but it seemed very clear to me that  precisely these words had reappeared in my hypnagogic poem. In  addition to that it occurred to me that a play seen some years  previously, \u2018La Mite et La Flamme,\u2019 was a further possible cause of  the poem. It is easy to see how often the word \u2018moth\u2019 had been  impressed upon me.\u201dThe deep impression made by the poem upon the author shows that she put into it a large amount of love. In the expression \u201caspiration passionn\u00e9e\u201d we meet the passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God, and indeed, the moth is Miss Miller herself. Her last observation that the word \u201cmoth\u201d was often impressed upon her shows how often she had noticed the word \u201cmoth\u201d as applicable to herself. _Her longing for God resembles the longing of the moth for the \u201cstar.\u201d_ The reader will recall that this expression has already had a place in the earlier material, \u201cwhen the morning stars sang together,\u201d that is to say, the ship\u2019s officer who sings on deck in the night watch. The passionate longing for God is the same as that longing for the singing morning stars. It was pointed out at great length in the foregoing chapter that this analogy is to be expected: \u201cSic parvis componere magna solebam.\u201d",

    "question": "How did a phrase from a philosophical work contribute to the creation of a poem, and what did the author believe was the significance of this phrase?",
    "answer": "A phrase from a philosophical work, \"La m\u00eame aspiration passionn\u00e9e de la mite vers l\u2019\u00e9toile, de l\u2019homme vers Dieu\" (The same passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God), significantly influenced the author. The author realized that this phrase reappeared in a hypnagogic poem she had written, reinforcing its deep significance.",
