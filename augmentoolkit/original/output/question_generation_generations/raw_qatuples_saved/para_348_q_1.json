    "paragraph": "We see that in Miss Miller the religious hymn arising from the unconscious is the compensating amend for the erotic; it takes a great part of its materials from the infantile reminiscences which she reawakened into life by the introversion of the libido. Had this religious creation not succeeded (and also had another sublimated application been eliminated) then Miss Miller would have yielded to the erotic impression, either to its natural consequence or to a negative issue, which would have replaced the lost success in love by a correspondingly strong sorrow. It is well known that opinions are much divided concerning the worth of this issue of an erotic conflict, such as Miss Miller has presented to us. It is thought to be much more beautiful to solve unnoticed an erotic tension, in the elevated feelings of religious poetry, in which perhaps many other people can find joy and consolation. One is wrong to storm against this conception from the radical standpoint of fanaticism for truth.I think that one should view with philosophic admiration the strange paths of the libido and should investigate the purposes of its circuitous ways.",

    "answer": "If Miss Miller had not successfully transformed her erotic impulses into a religious hymn, she would have likely given in to the erotic impression either to its natural consequence or to a negative issue. This negative issue would have replaced the lost success in love with a strong sorrow.",
