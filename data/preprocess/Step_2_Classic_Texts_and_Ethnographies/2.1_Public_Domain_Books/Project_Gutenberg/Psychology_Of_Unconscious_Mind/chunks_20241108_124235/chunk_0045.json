That is, Horus vanquished the evil Typhon, who\nmurdered Osiris treacherously (terrible mother = Typhon). Isis,\n_however, set him free again_. Horus thereupon rebelled, _laid hands on\nhis mother and tore the regal ornaments from her head_, whereupon Hermes\ngave her a cow’s head. Then Horus conquered Typhon a second time.\nTyphon, in the Greek legend, is a monstrous dragon. Even without this\nconfirmation it is evident that the battle of Horus is the typical\nbattle of the sun-hero with the whale-dragon. Of the latter we know that\nit is a symbol of the “dreadful mother,” of the voracious jaws of death,\nwhere men are dismembered and ground up.[526] Whoever vanquishes this\nmonster has gained a new or eternal youth. For this purpose one must, in\nspite of all dangers, descend into the belly of the monster[527]\n(journey to hell) and spend some time there. (Imprisonment by night in\nthe sea.)\n\nThe battle with the night serpent signifies, therefore, the conquering\nof the mother, who is suspected of an infamous crime, that is, the\nbetrayal of the son. A full confirmation of the connection comes to us\nthrough the fragment of the Babylonian epic of the creation, discovered\nby George Smith, mostly from the library of Asurbanipal. The period of\nthe origin of the text was probably in the time of Hammurabi (2,000\nB.C.). We learn from this account of creation[528] that the sun-god Ea,\nthe son of the depths of the waters and the god of wisdom,[529] had\nconquered Apsû. Apsû is the creator of the great gods (he existed in the\nbeginning in a sort of trinity with Tiâmat—the mother of gods and Mumu,\nhis vizier). Ea conquered the father, but Tiâmat plotted revenge. She\nprepared herself for battle against the gods.\n\n    “Mother Hubur, who created everything,\n    Procured invincible weapons, gave birth to giant snakes\n    With pointed teeth, relentless in every way;\n    Filled their bellies with poison instead of blood,\n    Furious gigantic lizards, clothed them with horrors,\n    Let them swell with the splendor of horror, formed them rearing,\n    Whoever sees them shall die of terror.\n    Their bodies shall rear without turning to escape.\n    She arrayed the lizards, dragons and Laḫamen,\n    Hurricanes, mad dogs, scorpion men,\n    Mighty storms, fishmen and rams.\n    With relentless weapons, without fear of conflict,\n    Powerful are Tiâmat’s commands, irresistible are they.\n\n    “After Tiâmat had powerfully done her work\n    She conceived evil against the gods, her descendants;\n    In order to revenge Apsu, Tiâmat did evil.\n    When Ea now heard this thing\n    He became painfully anxious, sorrowfully he sat himself.\n    He went to the father, his creator, Ans̆ar,\n    To relate to him all that Tiâmat plotted.\n    Tiâmat, our mother, has taken an aversion to us,\n    Has prepared a riotous mob, furiously raging.”\n\nThe gods finally opposed Marduk, the god of spring, the victorious sun,\nagainst the fearful host of Tiâmat. Marduk prepared for battle. Of his\nchief weapon, which he created, it is said:\n\n “He created the evil wind, Imḫullu, the south storm and the hurricane,\n The fourth wind, the seventh wind, the whirlwind and the harmful wind,\n Then let he loose the winds, which he had created, the seven:\n To cause confusion within Tiâmat, they followed behind him,\n Then the lord took up the cyclone, his great weapon;\n For his chariot he mounted the stormwind, the incomparable, the terrible\n    one.”\n\nHis chief weapon is the wind and a net, with which he will entangle\nTiâmat. He approaches Tiâmat and challenges her to a combat.\n\n   “Then Tiâmat and Marduk, the wise one of the gods, came together,\n   Rising for the fight, approaching to the battle:\n   Then the lord spread out his net and caught her.\n   He let loose the Imḫullu in his train at her face,\n   Then Tiâmat now opened her mouth as wide as she could.\n   He let the Imḫullu rush in so that her lips could not close;\n   With the raging winds he filled her womb.\n   Her inward parts were seized and she opened wide her mouth.\n   He touched her with the spear, dismembered her body,\n   He slashed her inward parts, and cut out her heart,\n   Subdued her and put an end to her life.\n   He threw down her body and stepped upon it.”\n\nAfter Marduk slew the mother, he devised the creation of the world.\n\n         “There the lord rested contemplating her body,\n         Then divided he the Colossus, planning wisely.\n         He cut it apart like a flat fish, into two parts,[530]\n         One half he took and with it he covered the Heavens.”\n\nIn this manner Marduk created the universe from the mother. It is\nclearly evident that the killing of the mother-dragon here takes place\nunder the idea of a wind fecundation with negative accompaniments.\n\nThe world is created from the mother, that is to say, from the libido\ntaken away from the mother through sacrifice. We shall have to consider\nthis significant formula more closely in the last chapter. The most\ninteresting parallels to this primitive myth are to be found in the\nliterature of the Old Testament, as Gunkel[531] has brilliantly pointed\nout. It is worth while to trace the psychology of these parallels.\n\n  _Isaiah_ li:9:\n\n  (9) “Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the\n  ancient days, in the generation of old. Art thou not it that hath cut\n  Rahab, and wounded the dragon?\n\n  (10) “Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the\n  great deep, that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the\n  ransomed to pass over?”\n\nThe name of Rahab is frequently used for Egypt in the Old Testament,\nalso dragon. _Isaiah_, chapter xxx, verse 7, calls Egypt “the silent\nRahab,” and means, therefore, something evil and hostile. Rahab is the\nwell-known whore of Jericho, who later, as the wife of Prince Salma,\nbecame the ancestress of Christ. Here Rahab appeared as the old dragon,\nas Tiâmat, against whose evil power Marduk, or Jehovah, marched forth.\nThe expression “the ransomed” refers to the Jews freed from bondage, but\nit is also mythological, for the hero again frees those previously\ndevoured by the whale. (Frobenius.)\n\n  _Psalm_, lxxxix:10:\n\n  “Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain.”\n\n  _Job_ xxvi:12–13:\n\n  “He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he\n  smiteth through the proud.\n\n  “By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens, his hand hath formed the\n  crooked serpent.”\n\nGunkel places Rahab as identical with Chaos, that is, the same as\nTiâmat. Gunkel translates “the breaking to pieces” as “violation.”\nTiâmat or Rahab as the mother is also the whore. Gilgamesh treats Ishtar\nin this way when he accuses her of whoredom. This insult towards the\nmother is very familiar to us from dream analysis. The dragon Rahab\nappears also as Leviathan, the water monster (maternal sea).\n\n  _Psalm_ lxxiv:\n\n  (13) “Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the\n  heads of the dragons in the waters.\n\n  (14) “Thou brakest the heads of Leviathan in pieces and gavest him to\n  be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.\n\n  (15) “Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou didst dry up\n  mighty rivers.”\n\nWhile only the phallic meaning of the Leviathan was emphasized in the\nfirst part of this work, we now discover also the maternal meaning. A\nfurther parallel is:\n\n  _Isaiah_ xxvii:1:\n\n  “In that day, the Lord with his cruel and great and strong sword shall\n  punish Leviathan, the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked\n  serpent, and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.”\n\nWe come upon a special motive in Job, chap. xli, v. 1:\n\n  “Canst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord\n  which thou lettest down? Canst thou put an hook in his nose? or bore\n  his jaw through with a thorn?”\n\nNumerous parallels to this motive are to be found among exotic myths in\nFrobenius, where the maternal sea monster was also fished for. The\ncomparison of the mother libido with the elementary powers of the sea\nand the powerful monsters borne by the earth show how invincibly great\nis the power of that libido which we designate as maternal.\n\nWe have already seen that the incest prohibition prevents the son from\nreproducing himself through the mother. But this must be done by the\ngod, as is shown with remarkable clearness and candor in the pious\nEgyptian mythology, which has preserved the most ancient and simple\nconcepts. Thus Chnum, the “moulder,” the “potter,” the “architect,”\nmoulds his egg upon the potter’s wheel, for he is “the immortal growth,”\n“the reproduction of himself and his own rebirth, the creator of the\negg, which emerged from the primitive waters.” In the Book of the Dead\nit says:\n\n  “I am the sublime falcon (the Sun-god), which has come forth from his\n  egg.”\n\nAnother passage in the Book of the Dead reads:\n\n  “I am the creator of Nun, who has taken his place in the underworld.\n  My nest is not seen and my egg is not broken.”\n\nA further passage reads:\n\n  “that great and noble god in his egg: who is his own originator of\n  that which has arisen from him.”[532]\n\nTherefore, the god Nagaga-uer is also called the “great cackler.” (Book\nof the Dead.) “I cackle like a goose and I whistle like a falcon.” The\nmother is reproached with the incest prohibition as an act of wilful\nmaliciousness by which she excludes the son from immortality. Therefore,\na god must at least rebel, overpower and chastise the mother. (Compare\nAdam and Lilith, above.) The “overpowering” signifies incestuous\nrape.[533] Herodotus[534] has preserved for us a valuable fragment of\nthis religious phantasy.\n\n  “And how they celebrate their feast to Isis in the city of Busiris, I\n  have already previously remarked. After the sacrifice, all of them,\n  men and women, full ten thousand people, begin to beat each other. But\n  it would be sin for me to mention for whom they do beat each other.\n\n  “But in Papremis they celebrated the sacrifice with holy actions, as\n  in the other places. About the time when the sun sets, some few\n  priests are busy around the image; most of them stand at the entrance\n  with wooden clubs, and others who would fulfil a vow, more than a\n  thousand men, also stand in a group with wooden cudgels opposite them.\n\n  “Now on the eve of the festival, they take the image out in a small\n  and gilded temple into another sacred edifice. Then the few who remain\n  with the image draw a four-wheeled chariot upon which the temple\n  stands with the image which it encloses. But the others who stand in\n  the anterooms are not allowed to enter. Those under a vow, who stand\n  by the god, beat them off. Now occurs a furious battle with clubs, in\n  which they bruise each other’s bodies and as I believe, many even die\n  from their wounds: notwithstanding this, the Egyptians consider that\n  none die.\n\n  “The natives claim that this festival gathering was introduced for the\n  following reason: in this sanctuary lived the mother of Ares.[535] Now\n  Ares was brought up abroad and when he became a man he came to have\n  _intercourse with his mother_. The servants of his mother who had seen\n  him did not allow him to enter peacefully, but prevented him; at which\n  he fetched people from another city, who mistreated the servants and\n  had entrance to his mother. Therefore, they asserted that this\n  slaughter was introduced at the feast for Ares.”",
