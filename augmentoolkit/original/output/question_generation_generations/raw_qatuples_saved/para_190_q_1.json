About the time when the sun sets, some few  priests are busy around the image; most of them stand at the entrance  with wooden clubs, and others who would fulfil a vow, more than a  thousand men, also stand in a group with wooden cudgels opposite them.\u201cNow on the eve of the festival, they take the image out in a small  and gilded temple into another sacred edifice.

But the others who stand in  the anterooms are not allowed to enter. Those under a vow, who stand  by the god, beat them off.

The small and gilded temple is significant because it is the original place where the image resides, and the act of moving it to another sacred edifice is part of the ritual process leading up to the festival.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nDescribe the role of those under a vow during the festival at Papremis.",
    "answer": "Those under a vow who stand by the god are responsible for preventing others from entering the sacred edifice where the image is located. They beat off the priests and others who try to enter, leading to a violent battle with clubs. This battle is a central part of the festival and involves bruising and potentially deadly wounds.",
