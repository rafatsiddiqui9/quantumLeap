  "original_text": "Of Mithra it is said: ὄψει θεὸν ὑπερμεγέθη, φωτινὴν ἔχοντα τὴν ὄψιν,\nνεώτερον, χρυσοκόμαν, ἐν χιτῶνι λευκῳ καὶ χρυσῳ στεφάνῳ καὶ ἀναξυρίσι,\nκατέχοντα τῇ δεξιᾷ χειρὶ μόσχου ὦμόν χρύσεον, ὅς ἐστιν ἄρκτος ἡ κινοῦσα\nκαὶ ἀντιστρέφουσα τὸν οὐρανόν, κατὰ ὥραν ἀναπολεύουσα καὶ καταπολεύουσα.\nἔπειτα ὄψει αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν ὀμμάτων ἀστραπὰς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ σώματος ἀστέρας\nἁλλομένους.[161]\n\nIf we place fire and gold as essentially similar, then a great accord is\nfound in the attributes of the two gods. To these mystical pagan ideas\nthere deserve to be added the probably almost contemporaneous vision of\nRevelation:\n\n  “And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks. And in the midst\n  of the candlesticks[162] one like unto the son of man, clothed with a\n  garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden\n  girdle. And his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as\n  snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire. And his feet like unto\n  burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice\n  as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven\n  stars,[163] and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged\n  sword,[164] and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his\n  strength.”—_Rev._ i: 12 ff.\n\n  “And I looked, and beheld a white cloud, and upon the cloud I saw one\n  sitting like unto the son of man, having on his head a golden crown,\n  and in his hand a sharp sickle.”[165]—_Rev._ xiv: 14.\n\n  “And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and upon his head were many\n  diadems. And he was arrayed in a garment[166] sprinkled with blood....\n  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,\n  clothed in fine linen,[167] white and pure. And out of his mouth\n  proceeded a sharp sword.”—_Rev._ xix: 12–15.\n\nOne need not assume that there is a direct dependency between the\nApocalypse and the Mithraic liturgy. The visionary images of both texts\nare developed from a source, not limited to one place, but found in the\nsoul of many divers people, because the symbols which arise from it are\ntoo typical for it to belong to one individual only. I put these images\nhere to show how the primitive symbolism of light gradually developed,\nwith the increasing depth of the vision, into the idea of the sun-hero,\nthe “well-beloved.”[168] The development of the symbol of light is\nthoroughly typical. In addition to this, perhaps I might call to mind\nthe fact that I have previously pointed out this course with numerous\nexamples,[169] and, therefore, I can spare myself the trouble of\nreturning to this subject.[170] These visionary occurrences are the\npsychological roots of the sun-coronations in the mysteries. Its rite is\nreligious hallucination congealed into liturgical form, which, on\naccount of its great regularity, could become a generally accepted outer\nform. After all this, it is easily understood how the ancient Christian\nChurch, on one side, stood in an especial bond to Christ as “sol novus,”\nand, on the other side, had a certain difficulty in freeing itself from\nthe earthly symbols of Christ. Indeed Philo of Alexandria saw in the sun\nthe image of the divine logos or of the Deity especially (“De Somniis,”\n1:85). In an Ambrosian hymn Christ is invoked by “O sol salutis,” and so\non. At the time of Marcus Aurelius, Meliton, in his work,[171] περὶ\nλούτρου, called Christ the Ἥλιος ἀνατολης ... μόνος ἥλιος οὗτος\nἀνέτειλεν ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ.[172]\n\nStill more important is a passage from Pseudo-Cyprian:[173]\n\n  “O quam præclara providentia ut illo die quo factus est sol, in ipso\n  die nasceretur Christus, v. Kal. Apr. feria IV, et ideo de ipso ad\n  plebem dicebat Malachias propheta: ‘Orietur vobis sol iustitiæ et\n  curatio est in pennis ejus,’ hic est sol iustitiæ cuius in pennis\n  curatio præostendebatur.”[174][175]\n\nIn a work nominally attributed to John Chrysostomus, “De Solstitiis et\nAequinoctiis,”[176] occurs this passage:\n\n  “Sed et dominus nascitur mense Decembri hiemis tempore, VIII. Kal.\n  Januarias, quando oleæ maturæ præmuntur ut unctio, id est Chrisma,\n  nascatur—sed et Invicti natalem appellant. Quis utique tam invictus\n  nisi dominus noster qui mortem subactam devicit? Vel quod dicant Solis\n  esse natalem, ipse est sol iustitiæ, de quo Malachias propheta dixit:\n  ‘Dominus lucis ac noctis conditor et discretor qui a propheta Sol\n  iustitiæ cognominatus est.’”[177]\n\nAccording to the testimony of Eusebius of Alexandria, the Christians\nalso shared in the worship of the rising sun, which lasted into the\nfifth century:\n\n  οὐαῖ τοῖς προσκυνοῦσι τὸν ἥλιον καὶ τὴν σελήνην καὶ τοὺς ἀστέρας.\n  Πολλοὺς γὰρ οἶδα τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας καὶ εὐχομένους εἰς τὸν ἥλιον. Ἤδη\n  γὰρ ἀνατείλαντος τοῦ ἡλίου, προσεύχονται καὶ λέγουσιν “Ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς”\n  καὶ οὐ μόνον Ἡλιογνώσται καὶ αἱρετικοὶ τοῦτο ποιοῦσιν ἀλλὰ καὶ\n  χριστιανοὶ καὶ ἀφέντες τὴν πίστιν τοῖς αἱρετικοῖς συναμίγνυνται.[178]\n\nAugustine preached emphatically to the Christians:\n\n  “Non est Dominus Sol factus sed per quem Sol factus est—ne quis\n  carnaliter sapiens Solem istum (Christum) intelligendum putaret.”\n\nArt has preserved much of the remnants of sun-worship,[179] thus the\nnimbus around the head of Christ and the halo of the saints in general.\nThe Christian legends also attribute many fire and light symbols to the\nsaints.[180] The twelve apostles, for example, are likened to the twelve\nsigns of the zodiac, and are represented, therefore, with a star over\nthe head.[181]\n\nIt is not to be wondered at that the heathen, as Tertullian avows,\nconsidered the sun as the Christian God. Among the Manichaeans God was\nreally the sun. One of the most remarkable works extant, where the\nPagan, Asiatic, Hellenic and Christian intermingle, is the Ἐξήγησις περὶ\nτων ἐν Περσίδι πραχθέντων, edited by Wirth.[182] This is a book of\nfables, but, nevertheless, a mine for near-Christian phantasies, which\ngives a profound insight into Christian symbolism. In this is found the\nfollowing magical dedication: Διὶ Ἡλίῳ θεῳ μεγάλῳ βασιλεῖ Ἰησοῦ—.[183]\nIn certain parts of Armenia the rising sun is still worshipped by\nChristians, that “it may let its foot rest upon the faces of the\nworshippers.”[184] The foot occurs as an anthropomorphic attribute, and\nwe have already met the theriomorphic attribute in the feathers and the\nsun phallus. Other comparisons of the sun’s ray, as knife, sword, arrow,\nand so on, have also, as we have learned from the psychology of the\ndream, a phallic meaning at bottom. This meaning is attached to the foot\nas I here point out,[185] and also to the feathers, or hair, of the sun,\nwhich signify the power or strength of the sun. I refer to the story of\nSamson, and to that of the Apocalypse of Baruch, concerning the phœnix\nbird, which, flying before the sun, loses its feathers, and, exhausted,\nis strengthened again in an ocean bath at evening.\n\nUnder the symbol of “moth and sun” we have dug down into the historic\ndepths of the soul, and in doing this we have uncovered an old buried\nidol, the youthful, beautiful, fire-encircled and halo-crowned sun-hero,\nwho, forever unattainable to the mortal, wanders upon the earth, causing\nnight to follow day; winter, summer; death, life; and who returns again\nin rejuvenated splendor and gives light to new generations. The longing\nof the dreamer concealed behind the moth stands for him.",
