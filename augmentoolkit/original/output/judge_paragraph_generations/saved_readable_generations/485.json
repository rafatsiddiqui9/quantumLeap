{"paragraph": "\u201cYe fools and blind men, behold God has created man in his image, as  male and female, and has blessed them and said, \u2018Be fruitful and  multiply and fill the earth, and make it subject to thee.\u2019 Therefore,  he has given the greatest honor to these poor members and has placed  them naked in the garden,\u201d etc.\u201cNow are the fig leaves and the covering removed, because thou hast  turned to the Lord, for the Lord is the Spirit, and where the spirit  of the Lord is, there is freedom,[755] there the clearness of the Lord  is mirrored with uncovered countenance. This is precious before God,  and this is the glory of the Lord, and the adornment of our God, when  you stand in the image and honor of your God, as God created you,  naked and not ashamed.\u201cWho can ever praise sufficiently in the sons and daughters of the  living God those parts of the body which are destined to procreate?\u201cIn the lap of the daughters of Jerusalem is the gate of the Lord, and  the Just will go into the temple there, to the altar.[756] And in the  lap of the sons of the living God is the water-pipe of the upper part,  which is a tube, like a rod, to measure the temple and altar. And  under the water-tube the sacred stones are placed, as a sign and  testimony of the Lord, who has taken to himself the seed of Abraham.\u201cOut of the seeds in the chamber of the mother, God creates a man with  his hands, as an image of himself. Then the mother house and the  mother chamber is opened in the daughters of the Living God, and God  himself brings forth a child through them. Thus God creates children  from the stones, for the seed comes from the stones.\u201d[757]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
