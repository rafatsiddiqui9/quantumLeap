    "paragraph": "It is evident that by this is meant not a physical, but a psychological cosmogony. The world arises when man discovers it. He discovers it when he sacrifices the mother; that is to say, when he has freed himself from the midst of his unconscious lying in the mother. That which impels him forward to this discovery may be interpreted psychologically as the so-called \u201cIncest barrier\u201d of Freud. The incest prohibition places an end to the childish longing for the food-giving mother, and compels the libido, gradually becoming sexual, into the path of the biological aim. The libido forced away from the mother by the incest prohibition seeks for the sexual object in the place of the forbidden mother. In this wider psychologic sense, which expresses itself in the allegoric language of the \u201cincest prohibition,\u201d \u201cmother,\u201d etc., must be understood Freud\u2019s paradoxical sentence, \u201cOriginally we have known only sexual objects.\u201d[811] This sentence must be understood psychologically throughout, in the sense of a world image created from within outwards, which has, in the first place, nothing to do with the so-called \u201cobjective\u201d idea of the world. This is to be understood as a new edition of the subjective idea of the world corrected by reality. Biology, as a science of objective experience, would have to reject unconditionally Freud\u2019s proposition, for, as we have made clear above, the function of reality can only be partly sexual; in another equally important part it is self-preservation. The matter appears different for that thought which accompanies the biological function as an epiphenomenon. As far as our knowledge reaches, the individual act of thought is dependent wholly or in greatest part on the existence of a highly differentiated brain, whereas the function of reality (adaptation to reality) is something which occurs in all living nature as wholly independent from the act of thought.",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about Freud's proposition that \"Originally we have known only sexual objects\" and how should it be understood?",
    "answer": "The text suggests that Freud's proposition should be understood psychologically throughout, as a new edition of the subjective idea of the world corrected by reality. It implies that this idea is a subjective world image created from within outwards, and it is not to be understood in the context of objective reality as described by biology.",
