    "paragraph": "This proud sentence, which naturally only a woman can express, because man is not accustomed to boast in that direction, again confirms the fact that all enterprises have remained but dreams, that the body has remained \u201cinviolate.\u201d When the hero visits the heroine in a dream, it is clear what is meant. This assertion of the hero\u2019s, that he has remained inviolate, refers back to the unsuccessful attempt upon his life in the previous chapter (huntsman with the arrow), and clearly explains to us what was really meant by this assault; that is to say, the refusal of the coitus phantasy. Here the wish of the unconscious obtrudes itself again, after the hero had repressed it the first time, and thereupon he painfully and hysterically utters this monologue. \u201cTemptation will often assail her soul\u2014but it will not yield.\u201d This very bold assertion reduces\u2014noblesse oblige\u2014the unconscious to an enormous infantile megalomania, which is always the case when the libido is compelled, through similar circumstances, to regressions. \u201cOnly once in all the ten thousand moons is a soul born like mine!\u201d Here the unconscious ego expands to an enormous degree, evidently in order to cover with its boastfulness a large part of the neglected duty of life.

In accordance with this, and in logical continuation of the same, all that follows is expressed in figurative speech.

    "answer": "The comparison is made between the hero's attitude and that of some savage women, who pride themselves on the numerous scars they have received from their men during sexual conflicts. The hero's boastful assertion of remaining unharmed is contrasted with the women's display of their scars, which affirm their real and physical involvement in such conflicts. This comparison highlights the hero's perceived lack of genuine engagement in the \"firing-line\" of life's battles.",
