    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ individuals at first manifests itself in the nutritional zone, when food is\
    \ taken in the act of suckling with rhythmic movements and with every sign of\
    \ satisfaction. With the growth of the individual and the development of his organs\
    \ the libido creates for itself new avenues to supply its need of activity and\
    \ satisfaction. The primary model of rhythmic activity, producing pleasure and\
    \ satisfaction, must now be transferred to the zone of other functions, with sexuality\
    \ as its final goal. A considerable part of the “hunger libido” is transferred\
    \ into the “sexual libido.” This transition does not take place suddenly at the\
    \ time of puberty, as is generally supposed, but very gradually in the course\
    \ of the greater part of childhood. The libido can free itself only with difficulty\
    \ and very slowly from that which is peculiar to the function of nutrition, in\
    \ order to enter into the peculiarity of the sexual function. Two periods are\
    \ to be distinguished in this state of transition, so far as I can judge—_the\
    \ epoch of suckling and the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity_. Suckling\
    \ still belongs to the function of nutrition, but passes beyond it, however, in\
    \ that it is no longer the function of nutrition, but rhythmic activity, with\
    \ pleasure and satisfaction as a goal, without the taking of nourishment. Here\
    \ the hand enters as an auxiliary organ. In the period of the displaced rhythmic\
    \ activity the hand appears still more clearly as an auxiliary organ; the gaining\
    \ of pleasure leaves the mouth zone and turns to other regions. The possibilities\
    \ are now many. As a rule, other openings of the body become the objects of the\
    \ libido interest; then the skin, and special portions of that. The activity expressed\
    \ in these parts, which can appear as rubbing, boring, picking, and so on, follows\
    \ a certain rhythm and serves to produce pleasure.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based\
    \ on text): \"\"\"How does the libido adapt as the individual grows and develops?\"\
