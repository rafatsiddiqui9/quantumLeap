The three  signify for us, the Holy Trinity and the fourth, the unity of the  being. Christ, too, in His explanation designated the person of the  Trinity and the unity of the being.\u201dAccording to this mystic interpretation, the legend of the three men in the fiery furnace appears as a magic fire ceremony by means of which the Son of God reveals himself. The Trinity is brought together with the unity, or, in other words, through coitus a child is produced. The glowing furnace (like the glowing tripod in \u201cFaust\u201d) is a mother symbol, where the children are produced.[329] The fourth in the fiery furnace appears as Christ, the Son of God, who has become a visible God in the fire. The mystic trinity and unity are sexual symbols. (Compare with that the many references in Inman: \u201cAncient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism.\u201d) It is said of the Saviour of Israel (the Messiah) and of his enemies, _Isaiah_ x:17:\u201cAnd the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a  flame.\u201dIn a hymn of the Syrian Ephrem it is said of Christ: \u201cThou who art all fire, have mercy upon me.\u201d",
