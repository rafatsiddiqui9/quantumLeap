    "paragraph": "It affords me especial satisfaction that our teacher also, when he laid his hand on the delicate material of the paranoic psychology, was forced to doubt the applicability of the conception of libido held by him at that time. The sexual definition of this did not permit me to understand those disturbances of function, which affect the vague territory of the hunger instinct just as much as that of the sexual instinct. For a long time the theory of libido seemed to me inapplicable to dementia pr\u00e6cox. With increasing experience in analytical work, however, I became aware of a gradual change in my conception of libido. In place of the descriptive definition of the \u201cThree Contributions\u201d there gradually grew up a generic definition of the libido, which rendered it possible for me to replace the expression \u201cpsychic energy\u201d by the term \u201clibido.\u201d I was forced to ask myself whether indeed the function of reality to-day does not consist only in its smaller part of libido sexualis and in the greater part of other impulses? It is still a very important question whether phylogenetically the function of reality is not, at least in great part, of sexual origin. To answer this question directly in regard to the function of reality is not possible, but we shall attempt to come to an understanding indirectly.\u201cWhat lies enclosed in the intellect, comes to development in the  world-soul as logos, fills it with meaning and makes it as if  intoxicated with nectar.\u201d[262]Nectar is analogous to soma, the drink of fertility and of life, also to sperma. The soul is fructified by the intellect; as oversoul it is called heavenly Aphrodite, as the undersoul the earthly Aphrodite. \u201cIt knows the birth pangs,\u201d[263] and so on. The bird of Aphrodite, the dove, is not without good cause the symbol of the Holy Ghost.",

    "question": "What analogies are made to describe the relationship between the intellect and the world-soul?",
    "answer": "The intellect is compared to nectar, which fills the world-soul with meaning and makes it feel intoxicated with nectar. Nectar is also likened to soma, the drink of fertility and life, and sperma, suggesting a connection to fertility and vitality. The soul, influenced by the intellect, is referred to as heavenly Aphrodite in its upper manifestation and earthly Aphrodite in its lower manifestation. The author notes that the soul experiences the birth pangs, which is a metaphor for its transformation and development.",
