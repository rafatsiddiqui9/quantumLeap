    "paragraph": "This symbolism is extremely significant, because it shows how easily a contrasting expression originates and how equally intelligible and characteristic such an expression is. The proud gesture with which the hero offers himself to death may very easily be an indirect expression which challenges the pity or sympathy of the other, and thus is doomed to the calm analytic reduction to which Brutus proceeds. The behavior of Chiwantopel is also suspicious, because the Cassius scene which serves as its model betrays indiscreetly that the whole affair is merely infantile and one which owes its origin to an overactive mother imago. When we compare this piece with the series of mother symbols brought to light in the previous chapter, we must say that the Cassius scene merely confirms once more what we have long supposed, that is to say, that the motor power of these symbolic visions arises from an infantile mother transference, that is to say, from an undetached bond to the mother.In the drama the libido, in contradistinction to the inactive nature of the previous symbols, assumes a threatening activity, a conflict becoming evident, in which the one part threatens the other with murder. The hero, as the ideal image of the dreamer, is inclined to die; he does not fear death. In accordance with the infantile character of this hero, it would most surely be time for him to take his departure from the stage, or, in childish language, to die. Death is to come to him in the form of an arrow-wound. Considering the fact that heroes themselves are very often great archers or succumb to an arrow-wound (St. Sebastian, as an example), it may not be superfluous to inquire into the meaning of death through an arrow.We read in the biography of the stigmatized nun Katherine Emmerich[599] the following description of the evidently neurotic sickness of her heart:",

    "question": "How does the hero's behavior reflect an infantile character, and what is the significance of the arrow-wound mentioned?",
    "answer": "The hero's behavior reflects an infantile character because he is depicted as dying, which is natural for a child and symbolizes the time when a child might be expected to leave the stage or \"die.\" The mention of an arrow-wound is significant because it aligns with the theme of heroes often being great archers or falling victim to arrow-wounds, such as St. Sebastian, indicating a deeper symbolic meaning related to these cultural references.",
