    "paragraph": "This activity comparison can belong equally well to the category of the analogous or to the category of the causative comparisons. _The possibilities of comparison mean just as many possibilities for symbolic expression_, and from this basis all the infinitely varied symbols, so far as they are libido images, may properly be reduced to a very simple root, that is, just to _libido and its fixed primitive qualities_. This psychologic reduction and simplification is in accordance with the historic efforts of civilization to unify and simplify, to syncretize, the endless number of the gods. We come across this desire as far back as the old Egyptians, where the unlimited polytheism as exemplified in the numerous demons of places finally necessitated simplification. All the various local gods, Amon of Thebes, Horus of Edfu, Horus of the East, Chnum of Elephantine, Atum of Heliopolis, and others,[143] became identified with the sun God R\u00ea. In the hymns to the sun the composite being Amon-R\u00ea-Harmachis-Atum was invoked as \u201cthe only god which truly lives.\u201d[144]Amenhotep IV (XVIII dynasty) went the furthest in this direction. He replaced all former gods by the \u201cliving great disc of the sun,\u201d the official title reading:\u201cThe sun ruling both horizons, triumphant in the horizon in his name;  the glittering splendor which is in the sun\u2019s disc.\u201d\u201cAnd, indeed,\u201d Erman adds,[145] \u201cthe sun, as a God, should not be honored, but the sun itself as a planet which imparts through its rays[146] the infinite life which is in it to all living creatures.\u201d",

    "question": "How does the author's discussion on psychologic reduction and simplification apply to the historical efforts of civilization?",
    "answer": "The author's discussion on psychologic reduction and simplification aligns with the historic efforts of civilization to unify and simplify various elements, such as the gods. This simplification is evident in the identification of multiple local gods in ancient Egypt, which eventually led to the synthesis of a single sun god, Amon-R\u00ea-Harmachis-Atum.",
