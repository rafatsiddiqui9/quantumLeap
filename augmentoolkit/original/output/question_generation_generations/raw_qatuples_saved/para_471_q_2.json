    "paragraph": "This condition to be sure is not a recognized or a conscious one, for the individual may think himself perfectly free from this past influence because he is living in the real world, and because actually there is a great difference between the present conditions and that of his childish past. He sees all this, intellectually, but there is a wide gap between the intellectual grasp of a situation and the emotional development, and it is the latter realm wherein lies the disharmony. However, although many ideas and feelings are connected with the parents, analysis reveals very often that they are only subjective and that in reality they bear little resemblance to the actual past situation. Therefore, Jung speaks no longer of the real father and mother but uses the term imago or image to represent the father or mother, because the feelings and phantasies frequently do not deal with the real parents but with the distorted and subjective image created by the imagination of the individual.Following this distinction Jung sees in the Oedipus complex of Freud only a symbol for the \u201cchildish desire towards the parents and for the conflict which this craving evokes,\u201d and cannot accept the theory that in this early stage of childhood the mother has any real sexual significance for the child.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between intellectual understanding and emotional development according to the text?",
    "answer": "According to the text, there is a significant gap between the intellectual grasp of a situation and the emotional development. Intellectual understanding may acknowledge differences between past and present conditions, but emotional development is a separate realm where underlying disharmony can exist. This gap suggests that emotional responses and feelings are not always aligned with intellectual comprehension.",
