I know not. Distance and nearness become blurred  into one; without and within glide into each other. Nearer and nearer,  _dearer and more homelike sounds the beating of the waves_; now, like  a thundering pulse in my head it strikes, and now it beats over my  soul, devours it, embraces it, while it itself at the same time floats  out like the blue waste of waters. Yes, without and within are one.  Glistening and foaming, flowing and fanning and roaring, the entire  symphony of the stimuli experienced sounds in one tone, all thought  becomes one thought, which becomes one with feeling; the world exhales  in the soul and the soul dissolves in the world. Our small life is  encircled by a great sleep\u2014_the sleep of our cradle, the sleep of our  grave, the sleep of our home, from which we go forth in the morning,  to which we again return in the evening_; our life but the short  journey, the interval between the emergence from the original oneness  and the sinking back into it! Blue shimmers the infinite sea, wherein  dreams the jelly fish of the primitive life, toward which without  ceasing our thoughts hark back dimly through eons of existence. For  every happening entails a change and a guarantee of the unity of life.  At that moment when they are no longer blended together, in that  instant man lifts his _head, blind and dripping, from the depths_ of  the stream of experience, from the oneness with the experience; at  that moment of parting when the unity of life in startled surprise  detaches the Change and holds it away from itself as something alien,  at this moment of alienation the aspects of the experience have been  substantialized into subject and object, and in that moment ",

    "question": "How does the author describe the sensation of lying on the seashore and the experience of the waves?",
    "answer": "The author describes lying on the seashore with the shining waters glittering in their dreamy eyes. The soft breeze flutters at a great distance, and the waves' beat is throbbing, shimmering, stirring, and lulling to sleep. The sound of the waves grows closer, becoming dearer and more homelike, and can be heard both in the head and over the soul. The waves seem to float out like the blue sea, blurring the distinction between what is without and within.",
