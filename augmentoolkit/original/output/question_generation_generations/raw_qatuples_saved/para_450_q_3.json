    "paragraph": "At that time we had placed sun and fire in parentheses. Now they are entitled to their right place in the chain of synonyms. With the changing of the erotic impression from the affirmative to the negative the symbols of light occur as the paramount object. In the second poem where the longing is clearly exposed it is by no means the terrestrial sun. Since the longing has been turned away from the real object, its object has become, first of all, a subjective one, namely, God. Psychologically, however, God is the name of a representation-complex which is grouped around a strong feeling (the sum of libido). Properly, the feeling is what gives character and reality to the complex.[117] _The attributes and symbols of the divinity must belong in a consistent manner to the feeling_ (_longing, love, libido, and so on_). If one honors God, the sun or the fire, then one honors one\u2019s own vital force, the libido. It is as Seneca says: \u201cGod is near you, he is with you, in you.\u201d God is our own longing to which we pay divine honors.[118] If it were not known how tremendously significant religion was, and is, this marvellous play with one\u2019s self would appear absurd. There must be something more than this, however, because, notwithstanding its absurdity, it is, in a certain sense, conformable to the purpose in the highest degree.

To bear a God within one\u2019s self signifies just as much as to be God one\u2019s self. In Christianity, where, it is true, the grossly sensual representations and symbols are weeded out as carefully as possible, which seems to be a continuation of the poverty of symbols of the Jewish cult, there are to be found plain traces of this psychology.

    "question": "How does the text view the significance of religion in this context?",
    "answer": "The text views religion as having tremendous significance. The play of self-honoring, where individuals honor God, the sun, or fire, is described as absurd but conformable to a higher purpose. Religion provides a sense of inner strength and happiness, and the act of bearing a God within oneself is seen as a guarantee of power and even omnipotence. This psychological significance of religion is highlighted as a profound element of human experience.",
