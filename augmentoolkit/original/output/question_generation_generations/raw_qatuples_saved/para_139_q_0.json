    "paragraph": "The infantile scene cannot carry through its revival; it must be satisfied with its return as a dream. From this conception of the historical side of regression, it follows consequently that the modes of conclusion of the dream, in so far as one may speak of them, must show at the same time an analogous and infantile character. This is truly the case, as experience has abundantly shown, so that to-day every one who is familiar with the subject of dream analysis confirms Freud\u2019s proposition that _dreams are a piece of the conquered life of the childish soul_. Inasmuch as the childish psychic life is undeniably of an archaic type, this characteristic belongs to the dream in quite an unusual degree. Freud calls our attention to this especially.\u201cThe dream, which fulfils its wishes by a short, regressive path,  affords us only an example of the primary method of working of the  psychic apparatus, which has been abandoned by us as unsuitable. That  which once ruled in the waking state, when the psychical life was  still young and impotent, appears to be banished to the dream life, in  somewhat the same way as the bow and arrow, those discarded, primitive  weapons of adult humanity, have been relegated to the nursery.\u201d[32]",

    "question": "What does the author suggest is the nature of the infantile scene in dreams?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the infantile scene in dreams cannot fully return to its original form, but instead returns as a dream. This implies that the infantile elements in dreams are symbolic and represent a return to an earlier, more childish state.",
