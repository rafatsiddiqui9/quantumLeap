    "paragraph": "A six-year-old girl, who goes to school unwillingly, dreams that her leg is encircled by a large red worm. She had a tender interest for this creature, contrary to what might be expected. An adult patient, who cannot separate from an older friend on account of an extraordinarily strong mother transference, dreams that \u201cshe had to get across some deep water (typical idea!) with this friend; her friend fell in (mother transference); she tries to drag her out, and almost succeeds, but a large crab seizes on the dreamer by the foot and tries to pull her in.\u201d",

    "question": "What might the large crab in the dream of the adult patient symbolize in relation to their relationship with their older friend and the strong mother transference?",
    "answer": "The large crab in the dream could symbolize an external force or an anxiety that is threatening the patient's emotional security and the balance in their relationship with the older friend. The crab grabbing the patient's foot might represent the patient's fear of being pulled into a situation they cannot control, possibly related to the strong mother transference and the sense of being overwhelmed by the older friend's presence.",
