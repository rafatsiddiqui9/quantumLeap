    "paragraph": "[469] In honor of this the Pamylion were celebrated. They were similar to the phallophorion. Pamyles is a phallic demon, similar to the original Dionysus. The myth reduced reads: Osiris and Isis were generated by phallus from the water (mother womb) in the ordinary manner. (Kronos had made Rhea pregnant, the relation was secret, and Rhea was his sister. Helios, however, observed it and cursed the relation.) Osiris was killed in a crafty manner by the god of the underworld, Typhon, who locked him in a chest. He was thrown into the Nile, and so carried out to sea. Osiris, however, mated in the underworld with his second sister, Nephthys (motive of the night journey to the sea with incest). One sees here how the symbolism is developed. In the mother womb, before the outward existence, Osiris commits incest; in death, the second intrauterine existence, Osiris again commits incest. Both times with a sister who is simply substituted for the mother as a legal, uncensured symbol, since the marriage with a sister in early antiquity was not merely tolerated, but was really commended. Zarathustra also recommended the marriage of kindred. This form of myth would be impossible to-day, because cohabitation with the sister, being incestuous, would be repressed. The wicked Typhon entices Osiris craftily into a box or chest; this distortion of the true state of affairs is transparent. The \u201coriginal sin\u201d caused men to wish to go back into the mother again, that is, the incestuous desire for the mother, condemned by law, is the ruse supposedly invented by Typhon. The fact is, the ruse is very significant. Man tries to sneak into rebirth through subterfuge in order to become a child again. An early Egyptian hymn[470] even raises an accusation against the mother Isis because she destroys the sun-god R\u00ea by treachery. It was interpreted as the ill-will of the mother towards her son that she banished and betrayed him.",

    "question": "What is the myth of Osiris and Isis, and how does it reflect the symbolism described in the text?\n\n**ANS:** \nThe myth of Osiris and Isis describes how Osiris, a pharaoh and god, was born from a phallus that emerged from the waters, symbolizing the idea of birth and the origins of life. Osiris was later killed by Typhon, the god of the underworld, and his body was thrown into the Nile. This myth reflects the symbolism of Osiris's life and death, with incestuous themes representing the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. His second sister, Nephthys, symbolizes the second intrauterine existence where he again commits incest, further illustrating the themes of repeated cycles and the symbolic nature of incestuous relationships.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the text explain the symbolism of incest in the myth of Osiris and Isis, and what does it suggest about human desires?",
    "answer": "The text explains that the incestuous themes in the myth of Osiris and Isis symbolize the human desire to return to a state of innocence or purity, as reflected in the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. The incestuous relationships, particularly with sisters, are seen as legal and uncensored symbols in early antiquity, representing a desire to reconnect with the mother, which was symbolically thwarted by Typhon's trick. This suggests that humans, despite societal laws, have a deep-seated wish to go back to an idealized state of innocence, often through forbidden means.",
