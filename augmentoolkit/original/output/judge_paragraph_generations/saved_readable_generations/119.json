{"paragraph": "Miss Miller neglects to tell which passages in Job occurred to her mind. These, unfortunately, are therefore only general suppositions. Take first, the analogy to the Lost Paradise. Job lost all that he had, and this was due to an act of Satan, who wished to incite him against God. In the same way mankind, through the temptation of the serpent, lost Paradise, and was plunged into earth\u2019s torments. The idea, or rather the mood which is expressed by the reference to the Lost Paradise, is Miss Miller\u2019s feeling that she had lost something which was connected with satanic temptation. To her it happened, just as to Job, that she suffered innocently, for she did not fall a victim to temptation. Job\u2019s sufferings are not understood by his friends;[69] no one knows that Satan has taken a hand in the game, and that Job is truly innocent. Job never tires of avowing his innocence. Is there a hint in that? We know that certain neurotic and especially mentally diseased people continually defend their innocence against non-existent attacks; however, one discovers at a closer examination that the patient, while he apparently defends his innocence without reason, fulfils with that a \u201cDeckhandlung,\u201d the energy for which arises from just those impulses, whose sinful character is revealed by the contents of the pretended reproach and calumny.[70]Job suffered doubly, on one side through the loss of his fortune, on the other through the lack of understanding in his friends; the latter can be seen throughout the book. The suffering of the misunderstood recalls the figure of Cyrano de Bergerac\u2014he too suffered doubly, on one side through hopeless love, on the other side through misunderstanding. He falls, as we have seen, in the last hopeless battle against \u201cLe Mensonge, les Compromis, les Pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, les L\u00e2chet\u00e9s et la Sottise.\u2014Oui, Vous m\u2019arrachez tout le laurier et la rose!\u201dJob laments", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
