{"paragraph": "\u201cBehold now behemoth, which I made as well as thee;    He eateth grass as an ox.    Lo, now; his strength is in his loins,    And his force is in the muscles of his belly.    He moveth his tail like a cedar:    The sinews of his thighs are knit together.    His bones are as tubes of brass;    His limbs are like bars of iron.    He is the chief of the ways of God:    He only that made him giveth him his sword....    Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;    He is confident though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.    Shall any take him when he is on the watch.    Or pierce through his nose with a snare?    Canst thou draw leviathan with a fish-hook?    Or press down his tongue with a cord?...    Lay thy hand upon him;    Remember the battle and do no more.    None is so fierce that dare stir him up:    Who then is he that can stand before me?    Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?    Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.\u201d             \u2014_Job_ xl: 15\u201320, 23\u201324; xli: 1, 8, 10\u201311.God says this in order to bring his power and omnipotence impressively before Job\u2019s eyes. God is like the behemoth and the leviathan; the fruitful nature giving forth abundance,\u2014the untamable wildness and boundlessness of nature,\u2014and the overwhelming danger of the unchained power.[80]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
