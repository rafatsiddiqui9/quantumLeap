    "paragraph": "Man leaves the mother, the source of libido, and is driven by the eternal thirst to find her again, and to drink renewal from her; thus he completes his cycle, and returns again into the mother\u2019s womb. Every obstacle which obstructs his life\u2019s path, and threatens his ascent, wears the shadowy features of the \u201cterrible mother,\u201d who paralyzes his energy with the consuming poison of the stealthy, retrospective longing. In each conquest he wins again the smiling love and life-giving mother\u2014images which belong to the intuitive depths of human feeling, the features of which have become mutilated and irrecognizable through the progressive development of the surface of the human mind. The stern necessity of adaptation works ceaselessly to obliterate the last traces of these primitive landmarks of the period of the origin of the human mind, and to replace them along lines which are to denote more and more clearly the nature of real objects.CHAPTER VIII               THE SACRIFICEAfter this long digression, let us return to Miss Miller\u2019s vision. We can now answer the question as to the significance of Siegfried\u2019s longing for Brunhilde. It is the striving of the libido away _from the mother towards the mother_. This paradoxical sentence may be translated as follows: as long as the libido is satisfied merely with phantasies, it moves in itself, in its own depths, in the mother.[789] When the longing of our author rises in order to escape the magic circle of the incestuous and, therefore, pernicious, object, and it does not succeed in finding reality, then the object is and remains irrevocably the mother. Only the overcoming of the obstacles of reality brings the deliverance from the mother, who is the continuous and inexhaustible source of life for the creator, but death for the cowardly, timid and sluggish.",

    "question": "How does the passage explain the process of overcoming obstacles in life?",
    "answer": "The passage explains that overcoming obstacles in life brings deliverance from the \"mother\" figure. The mother, being the source of life for the creator but death for the timid, can only be transcended by successfully navigating and surmounting the real-world challenges, which provide the deliverance needed to move beyond the insatiable demands of the mother\u2019s influence.",
