    "paragraph": "One principal question arises at the sight of this beauty and greatness of feeling, that is, whether the primary tendency compensated by religion is not too narrowly understood as incestuous. I have previously observed in regard to this that I consider the \u201cresistance opposed to libido\u201d as in a general way coincident with the incest prohibition. I must leave open for the present the definition of the psychological incest conception. However, I will here emphasize the point that it is most especially the totality of the sun myth which proves to us that the fundamental basis of the \u201cincestuous\u201d desire does not aim at cohabitation, but at the special thought of becoming a child again, of turning back to the parent\u2019s protection, of coming into the mother once more in order to be born again. But incest stands in the path to this goal, that is to say, the necessity of in some way again gaining entrance into the mother\u2019s womb. One of the simplest ways would be to impregnate the mother, and to reproduce one\u2019s self identically. But here the incest prohibition interferes; therefore, the myths of the sun or of rebirth teem with all possible proposals as to how incest can be evaded. A very simple method of avoidance is to transform the mother into another being or to rejuvenate[453] her after birth has occurred, to have her disappear again or have her change back. It is not incestuous cohabitation which is desired, but the rebirth, which now is attained most readily through cohabitation. But this is not the only way, although perhaps the original one. The resistance to the incest prohibition makes the phantasy inventive; for example, it was attempted to impregnate the mother by means of a magic charm of fertility (to wish for a child). Attempts in this respect remain in the stage of mythical phantasies; but they have one result, and that is the exercise of the phantasy which gradually produces paths through the creation of ",

    "question": "What role does the incest prohibition play in sun myths or myths of rebirth, according to the author?",
    "answer": "The incest prohibition plays a significant role in sun myths or myths of rebirth by standing in the way of achieving the goal of rebirth through cohabitation. It necessitates finding alternative ways to regain entrance into the mother\u2019s womb, such as transforming the mother into another being or rejuvenating her after birth.",
