The Discovery of the Truth

As Oedipus grew up, he encountered various challenges and obstacles. He eventually became the king of Thebes and married Jocasta, unaware of his true parentage. The truth about his past was eventually revealed when a plague struck Thebes, and Oedipus consulted the oracle at Delphi. The oracle told him that the plague would end when the murderer of Laius was found and punished.
