    "paragraph": "\u201cThe features, which, especially in the upper portion, bear an  absolutely ideal character, have an extremely morbid expression.\u201dCumont[835] himself says of the facial expression of the Tauroctonos:\u201cThe countenance, which may be seen in the best reproductions, is that  of a young man of an almost feminine beauty; the head has a quantity  of curly hair, which, rising up from the forehead, surrounds him as  with a halo; the head is slightly tilted backwards, so that the glance  is directed towards the heavens, and the contraction of the brows and  the lips give a strange expression of sorrow to the face.\u201d[836]The Ostian head of Mithra Tauroctonos, illustrated in Cumont, has, indeed, an expression which we recognize in our patients as one of sentimental resignation. _Sentimentality is repressed brutality._ Hence the exceedingly sentimental pose, which had its counterpart in the symbolism of the shepherd and the lamb of contemporaneous Christianity, with the addition of infantilism.[837]Meanwhile, it is only his animal nature which the god sacrifices; that is to say, his sexuality,[838] always in close analogy to the course of the sun. We have learned in the course of this investigation that the part of the libido which erects religious structures is in the last analysis fixed in the mother, and really represents that tie through which we are permanently connected with our origin. Briefly, we may designate this amount of libido as \u201cMother Libido.\u201d As we have seen, this libido conceals itself in countless and very heterogeneous symbols, also in animal images, no matter whether of masculine or feminine nature\u2014differences of sex are at bottom of a secondary value and psychologically do not play the part which might be expected from a superficial observation.",

    "question": "According to the description, how is the facial expression of the Tauroctonos depicted, and what does this expression suggest?",
    "answer": "The facial expression of the Tauroctonos is described as having an extremely morbid and almost feminine beauty. The head has curly hair that surrounds the head like a halo, and the head is slightly tilted back, with a gaze directed towards the heavens. The contraction of the brows and lips gives the face a strange expression of sorrow, suggesting a deeply emotional and sorrowful state.",
