This ceremonial or magic repetition of this very\nancient, long-outlived observance shows how insistently the human mind\nclings to the old forms, and how deeply rooted is this very ancient\nreminiscence of fire boring. One might almost be inclined to see in the\nsexual symbolism of fire production a relatively late addition to the\npriestly lore. This may, indeed, be true for the ceremonial elaboration\nof the fire mysteries, but whether originally the generation of fire was\nin general a sexual action, that is to say, a “coitus-play,” is still a\nquestion. That similar things occur among very primitive people we learn\nfrom the Australian tribe of the Watschandies,[302] who in the spring\nperform the following magic ceremonies of fertilization: They dig a hole\nin the ground, so formed and surrounded with bushes as to counterfeit a\nwoman’s genitals. They dance the night long around this hole; in\nconnection with this they hold spears in front of themselves in a manner\nto recall the penis in erection. They dance around the hole and thrust\ntheir spears into the ditch, while they cry to it, “Pulli nira, pulli\nnira, _wataka_!” (Non fossa, non fossa, sed cunnus!) Such obscene dances\nappear among other primitive races as well.[303]\n\nIn this spring incantation are contained the elements of the coitus\nplay.[304] This play is nothing but a coitus game, that is to say,\noriginally this play was simply a coitus in the form of sacramental\nmating, which for a long time was a mysterious element among certain\ncults, and reappeared in sects.[305] In the ceremonies of Zinzendorf’s\nfollowers echoes of the coitus sacrament may be recognized; also in\nother sects.\n\nOne can easily think that just as the above-mentioned Australian bushmen\nperform the coitus play in this manner the same performance could be\nenacted in another manner, and, indeed, in the form of fire production.\nInstead of through two selected human beings, the coitus was represented\nby two substitutes, by Purûravas and Urvaçi, by Phallus and Vulva, by\nborer and opening. Just as the primitive thought behind other customs is\nreally the sacramental coition so here the primal tendency is really the\nact itself. For the act of fertilization is the climax—the true festival\nof life, and well worthy to become the nucleus of a religious mystery.\nIf we are justified in concluding that the symbolism of the hole in the\nearth used by the Watschandies for the fertilization of the earth takes\nthe place of the coitus, then the generation of fire could be considered\nin the same way as a substitute for coitus; and, indeed, it might be\nfurther concluded as a consequence of this reasoning that the invention\nof fire-making is also due to the need of supplying a symbol for the\nsexual act.[306]\n\nLet us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom of boring. Let us\nimagine a strong adult man carrying on the boring with two pieces of\nwood with the same perseverance and the energy corresponding to that of\nthis child. He may very easily create fire by this play. But of greatest\nsignificance in this work is the rhythm.[307] This hypothesis seems to\nme psychologically possible, although it should not be said with this\nthat only in this way could the discovery of fire occur. It can result\njust as well by the striking together of flints. It is scarcely possible\nthat fire was created in only one way. All I want to establish here is\nmerely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications of which point\nto the possibility that in such a way was fire invented or prepared.\n\nThe existence of the primitive coitus play or rite seems to me\nsufficiently proven. The only thing that is obscure is the energy and\nemphasis of the ritual play. It is well known that those primitive rites\nwere often of very bloody seriousness, and were performed with an\nextraordinary display of energy, which appears as a great contrast to\nthe well-known indolence of primitive humanity. Therefore, the ritual\nactivity entirely loses the character of play, and wins that of\npurposeful effort. If certain Negro races can dance the whole night long\nto three tones in the most monotonous manner, then, according to our\nidea, there is in this an absolute lack of the character of play\npastime; it approaches nearer to exercise. There seems to exist a sort\nof compulsion to transfer the libido into such ritual activity. If the\nbasis of the ritual activity is the sexual act, we may assume that it is\nreally the underlying thought and object of the exercise. Under these\ncircumstances, the question arises why the primitive man endeavors to\nrepresent the sexual act symbolically and with effort, or, if this\nwording appears to be too hypothetical, why does he exert energy to such\na degree only to accomplish practically useless things, which apparently\ndo not especially amuse him?[308] It may be assumed that the sexual act\nis more desirable to primitive man than such absurd and, moreover,\nfatiguing exercises. It is hardly possible but that a certain compulsion\nconducts the energy away from the original object and real purpose,\ninducing the production of surrogates. The existence of a phallic or\norgiastic cult does not indicate _eo ipso_ a particularly lascivious\nlife any more than the ascetic symbolism of Christianity means an\nespecially moral life. One honors that which one does not possess or\nthat which one is not. This compulsion, to speak in the nomenclature\nformulated above, removes a certain amount of libido from the real\nsexual activity, and creates a symbolic and practically valid substitute\nfor what is lost. This psychology is confirmed by the above-mentioned\nWatschandie ceremony; during the entire ceremony none of the men may\nlook at a woman. This detail again informs us from whence the libido is\nto be diverted. But this gives rise to the pressing question, Whence\ncomes this compulsion? We have already suggested above that the\nprimitive sexuality encounters a resistance which leads to a\nside-tracking of the libido on to substitution actions (analogy,\nsymbolism, etc.). It is unthinkable that it is a question of any outer\nopposition whatsoever, or of a real obstacle, since it occurs to no\nsavage to catch his elusive quarry with ritual charms; but it is a\nquestion of an internal resistance; will opposes will; libido opposes\nlibido, since a psychologic resistance as an energic phenomenon\ncorresponds to a certain amount of libido. The psychologic compulsion\nfor the transformation of the libido is based on an original division of\nthe will. I will return to this primal splitting of the libido in\nanother place. Here let us concern ourselves only with the problem of\nthe transition of the libido. The transition takes place, as has been\nrepeatedly suggested by means of shifting to an analogy. The libido is\ntaken away from its proper place and transferred to another substratum.\n\nThe resistance against sexuality aims, therefore, at preventing the\nsexual act; it also seeks to crowd the libido away from the sexual\nfunction. We see, for example, in hysteria, how the specific repression\nblocks the real path of transference; therefore, the libido is obliged\nto take another path, and that an earlier one, namely, the incestuous\nroad which ultimately leads to the parents. Let us speak, however, of\nthe incest prohibition, which hindered the very first sexual\ntransference. Then the situation changes in so far that no earlier way\nof transference is left, except that of the presexual stage of\ndevelopment, where the libido was still partly in the function of\nnutrition. By a regression to the presexual material the libido becomes\nquasi-desexualized. But as the incest prohibition signifies only a\ntemporary and conditional restriction of the sexuality, thus only that\npart of the libido which is best designated as the incestuous component\nis now pushed back to the presexual stage. The repression, therefore,\nconcerns only that part of the sexual libido which wishes to fix itself\npermanently upon the parents. The sexual libido is only withdrawn from\nthe incestuous component, repressed upon the presexual stage, and there,\nif the operation is successful, desexualized, by which this amount of\nlibido is prepared for an asexual application. However, it is to be\nassumed that this operation is accomplished only with difficulty,\nbecause the incestuous libido, so to speak, must be artificially\nseparated from the sexual libido, with which, for ages, through the\nwhole animal kingdom, it was indistinguishably united. The regression of\nthe incestuous component must, therefore, take place, not only with\ngreat difficulty, but also carry with it into the presexual stage a\nconsiderable sexual character. The consequence of this is that the\nresulting phenomena, although stamped with the character of the sexual\nact, are, nevertheless, not really sexual acts _de facto_; they are\nderived from the presexual stage, and are maintained by the repressed\nsexual libido, therefore possess a double significance. Thus the fire\nboring is a coitus (and, to be sure, an incestuous one), but a\ndesexualized one, which has lost its immediate sexual worth, and is,\ntherefore, indirectly useful to the propagation of the species. The\npresexual stage is characterized by countless possibilities of\napplication, because the libido has not yet formed definite\nlocalizations. It therefore appears intelligible that an amount of\nlibido which reaches this stage through regression is confronted with\nmanifold possibilities of application. Above all, it is met with the\npossibility of a purely onanistic activity. But as the matter in\nquestion in the regressive component of libido is sexual libido, the\nultimate object of which is propagation, therefore it goes to the\nexternal object (Parents); it will also introvert with this destination\nas its essential character. The result, therefore, is that the purely\nonanistic activity turns out to be insufficient, and another object must\nbe sought for, which takes the place of the incest object. The nurturing\nmother earth represents the ideal example of such an object. The\npsychology of the presexual stage contributes the nutrition component;\nthe sexual libido the coitus idea. From this the ancient symbols of\nagriculture arise. In the work of agriculture hunger and incest\nintermingle. The ancient cults of mother earth and all the superstitions\nfounded thereon saw in the cultivation of the earth the fertilization of\nthe mother. The aim of the action is desexualized, however, for it is\nthe fruit of the field and the nourishment contained therein. The\nregression resulting from the incest prohibition leads, in this case, to\nthe new valuation of the mother; this time, however, not as a sexual\nobject, but as a nourisher.\n\nThe discovery of fire seems to be due to a very similar regression to\nthe presexual stage, more particularly to the nearest stage of the\ndisplaced rhythmic manifestation. The libido, introverted from the\nincest prohibition (with the more detailed designation of the motor\ncomponents of coitus), when it reaches the presexual stage, meets the\nrelated infantile boring, to which it now gives, in accordance with its\nrealistic destination, an actual material. (Therefore the material is\nfittingly called “materia,” as the object is the mother as above.) As I\nsought to show above, the action of the infantile boring requires only\nthe strength and perseverance of an adult man and suitable “material” in\norder to generate fire. If this is so, it may be expected that analogous\nto our foregoing case of onanistic boring the generation of fire\noriginally occurred as such an act of quasi-onanistic activity,\nobjectively expressed. The demonstration of this can never be actually\nfurnished, but it is thinkable that somewhere traces of this original\nonanistic preliminary exercise of fire production have been preserved. I\nhave succeeded in finding a passage in a very old monument of Hindoo\nliterature which contains this transition of the sexual libido through\nthe onanistic phase in the preparation of fire. This passage is found in\nBrihadâranyaka-Upanishad:[309]",
