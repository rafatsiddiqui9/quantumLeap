- content: 'Text: """In this conception of Jung will be seen an analogy to Bergson,
    who speaks of “this change, this movement and becoming, this self-creation, call
    it what you will, as the very stuff and reality of our being.”[2]In developing
    the energic conception of libido and separating it from Freud’s sexual definition,
    Jung makes possible the explanation of interest in general, and provides a working
    concept by which not only the specifically sexual, but the general activities
    and reactions of man can be understood.If a person complains of no longer having
    interest in his work or of losing interest in his surroundings, then one understands
    that his libido is withdrawn from this object and that in consequence the object
    itself seems no longer attractive, whereas, as a matter of fact, the object itself
    is exactly the same as formerly. In other words, it is the libido that we bestow
    upon an object that makes it attractive and interesting.The causes for the withdrawal
    of libido may be various and are usually quite different from those that the persons
    offer in explanation. It is the task of psychoanalysis to discover the real reasons,
    which are usually hidden and unknown. On the other hand, when an individual exhibits
    an exaggerated interest or places an over-emphasis upon an idea or situation,
    then we know there is too much libido here and that we may find as a consequence
    a corresponding depletion elsewhere.This leads directly into the second point
    of difference between Jung’s views and those of Freud. This is concerned with
    those practically universal childish manifestations of sexuality called by Freud
    “polymorphous perverse” because of their similarity to those abnormalities of
    sexuality which occur in adults and are called perversions."""

    Freud''s, and what does this allow for in psychological understanding?"""


    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): """Jung''s
    conception of libido separates it from Freud''s sexual definition, allowing for
