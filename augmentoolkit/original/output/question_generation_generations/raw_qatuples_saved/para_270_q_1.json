    "paragraph": "of the preparation of fire, it is no longer difficult to guess what is the forbidden thing; _it is onanism_. When I stated before that it might be lack of satisfaction which breaks up the autoerotic ring of the displaced sexual activity transferred to the body itself, and thus opens wider fields of culture, I did not mention that this loosely closed ring of the displaced onanistic activity could be much more firmly closed, when man makes the other great discovery, that of true onanism.[337] With that the activity is started in the proper place, and this, under certain circumstances, may mean a satisfaction sufficient for a long time, but at the expense of cheating sexuality of its real purpose. It is a fraud upon the natural development of things, because all the dynamic forces which can and should serve the development of culture are withdrawn from it through onanism, since, instead of the displacement, a regression to the local sexual takes place, which is precisely the opposite of that which is desirable. Psychologically, however, onanism is a discovery of a significance not to be undervalued. One is protected from fate, since no sexual need then has the power to give one up to life. For with onanism one has the greatest magic in one\u2019s hands; one needs only to phantasy, and with that to masturbate, then one possesses all the pleasure of the world, and is no longer compelled to conquer the world of one\u2019s desires through hard labor and wrestling with reality.[338] Aladdin rubs his lamp and the obedient genii stand at his bidding; thus the fairy tale expresses the great psychologic advantage of the easy regression to the local sexual satisfaction. Aladdin\u2019s symbol subtly confirms the ambiguity of the magic fire preparation.",

    "answer": "The author suggests that onanism can make the loosely closed ring of displaced onanistic activity much more firmly closed. When true onanism is discovered, the activity is started in the proper place, potentially providing sufficient satisfaction for a long time, but at the expense of cheating sexuality of its real purpose.",
