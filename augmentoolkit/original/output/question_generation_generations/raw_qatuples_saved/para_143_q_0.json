    "paragraph": "The battle with the night serpent signifies, therefore, the conquering of the mother, who is suspected of an infamous crime, that is, the betrayal of the son. A full confirmation of the connection comes to us through the fragment of the Babylonian epic of the creation, discovered by George Smith, mostly from the library of Asurbanipal. The period of the origin of the text was probably in the time of Hammurabi (2,000 B.C.). We learn from this account of creation[528] that the sun-god Ea, the son of the depths of the waters and the god of wisdom,[529] had conquered Aps\u00fb. Aps\u00fb is the creator of the great gods (he existed in the beginning in a sort of trinity with Ti\u00e2mat\u2014the mother of gods and Mumu, his vizier). Ea conquered the father, but Ti\u00e2mat plotted revenge. She prepared herself for battle against the gods.\u201cMother Hubur, who created everything,   Procured invincible weapons, gave birth to giant snakes   With pointed teeth, relentless in every way;   Filled their bellies with poison instead of blood,   Furious gigantic lizards, clothed them with horrors,   Let them swell with the splendor of horror, formed them rearing,   Whoever sees them shall die of terror.   Their bodies shall rear without turning to escape.   She arrayed the lizards, dragons and La\u1e2bamen,   Hurricanes, mad dogs, scorpion men,   Mighty storms, fishmen and rams.   With relentless weapons, without fear of conflict,   Powerful are Ti\u00e2mat\u2019s commands, irresistible are they.",
