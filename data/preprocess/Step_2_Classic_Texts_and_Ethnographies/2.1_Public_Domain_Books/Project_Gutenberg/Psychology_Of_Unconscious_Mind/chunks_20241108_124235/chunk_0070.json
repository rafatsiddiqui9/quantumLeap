According to\nMînôkhired, Gayomard had destroyed the Dév Azûr, who was considered the\ndemon of evil appetites.[831] In spite of the efforts of Zarathustra,\nthis demon remained longest on the earth. He was destroyed at last at\nthe resurrection, like Satan in the Apocalypse of John. In another\nversion it is said that Angromainyus and the serpent were left until the\nlast, so as to be destroyed by Ahuramazda himself. According to a\nsurmise by Kern, Zarathustra may mean “golden-star” and be identical\nwith Mithra. Mithra’s name is connected with neo-Persian _Mihr_, which\nmeans “sun and love.”\n\nIn Zagreus we see that the bull is also identical with the god; hence\nthe bull sacrifice is a god sacrifice, but on a primitive stage. The\nanimal symbol is, so to speak, only a part of the hero; he sacrifices\nonly his animal; therefore, symbolically, renounces only his animal\nnature. The internal participation in the sacrifice[832] is expressed\nexcellently in the anguished ecstatic countenance of the bull-slaying\nMithra. He does it willingly and unwillingly[833] hence the somewhat\nhysterical expression which has some similarity to the well-known\nmawkish countenance of the Crucified of Guido Reni. Benndorf says:[834]\n\n  “The features, which, especially in the upper portion, bear an\n  absolutely ideal character, have an extremely morbid expression.”\n\nCumont[835] himself says of the facial expression of the Tauroctonos:\n\n  “The countenance, which may be seen in the best reproductions, is that\n  of a young man of an almost feminine beauty; the head has a quantity\n  of curly hair, which, rising up from the forehead, surrounds him as\n  with a halo; the head is slightly tilted backwards, so that the glance\n  is directed towards the heavens, and the contraction of the brows and\n  the lips give a strange expression of sorrow to the face.”[836]\n\nThe Ostian head of Mithra Tauroctonos, illustrated in Cumont, has,\nindeed, an expression which we recognize in our patients as one of\nsentimental resignation. _Sentimentality is repressed brutality._ Hence\nthe exceedingly sentimental pose, which had its counterpart in the\nsymbolism of the shepherd and the lamb of contemporaneous Christianity,\nwith the addition of infantilism.[837]\n\nMeanwhile, it is only his animal nature which the god sacrifices; that\nis to say, his sexuality,[838] always in close analogy to the course of\nthe sun. We have learned in the course of this investigation that the\npart of the libido which erects religious structures is in the last\nanalysis fixed in the mother, and really represents that tie through\nwhich we are permanently connected with our origin. Briefly, we may\ndesignate this amount of libido as “Mother Libido.” As we have seen,\nthis libido conceals itself in countless and very heterogeneous symbols,\nalso in animal images, no matter whether of masculine or feminine\nnature—differences of sex are at bottom of a secondary value and\npsychologically do not play the part which might be expected from a\nsuperficial observation.\n\nThe annual sacrifice of the maiden to the dragon probably represented\nthe most ideal symbolic situation. In order to pacify the anger of the\n“terrible mother” the most beautiful woman was sacrificed as symbol of\nman’s libido. Less vivid examples are the sacrifice of the first-born\nand various valuable domestic animals. A second ideal case is the\nself-castration in the service of the mother (Dea Syria, etc.), a less\nobvious form of which is circumcision. By that at least only a portion\nis sacrificed.[839] With these sacrifices, the object of which in ideal\ncases is to symbolize the libido drawing away from the mother, life is\nsymbolically renounced in order to regain it. By the sacrifice man\nransoms himself from the fear of death and reconciles the destroying\nmother. In those later religions, where the hero, who in olden times\novercomes all evil and death through his labors, has become the divine\nchief figure, he becomes the priestly sacrificer and the regenerator of\nlife. But as the hero is an imaginary figure and his sacrifice is a\ntranscendental mystery, the significance of which far exceeds the value\nof an ordinary sacrificial gift, this deepening of the sacrificial\nsymbolism regressively resumes the idea of the human sacrifice. This is\npartly due to the preponderance of phantastic additions, which always\ntake their subject-matter from greater depths, and partly due to the\nhigher religious occupation of the libido, which demanded a more\ncomplete and equivalent expression. Thus the relation between Mithra and\nhis bull is very close. It is the hero himself in the Christian\nmysteries who sacrifices himself voluntarily. The hero, as we have\nsufficiently shown, is the infantile personality longing for the mother,\nwho as Mithra sacrifices the wish (the libido), and as Christ gives\nhimself to death both willingly and unwillingly. Upon the monuments of\nthe Mithraic religion we often meet a strange symbol: a crater (mixing\nbowl) encoiled by a serpent, sometimes with a lion, who as antagonist\nopposes the serpent.[840] It appears as if the two were fighting for the\ncrater. The crater symbolizes, as we have seen, the mother, the serpent\nthe resistance defending her, and the lion the greatest strength and\nstrongest will.[841] The struggle is for the mother. The serpent takes\npart almost regularly in the Mithraic sacrifice of the bull, moving\ntowards the blood flowing from the wound. It seems to follow from that\nthat the life of the bull (blood) is sacrificed to the serpent.\nPreviously we have pointed out the mutual relationship between serpent\nand bull, and found there that the bull symbolizes the living hero, the\nshining sun, but that the serpent symbolizes the dead, buried or\nchthonic hero, the invisible sun. As the hero is in the mother in the\nstate of death, the serpent is also, as the symbol of the fear of death,\nthe sign of the devouring mother. The sacrifice of the bull to the\nserpent, therefore, signifies a willing renunciation of life, in order\nto win it from death. Therefore, after the sacrifice of the bull,\nwonderful fertility results. The antagonism between serpent and lion\nover the crater is to be interpreted as a battle over the fruitful\nmother’s womb, somewhat comparable to the more simple symbolism of the\nTishtriya song, where the demon Apaosha, the black horse, has possession\nof the rain lake, and the white horse, Tishtriya, must banish him from\nit. Death from time to time lays its destroying hand upon life and\nfertility and the libido disappears, by entering into the mother, from\nwhose womb it will be born renewed. It, therefore, seems very probable\nthat the significance of the Mithraic bull sacrifice is also that of the\nsacrifice of the mother who sends the fear of death. As the contrary of\nthe Occide moriturus is also intended here, so is the act of sacrifice\nan impregnating of the mother; the chthonic snake demon drinks the\nblood; that is to say, the libido (sperma) of the hero committing\nincest. Life is thus immortalized for the hero because, like the sun, he\ngenerates himself anew. After all the preceding materials, it can no\nlonger be difficult to recognize in the Christian mysteries the human\nsacrifice, or the sacrifice of the son to the mother.[842] Just as Attis\nemasculates himself on account of the mother, so does Christ himself\nhang upon the tree of life,[843] the wood of martyrdom, the ἑκάτη,[844]\nthe chthonic mother, and by that redeems creation from death. By\nentering again into the mother’s womb (Matuta, Pietà of Michelangelo) he\nredeems in death the sin in life of the primitive man, Adam, in order\nsymbolically through his deed[845] to procure for the innermost and most\nhidden meaning of the religious libido its highest satisfaction and most\npronounced expression. The martyrdom of Christ has in Augustine as well\nactually the meaning of a Hierosgamos with the mother (corresponding to\nthe Adonis festival, where Venus and Adonis were laid upon the nuptial\ncouch):\n\n  “Procedit Christus quasi sponsus de thalamo suo, præsagio nuptiarum\n  exiit ad campum sæculi; pervenit usque ad crucis torum (torus has the\n  meaning of bed, pillow, concubine, bier) et ibi firmavit ascendendo\n  conjugium: ubi cum sentiret anhelantem in suspiriis creaturam\n  commercio pietatis se pro conjuge dedit ad pœnam et copulavit sibi\n  perpetuo iure matronam.”\n\nThis passage is perfectly clear. A similar death overtakes the Syrian\nMelcarth, who, riding upon a sea horse, was annually burned. Among the\nGreeks he is called Melicertes, and was represented riding upon a\ndolphin. The dolphin is also the steed of Arion. We have learned to\nrecognize previously the maternal significance of dolphin, so that in\nthe death of Melcarth we can once more recognize the negatively\nexpressed Hierosgamos with the mother. (Compare Frazer “Golden Bough,”\nIV, p. 87.) This figurative expression is of the greatest teleological\nsignificance. Through its symbol it leads that libido which inclines\nbackward into the original, primitive and impulsive upwards to the\nspiritual by investing it with a mysterious but fruitful function. It is\nsuperfluous to speak of the effect of this symbol upon the unconscious\nof Occidental humanity. A glance over history shows what creative forces\nwere released in this symbol.[846]\n\nThe comparison of the Mithraic and the Christian sacrifice plainly shows\nwherein lies the superiority of the Christian symbol; it is the frank\nadmission that not only are the lower wishes to be sacrificed, but the\nwhole personality. The Christian symbol demands complete devotion; it\ncompels a veritable self-sacrifice to a higher purpose, while the\nSacrificium Mithriacum, remaining fixed on a primitive symbolic stage,\nis contented with an animal sacrifice. The religious effect of these\nsymbols must be considered as an orientation of the unconscious by means\nof imitation.\n\nIn Miss Miller’s phantasy there is internal compulsion, in that she\npasses from the horse sacrifice to the self-sacrifice of the hero.\nWhereas the first symbolizes renunciation of the sexual wishes, the\nsecond has the deeper and ethically more valuable meaning of the\nsacrifice of the infantile personality. The object of psychoanalysis has\nfrequently been wrongly understood to mean the renunciation or the\ngratification of the ordinary sexual wish, while, in reality, the\nproblem is the sublimation of the infantile personality, or, expressed\nmythologically, a sacrifice and rebirth of the infantile hero.[847] In\nthe Christian mysteries, however, the resurrected one becomes a\nsupermundane spirit, and the invisible kingdom of God, with its\nmysterious gifts, are obtained by his believers through the sacrifice of\nhimself on the mother. In psychoanalysis the infantile personality is\ndeprived of its libido fixations in a rational manner; the libido which\nis thus set free serves for the building up of a personality matured and\nadapted to reality, who does willingly and without complaint everything\nrequired by necessity. (It is, so to speak, the chief endeavor of the\ninfantile personality to struggle against all necessities and to create\ncoercions for itself where none exist in reality.)",
