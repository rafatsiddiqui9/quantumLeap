Another passage is worth mentioning:\u201cAfter the entire union of the soul had taken place, according to the  master\u2019s mind, he formed all that is corporeal within this, and joined  it together so as to penetrate it throughout.\u201dMoreover, I refer to my remarks about the maternal meaning of the world soul in Plotinus, in Chapter II.\u201cThy mother, the heavens, stretches forth her arms to thee.\u201dIn another place it is said:\u201cThou shinest, oh father of the gods, upon the back of thy mother,  daily thy mother takes thee in her arms. When thou illuminatest the  dwelling of night, thou unitest with thy mother, the heavens.\u201d[566]The Tum of Pitum-Heliopolis not only bears the Crux Ansata as a symbol, but also has this sign as his most frequent surname, that is, \u0101n\u03c7 or \u0101n\u03c7i, which means \u201clife\u201d or \u201cthe living.\u201d He is chiefly honored as the demon serpent, Agatho, of whom it is said, \u201cThe holy demon serpent Agatho goes forth from the city Nezi.\u201d The snake, on account of casting its skin, is the symbol of renewal, as is the scarab\u00e6us, a symbol of the sun, of whom it is said that he, being of masculine sex only, reproduces himself.",

    "question": "How does the text use the symbolism of a mother and a father in relation to the soul?",
    "answer": "The text employs the symbolism of a mother and a father in relation to the soul. It mentions that the heavens, which are referred to as the mother, stretch out her arms to the soul. It also describes the soul, referred to as the father, shining upon the back of its mother and uniting with her when illuminating the dwelling of night. These passages suggest a maternal and paternal relationship in the context of the soul.",
