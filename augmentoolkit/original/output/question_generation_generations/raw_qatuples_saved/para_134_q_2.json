    "paragraph": "From that sexual primal libido which produced millions of eggs and seeds from one small creature derivatives have been developed with the great limitation of the fecundity; derivatives in which the functions are maintained by a special differentiated libido. This differentiated libido is henceforth desexualized because it is dissociated from its original function of egg and sperma production; nor is there any possibility of restoring it to its original function. Thus, in general, the process of development consists in an increasing transformation of the primal libido which only produced products of generation to the secondary functions of allurement and protection of the young. This now presupposes a very different and very complicated relation to reality, a true function of reality, which, functionally inseparable, is bound up with the needs of procreation. Thus the altered mode of procreation carries with it as a correlate a correspondingly heightened adaptation to reality.[264]In this way we attain an insight into certain primitive conditions of the function of reality. It would be radically wrong to say that its compelling power is a sexual one. It was a sexual one to a large extent. The process of transformation of the primal libido into secondary impulses always took place in the form of affluxes of sexual libido, that is to say, sexuality became deflected from its original destination and a portion of it turned, little by little, increasing in amount, into the phylogenetic impulse of the mechanisms of allurement and of protection of the young. This diversion of the sexual libido from the sexual territory into associated functions is still taking place.[265] Where this operation succeeds without injury to the adaptation of the individual it is called _sublimation_. Where the attempt does not succeed it is called _repression_.",

    "question": "What does the text suggest about the relationship between procreation and reality?\n\n**ANS ANSWER:**\nThe text suggests that the altered mode of procreation, which involves secondary functions like allurement and protection of the young, carries with it a heightened adaptation to reality. This means that the process of procreation now requires a different and more complex relationship with reality, which is functionally inseparable from the needs of procreation.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the text describe the process of transformation from the primal libido to secondary impulses?",
    "answer": "The process of transformation from the primal libido to secondary impulses involves affluxes of sexual libido, where a portion of the sexual libido is diverted over time into associated functions such as allurement and protection of the young. This diversion occurs little by little and increases in amount, leading to the development of secondary impulses.",
