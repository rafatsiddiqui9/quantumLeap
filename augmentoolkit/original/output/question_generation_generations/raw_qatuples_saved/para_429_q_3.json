    "paragraph": "At four o\u2019clock in the morning she noticed a moth that flew against the light in her compartment. She then tried to go to sleep again. Suddenly the following poem took possession of her mind._The Moth to the Sun_\u201cI longed for thee when first I crawled to consciousness.    My dreams were all of thee when in the chrysalis I lay.    Oft myriads of my kind beat out their lives    Against some feeble spark once caught from thee.    And one hour more\u2014and my poor life is gone;    Yet my last effort, as my first desire, shall be    But to approach thy glory; then, having gained    One raptured glance, I\u2019ll die content.    For I, the source of beauty, warmth and life    Have in his perfect splendor once beheld.\u201d",

    "question": "What is the final line of the poem, and what does it suggest about the moth's perspective?",
    "answer": "The final line of the poem is \"For I, the source of beauty, warmth and life / Have in his perfect splendor once beheld.\" This suggests that the moth sees itself as a beautiful, warm, and life-giving entity that has seen the perfect splendor of the sun, and it is this experience that motivates its actions and ultimate sacrifice.",
