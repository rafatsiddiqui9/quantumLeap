    "paragraph": "Through the two analyses of children which have been published we have attained an insight into the child\u2019s small world, and have seen what burning interests and questions secretly surround the parents, and that the parents are, for a long time, the objects of the greatest interest.[353] We are, therefore, justified in suspecting that the antique setting applies to the \u201cancients,\u201d that is to say, the parents, and that consequently this Aztec has something of the father or mother in himself. Up to this time indirect hints point only to the mother, which is nothing remarkable in an American girl, because Americans, as a result of the extreme detachment from the father, are characterized by a most enormous mother complex, which again is connected with the especial social position of woman in the United States. This position brings about a special masculinity among capable women, which easily makes possible the symbolizing into a masculine figure.[354]One of my patients in his childhood had always connected the act of defecation with a phantasy that his posterior was a volcano and a violent eruption took place, explosion of gases and gushings forth of lava. The terms for the elemental occurrences of nature are originally not at all poetical; one thinks, for example, of the beautiful phenomenon of the meteor, which the German language most unpoetically calls \u201cSternschnuppe\u201d (the smouldering wick of a star). Certain South American Indians call the shooting star the \u201curine of the stars.\u201d According to the principle of the least resistance, expressions are taken from the nearest source available. (For example, the transference of the metonymic expression of urination as _Schiffens_, \u201cto rain.\u201d)",

    "question": "How does the author's analysis suggest that the \"ancients\" (parents) might have an influence on the \"Aztec\" (child)?",
    "answer": "The author's analysis suggests that the \"ancients,\" who are the parents, have an influence on the \"Aztec,\" or child, to the extent that the child may have something of the parent, specifically the mother, in himself. This indicates a strong connection between the child and the parent, particularly the mother.",
