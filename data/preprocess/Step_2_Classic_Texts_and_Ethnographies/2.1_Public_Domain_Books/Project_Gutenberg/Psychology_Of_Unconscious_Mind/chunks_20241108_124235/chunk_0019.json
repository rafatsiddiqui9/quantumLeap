This\ngreat megalomania thus has a genuinely pitiable background. The\nstrengthening of the consciousness of power is, however, only an\nexternal result of the “becoming-one with God.” Of much more\nsignificance are the deeper-lying disturbances in the realm of feeling.\n_Whoever introverts libido—that is to say, whoever takes it away from a\nreal object without putting in its place a real compensation—is\novertaken by the inevitable results of introversion._ The libido, which\nis turned inward into the subject, awakens again from among the sleeping\nremembrances one which contains the path upon which earlier the libido\nonce had come to the real object. At the very first and in foremost\nposition it was father and mother who were the objects of the childish\nlove. They are unequalled and imperishable. Not many difficulties are\nneeded in an adult’s life to cause those memories to reawaken and to\nbecome effectual. _In religion the regressive reanimation of the\nfather-and-mother imago is organized into a system._ The benefits of\nreligion are the benefits of parental hands; its protection and its\npeace are the results of parental care upon the child; its mystic\nfeelings are the unconscious memories of the tender emotions of the\nfirst childhood, just as the hymn expresses it:\n\n  “I am in my country, I come into my city. Daily am I together with my\n  father Atum.”[128]\n\nThe visible father of the world is, however, the sun, the heavenly fire;\ntherefore, Father, God, Sun, Fire are mythologically synonymous. The\nwell-known fact that in the sun’s strength the great generative power of\nnature is honored shows plainly, very plainly, to any one to whom as yet\nit may not be clear that in the Deity man honors his own libido, and\nnaturally in the form of the image or symbol of the present object of\ntransference. This symbol faces us in an especially marked manner in the\nthird Logos of the Dieterich papyrus. After the second prayer[129] stars\ncome from the disc of the sun to the mystic, “five-pointed, in\nquantities, filling the whole air. If the sun’s disc has expanded, you\nwill see an immeasurable circle, and fiery gates which are shut off.”\nThe mystic utters the following prayer:\n\n  Ἐπακουσόν μου, ἀκουσόν μου—ὁ συνδήσας πνεύματι τὰ πύρινα κλεῖθρα τοῦ\n  οὐρανοῦ, δισώματος πυρίπολε, φωτὸς κτίστα—πυρίπνοε, πυρίθυμε,\n  πνευματόφως, πυριχαρῆ, καλλίφως, φωτοκράτωρ, πυρισώματε, φωτοδότα,\n  πυρισπόρε, πυρικλόνε, φωτόβιε, πυριδῖνα, φωτοκινῆτα, κεραυνοκλόνε,\n  φωτὸς κλέος, αὐξησίφως, ἐνπυρισχησίφως, ἀστροδάμα.[130]\n\nThe invocation is, as one sees, almost inexhaustible in light and fire\nattributes, and can be likened in its extravagance only to the\nsynonymous attributes of love of the mystic of the Middle Ages. Among\nthe innumerable texts which might be used as an illustration of this, I\nselect a passage from the writings of Mechthild von Magdeburg\n(1212–1277):\n\n  “O Lord, love me excessively and love me often and long; the oftener\n  you love me, so much the purer do I become; the more excessively you\n  love me, the more beautiful I become; the longer you love me, the more\n  holy will I become here upon earth.”\n\n  God answered: “That I love you often, that I have from my nature, for\n  I myself am love. That I love you excessively, that I have from my\n  desire, for I too desire that men love me excessively. That I love you\n  long, that I have from my everlastingness, for I am without end.”[131]\n\nThe religious regression makes use indeed of the parent image without,\nhowever, consciously making it an object of transference, for the incest\nhorror[132] forbids that. It remains rather as a synonym, for example,\nof the father or of God, or of the more or less personified symbol of\nthe sun and fire.[133] Sun and fire—that is to say, the fructifying\nstrength and heat—are attributes of the libido. In Mysticism the\ninwardly perceived, divine vision is often merely sun or light, and is\nvery little, or not at all, personified. In the Mithraic liturgy there\nis found, for example, a significant quotation:\n\n  Ἡ δὲ πορεία τῶν ὁρωμένων θεῶν διὰ τοῦ δίσκου, πατρός μου, θεοῦ\n  φανήσεται.[134]\n\nHildegarde von Bingen (1100–1178) expresses herself in the following\nmanner:[135]\n\n  “But the light I see is not local, but far off, and brighter than the\n  cloud which supports the sun. I can in no way know the form of this\n  light since I cannot entirely see the sun’s disc. But within this\n  light I see at times, and infrequently, another light which is called\n  by me the living light, but when and in what manner I see this I do\n  not know how to say, and when I see it all weariness and need is\n  lifted from me, then too, I feel like a simple girl and not like an\n  old woman.”\n\nSymeon, the New Theologian (970–1040), says the following:\n\n  “My tongue lacks words, and what happens in me my spirit sees clearly\n  but does not explain. It sees the invisible, that emptiness of all\n  forms, simple throughout, not complex, and in extent infinite. For it\n  sees no beginning, and it sees no end. It is entirely unconscious of\n  the meanings, and does not know what to call that which it sees.\n  Something complete appears, it seems to me, not indeed through the\n  being itself, but through a participation. For you enkindle fire from\n  fire, and you receive the whole fire; but this remains undiminished\n  and undivided, as before. Similarly, that which is divided separates\n  itself from the first; and like something corporeal spreads itself\n  into several lights. This, however, is something spiritual,\n  immeasurable, indivisible, and inexhaustible. For it is not separated\n  when it becomes many, but remains undivided and is in me, and enters\n  within my poor heart like a sun or circular disc of the sun, similar\n  to the light, for it is a light.”[136]\n\nThat that thing, perceived as inner light, as the sun of the other\nworld, is longing, is clearly shown by Symeon’s words:[137]\n\n  “And following It my spirit demanded to embrace the splendor beheld,\n  but it found It not as creature and did not succeed in coming out from\n  among created beings, so that it might embrace that uncreated and\n  uncomprehended splendor. Nevertheless it wandered everywhere, and\n  strove to behold It. _It penetrated the air, it wandered over the\n  Heavens, it crossed over the abysses, it searched, as it seemed to it,\n  the ends of the world._[138] But in all of that it found nothing, for\n  all was created. And I lamented and was sorrowful, and my breast\n  burned, and I lived as one distraught in mind. But It came, as It\n  would, and descending like a luminous mystic cloud, It seemed to\n  envelop my whole head so that dismayed I cried out. But flying away\n  again It left me alone. And when I, troubled, sought for It, I\n  realized suddenly _that It was in me, myself, and in the midst of my\n  heart It appeared as the light of a spherical sun_.”\n\nIn Nietzsche’s “Glory and Eternity” we meet with an essentially similar\nsymbol:\n\n         “Hush! I see vastness!—and of vasty things\n         Shall man be done, unless he can enshrine\n         Them with his words? Then take the night which brings\n         The heart upon thy tongue, charmed wisdom mine!\n\n         “I look above, there rolls the star-strewn sea.\n         O night, mute silence, voiceless cry of stars!\n         And lo! A sign! The heaven its verge unbars—\n         A shining constellation falls towards me.”[139]\n\nIt is not astonishing if Nietzsche’s great inner loneliness calls again\ninto existence certain forms of thought which the mystic ecstasy of the\nold cults has elevated to ritual representation. In the visions of the\nMithraic liturgy we have to deal with many similar representations which\nwe can now understand without difficulty as the ecstatic symbol of the\nlibido:\n\n  Μετὰ δὲ τὸ ειπεῖν σε τὸν δεύτερον λόγον, ὅπου σιγὴ δὶς καὶ τὰ\n  ἀκόλουθα, σύρισον δὶς καὶ πόππυσον δὶς καὶ εὐθέως ὄψει ἀπὸ τοῦ δίσκου\n  ἀστέρας προσερχομένους πενταδακτυλιαίους πλείστους καὶ πιπλῶντας ὅλον\n  τὸν αέρα. Σὺ δὲ πάλιν λέγε: σιγή, σιγή. Καὶ τοῦ δίσκου ἀνοιγέντος ὄψει\n  ἄπειρον κύκλωμα καὶ θύρας πυρίνας ἀποκεκλεισμένας.[140]\n\nSilence is commanded, then the vision of light is revealed. The\nsimilarity of the mystic’s condition and Nietzsche’s poetical vision is\nsurprising. Nietzsche says “constellation.” It is well known that\nconstellations are chiefly therio- or anthropo-morphic symbols.\n\nThe papyrus says, ἀστέρας πενταδακτυλιαίους[141] (similar to the\n“rosy-fingered” Eos), which is nothing else than an anthropomorphic\nimage. Accordingly, one may expect from that, that by long gazing a\nliving being would be formed out of the “flame image,” a “star\nconstellation” of therio- or anthropo-morphic nature, for the symbolism\nof the libido does not end with sun, light and fire, but makes use of\nwholly other means of expression. I yield precedence to Nietzsche:\n\n                            _The Beacon_[142]\n\n            “Here, where the island grew amid the seas,\n            A sacrificial rock high-towering,\n            Here under darkling heavens,\n            Zarathustra lights his mountain-fires.\n\n            “These flames with grey-white belly,\n            In cold distances sparkle their desire,\n            Stretches its neck towards ever purer heights—\n            A snake upreared in impatience:\n\n            “This signal I set up there before me.\n            This flame is mine own soul,\n            Insatiable for new distances,\n            Speeding upward, upward its silent heat.\n\n            “At all lonely ones I now throw my fishing rod.\n            Give answer to the flame’s impatience,\n            Let me, the fisher on high mountains,\n            Catch my seventh, last solitude!”",
