    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ thus the nimbus around the head of Christ and the halo of the saints in general.\
    \ The Christian legends also attribute many fire and light symbols to the saints.[180]\
    \ The twelve apostles, for example, are likened to the twelve signs of the zodiac,\
    \ and are represented, therefore, with a star over the head.[181]It is not to\
    \ be wondered at that the heathen, as Tertullian avows, considered the sun as\
    \ the Christian God. Among the Manichaeans God was really the sun. One of the\
    \ most remarkable works extant, where the Pagan, Asiatic, Hellenic and Christian\
    \ intermingle, is the Ἐξήγησις περὶ των ἐν Περσίδι πραχθέντων, edited by Wirth.[182]\
    \ This is a book of fables, but, nevertheless, a mine for near-Christian phantasies,\
    \ which gives a profound insight into Christian symbolism. In this is found the\
    \ following magical dedication: Διὶ Ἡλίῳ θεῳ μεγάλῳ βασιλεῖ Ἰησοῦ—.[183] In certain\
    \ parts of Armenia the rising sun is still worshipped by Christians, that “it\
    \ may let its foot rest upon the faces of the worshippers.”[184] The foot occurs\
    \ as an anthropomorphic attribute, and we have already met the theriomorphic attribute\
    \ in the feathers and the sun phallus. Other comparisons of the sun’s ray, as\
    \ knife, sword, arrow, and so on, have also, as we have learned from the psychology\
    \ of the dream, a phallic meaning at bottom. This meaning is attached to the foot\
    \ as I here point out,[185] and also to the feathers, or hair, of the sun, which\
    \ signify the power or strength of the sun. I refer to the story of Samson, and\
    \ to that of the Apocalypse of Baruch, concerning the phœnix bird, which, flying\
