Ad hunc draconem per CCCLXV gradus, quasi ad infernum,  magi cum virginibus sacrilegis descendebant semel in mense cum  sacrificiis et lustris, ex quibus esca poterat tanto draconi inferri.  Hic draco subito ex improviso ascendebat et licet non ingrederetur  vicinos tamen aeres flatu suo vitiabat. Ex quo mortalitas hominum et  maxima luctus de morte veniebat infantum. (Lilith motive.) Sanctus  itaque Silvester cum haberet cum paganis pro defensione veritatis  conflictum, ad hoc venit ut dicerent ei pagani: \u2018Silvester descende ad  draconem et fac eum in nomine Dei tui vel uno anno ab interfectione  generis humani cessare.\u2019\u201d[713]St. Peter appeared to Silvester in a dream and advised him to close his door to the underworld with chains, according to the model in Revelation, chap, xx:(1) \u201cAnd I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the  bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.(2) \u201cAnd he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the  Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.(3) \u201cAnd cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a  seal upon him.\u201dThe anonymous author of a writing, \u201cDe Promissionibus,\u201d[714] of the beginning of the fifth century, mentions a very similar legend:",
