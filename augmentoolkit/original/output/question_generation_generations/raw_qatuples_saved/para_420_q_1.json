    "paragraph": "The teleological meaning of the hero, as that symbolic figure which unites in itself libido in the form of admiration and adoration, in order to lead to higher sublimations by way of the symbolic bridges of the myths, is anticipated here. Thus we become quickly acquainted with Hiawatha as a savior, and are prepared to hear all that which must be said of a savior, of his marvellous birth, of his early great deeds, and his sacrifice for his fellow-men.The first song begins with a fragment of evangelism: Gitche Manito, the \u201cmaster of life,\u201d tired of the quarrels of his human children, calls his people together and makes known to them the joyous message:\u201cI will send a prophet to you,         A Deliverer of the nations,         Who shall guide you and shall teach you,         Who shall toil and suffer with you.         If you listen to his counsels,         You will multiply and prosper.         If his warnings pass unheeded,         You will fade away and perish!\u201dGitche Manito, the Mighty, \u201cthe creator of the nations,\u201d is represented as he stood erect \u201con the great Red Pipestone quarry.\u201d\u201cFrom his footprints flowed a river,          Leaped into the light of morning,          O\u2019er the precipice plunging downward          Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.\u201dThe water flowing from his footsteps sufficiently proves the phallic nature of this creator. I refer to the earlier utterances concerning the phallic and fertilizing nature of the horse\u2019s foot and the horse\u2019s steps, and especially do I recall Hippocrene and the foot of Pegasus.[632] We meet with the same idea in Psalm lxv, vv. 9 to 11:\u201cThou visitest the earth, and waterest it; thou makest it very  plenteous.\u201cThe river of God is full of water; thou preparest their corn, for so  thou providest for the earth.",

    "question": "How does the text describe Gitche Manito, and what message does he convey to his people?\n\n**ANSSEQNWER:**\nGitche Manito is described as the \"master of life\" and \"the creator of the nations.\" He calls his people together and announces a joyous message about sending a prophet, a Deliverer of the nations, who will guide and teach them, toil and suffer with them. If they listen to his counsel, they will multiply and prosper, but if his warnings are unheeded, they will fade away and perish.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat physical act does Gitche Manito perform, and what does it symbolize according to the text?",
    "answer": "Gitche Manito stands erect on the \"great Red Pipestone quarry.\" The water flowing from his footprints symbolizes the phallic and fertilizing nature of this creator, connecting to earlier concepts of phallic and fertilizing footprints, such as those of the horse and Pegasus. This symbolizes his creative and life-giving power.",
