    "paragraph": "Instead of thus employing the libido in the real world, however, certain people never relinquish the seeking for satisfaction in the shadowy world of phantasy and even though they make certain attempts at adaptation they are halted and discouraged by every difficulty and obstacle in the path of life and are easily pulled back into their inner psychic world. This condition is called a state of _introversion_. It is concerned with the past and the reminiscences which belong thereto. Situations and experiences which should have been completed and finished long ago are still dwelt upon and lived with. Images and matters which were once important but which normally have no significance for their later age are still actively influencing their present lives. The nature and character of these phantasy products are legion, and are easily recognized in the emotional attitudes and pretensions, the childish illusions and exaggerations, the prejudices and inconsistencies which people express in manifold forms. The actual situation is inadequately faced; small matters are reacted towards in an exaggerated manner; or else a frivolous attitude is maintained where real seriousness is demanded. In other words, there is clearly manifested an inadequate psychic adaptation towards reality which is quite to be expected from the child, but which is very discordant in the adult.The most important of these past influences is that of the parents. Because they are the first objects of the developing childish love, and afford the first satisfaction and pleasure to the child, they become the models for all succeeding efforts, as Freud has worked out. This he called the _nuclear_ or _root complex_ because this influence was so powerful it seemed to be the determining factor in all later difficulties in the life of the individual.",

    "question": "How do past influences, particularly those of parents, affect an individual's psyche according to the text?",
    "answer": "Past influences, especially those of parents, significantly impact an individual's psyche. Parents are the first sources of love and satisfaction for a child, serving as models for future relationships and experiences. This influence is so powerful that Freud referred to it as the _nuclear_ or _root complex_. It seems to be a determining factor in many later life difficulties, shaping the individual's behavior and emotional responses.",
