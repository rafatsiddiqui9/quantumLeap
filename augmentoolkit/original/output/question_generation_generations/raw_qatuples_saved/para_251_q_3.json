    "paragraph": "These poems describe more plainly than could be depicted with meagre words the persistent arrest and the constantly growing estrangement from life, the gradual deep immersion into the maternal abyss of the individual being. The apocalyptic song of Patmos is strangely related to these songs of retrogressive longing. It enters as a dismal guest surrounded by the mist of the depths, the gathering clouds of insanity, bred through the mother. In it the primitive thoughts of the myth, the suggestion clad in symbols, of the sun-like death and resurrection of life, again burst forth. Similar things are to be found in abundance among sick people of this sort.I reproduce some significant fragments from Patmos:\u201cNear is the God            And hard to comprehend,            But where Danger threatens            The Rescuer appears.\u201dThese words mean that the libido has now sunk to the lowest depths, where \u201cthe danger is great.\u201d (Faust, Part II, Mother scene.) There \u201cthe God is near\u201d; there man may find the inner sun, his own nature, sun-like and self-renewing, hidden in the mother-womb like the sun in the nighttime:\u201c... In Chasms       And in darkness dwell       The eagles; and fresh and fearlessly       The Sons of the Alps pass swiftly over the abyss       Upon lightly swinging bridges.\u201dWith these words the dark phantastic poem passes on. The eagle, the bird of the sun, dwells in darkness\u2014the libido has hidden itself, but high above it the inhabitants of the mountains pass, probably the gods (\u201cYe are walking above in the light\u201d), symbols of the sun wandering across the sky, like the eagle flying over the depths:",
