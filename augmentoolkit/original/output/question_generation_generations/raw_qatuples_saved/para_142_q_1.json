This is precious before God,  and this is the glory of the Lord, and the adornment of our God, when  you stand in the image and honor of your God, as God created you,  naked and not ashamed.\u201cWho can ever praise sufficiently in the sons and daughters of the  living God those parts of the body which are destined to procreate?\u201cIn the lap of the daughters of Jerusalem is the gate of the Lord, and  the Just will go into the temple there, to the altar.[756] And in the  lap of the sons of the living God is the water-pipe of the upper part,  which is a tube, like a rod, to measure the temple and altar. And  under the water-tube the sacred stones are placed, as a sign and  testimony of the Lord, who has taken to himself the seed of Abraham.\u201cOut of the seeds in the chamber of the mother, God creates a man with  his hands, as an image of himself. Then the mother house and the  mother chamber is opened in the daughters of the Living God, and God  himself brings forth a child through them. Thus God creates children  from the stones, for the seed comes from the stones.\u201d[757]",
