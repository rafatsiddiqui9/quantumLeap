- content: 'Text: """The enquiry made possible by Freud’s work has already resulted
    fruitfully; we are indebted to this stimulation for some bold attacks upon the
    territory of the history of the human mind. There are the works of Riklin,[5]
    Abraham,[6] Rank,[7] Maeder,[8] Jones,[9]—recently Silberer has joined their ranks
    with a beautiful investigation entitled “Phantasie und Mythus.”[10] We are indebted
    to Pfister[11] for a comprehensive work which cannot be overlooked here, and which
    is of much importance for Christian religious psychology. The leading purpose
    of these works is the unlocking of historical problems through the application
    of psychoanalytic knowledge; that is to say, knowledge drawn from the activity
    of the modern unconscious mind concerning specific historical material.I must
    refer the reader entirely to the specified works, in order that he may gain information
    concerning the extent and the kind of insight which has already been obtained.
    The explanations are in many cases dubious in particulars; nevertheless, this
    detracts in no way from the total result. It would be significant enough if only
    the far-reaching analogy between the psychologic structure of the historical relics
    and the structure of the recent individual psychologic products alone were demonstrated.
    This proof is possible of attainment for every intelligent person through the
    work done up to this time. The analogy prevails especially in symbolism, as Riklin,
    Rank, Maeder, and Abraham have pointed out with illuminating examples; it is also
    shown in the individual mechanisms of unconscious work, that is to say in repression,
    condensation, etc., as Abraham explicitly shows."""
