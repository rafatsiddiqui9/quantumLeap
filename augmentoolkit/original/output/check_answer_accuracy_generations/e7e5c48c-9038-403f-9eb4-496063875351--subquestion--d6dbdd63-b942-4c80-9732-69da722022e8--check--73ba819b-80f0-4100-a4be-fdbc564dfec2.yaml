- content: 'Text: """parallel to the substitution of the missing phallus of Osiris.
    Mithra is represented in a special ceremony, holding the bull’s shoulder over
    Sol, his son and vice-regent. This scene may be compared to a sort of dedication,
    or accolade (something like the ceremony of confirmation). The blow of the hammer
    as a generating, fructifying, inspiring function is retained as a folk-custom
    and expressed by striking with the twig of life, which has the significance of
    a charm of fertility. In the neuroses, the sexual meaning of castigation plays
    an important part, for among many children castigation may elicit a sexual orgasm.
    The ritual act of striking has the same significance of generating (fructifying),
    and is, indeed, merely a variant of the original phallic ceremonial. Of similar
    character to the bull’s shoulder is the cloven hoof of the devil, to which a sexual
    meaning also appertains. The ass’s jawbone wielded by Samson has the same worth.
    In the Polynesian Maui myth the jawbone, the weapon of the hero, is derived from
    the man-eating woman, Muriranga-whenua, whose body swells up enormously from lusting
    for human flesh (Frobenius). Hercules’ club is made from the wood of the maternal
