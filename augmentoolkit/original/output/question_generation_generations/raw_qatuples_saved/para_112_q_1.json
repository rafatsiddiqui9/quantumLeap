    "paragraph": "philosophers for them to manage. For the rest I refer to the words of Schopenhauer[253] relating to this. In connection with the psychology of this conception (by which I understand neither metapsychology nor metaphysics) I am reminded here of the cosmogenic meaning of Eros in Plato and Hesiod,[254] and also of the orphic figure of Phanes, the \u201c_shining one_,\u201d the first created, the \u201cfather of Eros.\u201d Phanes has also orphically the significance of Priapus; he is a god of love, bisexual and similar to the Theban Dionysus Lysios.[255] The orphic meaning of Phanes is similar to that of the Indian K\u00e2ma, the god of love, which is also the cosmogenic principle. To Plotinus, of the Neo-Platonic school, the world-soul is the energy of the intellect.[256] Plotinus compares \u201cThe One,\u201d the creative primal principle, with light in general; the intellect with the Sun (\u2642), the world-soul with the moon (\u2640). In another comparison Plotinus compares \u201cThe One\u201d with the Father, the intellect with the Son.[257] The \u201cOne\u201d designated as Uranus is transcendent. The son as Kronos has dominion over the visible world. The world-soul (designated as Zeus) appears as subordinate to him. The \u201cOne,\u201d or the Usia of the whole existence is designated by Plotinus as hypostatic, also as the three forms of emanation, also \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u1f76\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.[258] As Drews observed, this is also the formula of the Christian Trinity (God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost) as it was decided upon at the councils of Nicea and Constantinople.[259] It may also be noticed that certain early Christian sectarians attributed a maternal significance to the Holy Ghost (world-soul, moon). (See what follows concerning Chi of Tim\u00e6us.) According to Plotinus, the world-soul has a tendency toward a divided existence and towards divisibility, the _conditio sine qua non_ of all change, creation and procreation (also a maternal quality).",
