    "question": "How does the narrator describe their ability to influence another person in terms of creating the perception of places and atmospheres they have never experienced?",
    "answer": "The narrator describes their ability to make someone imagine landscapes, such as the Lake Geneva (Lake L\u00e9man), that they have never seen, and to instill a sense of an environment they have never felt directly. They note that they use the person as a mere instrument, similar to how the person uses their pencil, to create these experiences.",
