    "paragraph": "The Logos became a cow; that is to say, the mother, who is pregnant with the gods. (In Christian uncanonical phantasies, where the Holy Ghost has feminine significance, we have the well-known motive of the two mothers, the earthly mother, Mary, and the spiritual mother, the Holy Ghost.) The transformation of the Logos into the mother is not remarkable in itself, because the origin of the phenomenon fire-speech seems to be the mother-libido, according to the discussion in the earlier chapter.

The significance of the sword, in the Sanskrit conception, t\u00eajas, is probably partly determined by its sharpness, as is shown above, in its connection with the libido conception. The motive of pursuit (the pursuing Sieglinde, analogous to Leto) is not here bound up with the spiritual mother, but with Wotan, therefore corresponding to the Linos legend, where the father of the wife is also the pursuer. Wotan is also the father of Brunhilde. Brunhilde stands in a peculiar relation to Wotan. Brunhilde says to Wotan:\u201cThou speakest to the will of Wotan By telling me what thou wishest:  Who ... am I Were I not thy will?\u201d_Wotan_:I take counsel only with myself, When I speak with thee....",

This is similar to the Linos legend where the father of the wife also pursues her, further emphasizing the connection between Wotan and the pursuit motive.",
