{"paragraph": "With this we turn once more to Nietzsche\u2019s poem, \u201cThe Beacon.\u201d We found the flame there used as an image of the libido, theriomorphically represented as a snake (also as an image of the soul:[154] \u201cThis flame is mine own soul\u201d). We saw that the snake is to be taken as a phallic image of the libido (upreared in impatience), and that this image, also an attribute of the conception of the sun (the Egyptian sun idol), is an image of the libido in the combination of sun and phallus. It is not a wholly strange conception, therefore, that the sun\u2019s disc is represented with a penis, as well as with hands and feet. We find proof for this idea in a peculiar part of the Mithraic liturgy: \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f21 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5. \u1f4c\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd.[155]This extremely important vision of a tube hanging down from the sun would produce in a religious text, such as that of the Mithraic liturgy, a strange and at the same time meaningless effect if it did not have the phallic meaning. The tube is the place of origin of the wind. The phallic meaning seems very faint in this idea, but one must remember that the wind, as well as the sun, is a fructifier and creator. This has already been pointed out in a footnote.[156] There is a picture by a Germanic painter of the Middle Ages of the \u201cconceptio immaculata\u201d which deserves mention here. The conception is represented by a tube or pipe coming down from heaven and passing beneath the skirt of Mary. Into this flies the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove for the impregnation of the Mother of God.[157]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
