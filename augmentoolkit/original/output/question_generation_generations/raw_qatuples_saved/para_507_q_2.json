Rise up from your bed of branches;         Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!\u201dMondamin is the maize: a god, who is eaten, arising from Hiawatha\u2019s introversion. His hunger, taken in a double sense, his longing for the nourishing mother, gives birth from his soul to another hero, the edible maize, the son of the earth mother. Therefore, he again arises at sunset, symbolizing the entrance into the mother, and in the western sunset glow he begins again the mystic struggle with the self-created god, the god who has originated entirely from the longing for the nourishing mother. The struggle is again the struggle for liberation from this destructive and yet productive longing. Mondamin is, therefore, equivalent to the mother, and the struggle with him means the overpowering and impregnation of the mother. This interpretation is entirely proven by a myth of the Cherokees, \u201cwho invoke it (the maize) under the name of \u2018The Old Woman,\u2019 in allusion to a myth that it sprang from the blood of an old woman killed by her disobedient sons\u201d:[654]",
