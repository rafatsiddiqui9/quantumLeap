    "paragraph": "We might say that the real transference taught in the Christian community is the condition absolutely necessary for the efficacy of the miracle of redemption; the first letter of John comes out frankly with this:\u201cHe that loveth his brother abideth in the light.\u201d\u2014_I John_ ii: 10.\u201cIf we love one another, God abideth in us.\u201d\u2014_I John_ iv: 12.The Deity continues to be efficacious in the Christian religion only upon the foundation of brotherly love. Consequently, here too the mystery of redemption is the unresisting real transference.[87] One may properly ask one\u2019s self, for what then is the Deity useful, if his efficacy consists only in the _real transference_? To this also the evangelical message has a striking answer:\u201cMen are all brothers in Christ.\u201d\u201cSo Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many,  shall appear a second time apart from sin to them that wait for him  unto salvation.\u201d\u2014_Heb._ ix: 28.",

    "question": "How does the concept of brotherly love relate to the Deity's role in the Christian religion?",
    "answer": "Brotherly love is the foundation upon which the Deity's efficacy in the Christian religion is built. The Deity is only efficacious in the Christian religion through the expression of brotherly love among believers. This means that the Deity's power and effectiveness are contingent upon the presence and practice of brotherly love.",
