    \ text, and a question based on the paragraphs, you will make a determination\
    \ as to whether the question tests ONLY information in the paragraphs. Essentially:\
    \ you will check if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs.\
    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\
    \ at the very end of your response, your \"final judgment\" or \"final answer\"\
    , you will write \"Relevant\" or \"Irrelevant\" depending on your analysis of\
    \ the question with regards to the text. \n\nNote a special exception: if a question\
    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ through the serpent, which always points to a secret related thought. This related\
    \ thought connects with the mother; thus, in a dream a patient found the following\
    \ imagery: “A serpent shot out from a moist cave and bit the dreamer in the region\
    \ of the genitals.” This dream took place at the instant when the patient was\
    \ convinced of the truth of the analysis, and began to free himself from the bond\
    \ of his mother complex. The meaning is: I am convinced that I am inspired and\
    \ poisoned by the mother. The contrary manner of expression is characteristic\
    \ of the dream. At the moment when he felt the impulse to go forwards he perceived\
    \ the attachment to the mother. Another patient had the following dream during\
    \ a relapse, in which the libido was again wholly introverted for a time: “She\
    \ was entirely filled within by a great snake; only one end of the tail peeped\
    \ out from her arm. She wanted to seize it, but it escaped her.” A patient with\
    \ a very strong introversion (catatonic state) complained to me that a snake was\
    \ stuck in her throat.[759] This symbolism is also used by Nietzsche in the “vision”\
    \ of the shepherd and the snake:[760]“And verily, what I saw was like nothing\
    \ I ever saw before. I saw a  young shepherd, writhing, choking, twitching with\
    \ a convulsed face,  from whose mouth hung a black, heavy serpent.“Did I ever\
    \ see so much disgust and pallid fear upon a  countenance?[761] Might he have\
    \ been sleeping, and the snake crept  into his mouth—there it bit him fast?“My\
    \ hand tore at the serpent and tore—in vain!—I failed to tear the  serpent out\
    \ of his mouth. Then there cried out of me: ‘Bite! Bite! Its  head off! Bite!’\
    \ I exclaimed; all my horror, my hate, my disgust, my  compassion, all the good\
    \ and bad cried out from me in one voice.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\
