    "paragraph": "One need not assume that there is a direct dependency between the Apocalypse and the Mithraic liturgy. The visionary images of both texts are developed from a source, not limited to one place, but found in the soul of many divers people, because the symbols which arise from it are too typical for it to belong to one individual only. I put these images here to show how the primitive symbolism of light gradually developed, with the increasing depth of the vision, into the idea of the sun-hero, the \u201cwell-beloved.\u201d[168] The development of the symbol of light is thoroughly typical. In addition to this, perhaps I might call to mind the fact that I have previously pointed out this course with numerous examples,[169] and, therefore, I can spare myself the trouble of returning to this subject.[170] These visionary occurrences are the psychological roots of the sun-coronations in the mysteries. Its rite is religious hallucination congealed into liturgical form, which, on account of its great regularity, could become a generally accepted outer form. After all this, it is easily understood how the ancient Christian Church, on one side, stood in an especial bond to Christ as \u201csol novus,\u201d and, on the other side, had a certain difficulty in freeing itself from the earthly symbols of Christ. Indeed Philo of Alexandria saw in the sun the image of the divine logos or of the Deity especially (\u201cDe Somniis,\u201d 1:85). In an Ambrosian hymn Christ is invoked by \u201cO sol salutis,\u201d and so on. At the time of Marcus Aurelius, Meliton, in his work,[171] \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5, called Christ the \u1f2d\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 ... \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f57\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u2019 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6.[172]Still more important is a passage from Pseudo-Cyprian:[173]",

    "question": "What does the text imply about the relationship between the ancient Christian Church and the symbolism of the sun?\n\n**ANSIDE:**\nThe text implies that the ancient Christian Church had a special bond with Christ as \"sol novus\" (new sun). However, it also notes that the Church had a certain difficulty in freeing itself from earthly symbols associated with Christ. This is further supported by examples where Christ is invoked with the title \"O sol salutis\" in an Ambrosian hymn.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow did the symbol of the sun find expression in Christian liturgy and writings?",
    "answer": "The symbol of the sun found expression in Christian liturgy and writings through phrases such as \"O sol salutis\" in Ambrosian hymns, and in texts like Meliton's work, \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5,\" where Christ is described as \"Helios anatoles\" (sun of dawn) and \"mousos helios\" (only sun that rose from heaven).",
