Then speech  serves him as light; then, by the light of speech he sits, and moves,  he carries on his work, and he returns home. But when the sun is set,  O Yay\u00f1avalkya, and the moon is set, and the fire extinguished, and the  voice is dumb, what then serves man as light? Then he serves himself  (Atman) as light; then, by the light of himself, he sits and moves,  carries on his work and returns home.\u201dIn this passage we notice that fire again stands in the closest relation to speech. Speech itself is called a \u201clight,\u201d which, in its turn, is reduced to the \u201clight\u201d of the Atman, the creating psychic force, the libido. Thus the Hindoo metapsychology conceives speech and fire as emanations of the inner light from which we know that it is libido. Speech and fire are its forms of manifestation, the first human arts, which have resulted from its transformation. This common psychologic origin seems also to be indicated by certain results of philology. The Indo-Germanic root _bh\u00e2_ designates the idea of \u201cto lighten, to shine.\u201d This root is found in Greek, \u03c6\u03ac\u03c9, \u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9, \u03c6\u03ac\u03bf\u03c2[322]; in old Icelandic _b\u00e1n_ = white, in New High German _bohnen_ = to make shining. The same root _bh\u00e2_ also designates \u201cto speak\u201d; it is found in Sanskrit _bhan_ = to speak, Armenian _ban_ = word, in New High German _bann_ = to banish, Greek \u03c6\u1fb1-\u03bc\u03af, \u1f14\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd, \u03c6\u1ea5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2.[323] Latin _f\u00e2-ri_, _f\u00e2num_.The root _bhelso_, with the meanings \u201cto ring, to bark,\u201d is found in Sanskrit _bhas_ = to bark and _bh\u00e2s_ = to talk, to speak; Lithuanian _balsas_ = voice, tone. Really _bhel-s\u00f4_ = to be bright or luminous. Compare Greek \u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 = bright, Lithuanian _b\u00e1lti_ = to become white, Middle High German _blasz_ = pale.",
