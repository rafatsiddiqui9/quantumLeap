    "paragraph": "Ship and tree of the dead (death ship and death tree) are here closely connected. The conception is that R\u00e2, born from the tree, ascends (Osiris in the Erika). The representation of the sun-god Mithra is probably explained in the same way. He is represented upon the Heddernheim relief, with half his body arising from the top of a tree. (In the same way numerous other monuments show Mithra half embodied in the rock, and illustrate a rock birth, similar to Men.) Frequently there is a stream near the birthplace of Mithra. This conglomeration of symbols is also found in the birth of Aschanes, the first Saxon king, who grew from the Harz rocks, which are in the midst of the wood[505] near a fountain.[506] Here we find all the mother symbols united\u2014earth, wood, water, three forms of tangible matter. We can wonder no longer that in the Middle Ages the tree was poetically addressed with the title of honor, \u201cmistress.\u201d Likewise it is not astonishing that the Christian legend transformed the tree of death, the cross, into the tree of life, so that Christ was often represented on a living and fruit-bearing tree. This reversion of the cross symbol to the tree of life, which even in Babylon was an important and authentic religious symbol, is also considered entirely probable by Z\u00f6ckler,[507] an authority on the history of the cross. The pre-Christian meaning of the symbol does not contradict this interpretation; on the contrary, its meaning is life. The appearance of the cross in the sun worship (here the cross with equal arms, and the swastika cross, as representative of the sun\u2019s rays), as well as in the cult of the goddess of love (Isis with the crux ansata, the rope, the speculum veneris \u2640, etc.), in no way contradicts the previous historical meaning. The Christian legend has made abundant use of this symbolism.[Illustration: CHRIST ON THE TREE OF LIFE]",

    "question": "What is the connection between the ship and tree of the dead (death ship and death tree) in the context of the sun-god Mithra?",
    "answer": "The ship and tree of the dead in the context of Mithra are closely connected because Mithra is often represented as emerging from the top of a tree, symbolizing his birth or resurrection. This representation is similar to the Egyptian god R\u00e2, who is also sometimes depicted as rising from a tree.",
