    "paragraph": "\u201cThe son of Saturn spake, and took his wife     Into his arms, while underneath the pair,     The sacred Earth threw up her freshest herbs:     The dewy lotos, and the crocus-flower,     And thick and soft the hyacinth. All these     Upbore them from the ground. Upon this couch     They lay, while o\u2019er them a bright golden cloud     Gathered and shed its drops of glistening dew.     So slumbered on the heights of Gargarus     The All-Father overcome by sleep and love,     And held his consort in his arms.\u201d                    \u2014Trans. by W. C. Bryant.Drexler recognizes in this description an unmistakable allusion to the garden of the gods on the extreme western shore of the ocean, an idea which might have been taken from a Prehomeric Hierosgamos hymn. This western land is the land of the setting sun, whither Hercules, Gilgamesh, etc., hasten with the sun, in order to find there immortality, where the sun and the maternal sea unite in an eternally rejuvenating intercourse. Our supposition of a condensation of the Hierosgamos with the myth of rebirth is probably confirmed by this. Pausanias mentions a related myth fragment where the statue of Artemis Orthia is also called Lygodesma (chained with willows), because it was found in a willow tree; this tale seems to be related to the general Greek celebration of Hierosgamos with the above-mentioned customs.[493]The motive of the \u201cdevouring\u201d which Frobenius has shown to be a regular constituent of the sun myths is closely related to this (also metaphorically). The \u201cwhale dragon\u201d (mother\u2019s womb) always \u201cdevours\u201d the hero. The devouring may also be partial instead of complete.",

    "question": "What is the \"devouring\" motif in sun myths, and how is it related to the myth of rebirth and the mother's womb?",
    "answer": "The \"devouring\" motif in sun myths refers to a recurring element where a \"whale dragon\" (metaphorically representing the mother's womb) \"devours\" the hero. This devouring can be complete or partial and is closely related to the theme of rebirth, as the hero is reborn or renewed after being consumed by the maternal force.",
