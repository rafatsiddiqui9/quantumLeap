    "paragraph": "We would show but slight justice, however, to the intellectual originality of our author, if we were satisfied to trace back the commotion of that sleepless night absolutely and entirely to the sexual problem in a narrow sense. That would be but one-half, and truly, to make use of the mystic\u2019s expression, only the under half. The other half is the intellectual sublimation, which strives to make true in its own way the ambiguous expression of \u201cthe idea which produces its object spontaneously,\u201d\u2014_ideal creation in place of the real_.In such an intellectual accomplishment of an evidently very capable personality, the prospect of a spiritual fruitfulness is something which is worthy of the highest aspiration, since for many it will become a necessity of life. Also this side of the phantasy explains, to a great extent, the excitement, for it is a thought with a presentiment of the future; one of those thoughts which arise, to use one of Maeterlinck\u2019s expressions,[76] from the \u201cinconscient sup\u00e9rieur,\u201d that \u201cprospective potency\u201d of subliminal combinations.[77]I have had the opportunity of observing certain cases of neuroses of years\u2019 duration, in which, at the time of the beginning of the illness or shortly before, a dream occurred, often of visionary clarity. This impressed itself inextinguishably upon the memory, and in analysis revealed a hidden meaning to the patient which anticipated the subsequent events of life; that is to say, their psychologic meaning.[78] I am inclined to grant this meaning to the commotion of that restless night, because the resulting events of life, in so far as Miss Miller consciously and unconsciously unveils them to us, are entirely of a nature to confirm the supposition that that moment is to be considered as the inception and presentiment of a sublimated aim in life.Miss Miller concludes the list of her fancies with the following remarks:",

    "question": "How does the author suggest that the intellectual sublimation affects the excitement of the individual?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the intellectual sublimation affects the excitement of the individual by providing a thought with a presentiment of the future. This thought comes from the \"inconscient sup\u00e9rieur,\" the \"prospective potency\" of subliminal combinations, and serves as a guide for the individual's future actions and aspirations.",
