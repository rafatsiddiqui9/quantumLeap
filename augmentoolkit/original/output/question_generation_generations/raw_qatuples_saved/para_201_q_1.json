    "paragraph": "A similar detachment of the symbol of the cross from a concrete figure we find among the Muskhogean Indians, who stretch above the surface of the water (pond or stream) two ropes crosswise and at the point of intersection throw into the water fruits, oil and precious stones as a sacrifice.[561] Here the divinity is evidently the water, not the cross, which designates the place of sacrifice only, through the point of intersection. The sacrifice at the place of union indicates why this symbol was a primitive charm of fertility,[562] why we meet it so frequently in the prechristian era among the goddesses of love (mother goddesses), especially among the Egyptians in Isis and the sun-god. We have already discussed the continuous union of these two divinities. As the cross (Tau [\u03a4], Crux Ansata) always recurs in the hand of Tum, the supreme God, the hegemon of the Ennead, it may not be superfluous to say something more of the destination of Tum. The Tum of On-Heliopolis bears the name \u201cthe father of his mother\u201d; what that means needs no explanation; Jusas or Nebit-Hotpet, the goddess joined to him, _was called sometimes the mother, sometimes the daughter, sometimes the wife of the god_. The day of the beginning of autumn is designated in the Heliopolitan inscriptions as the \u201cfestival of the goddess Jusasit,\u201d as \u201cthe arrival of the sister for the purpose of uniting with her father.\u201d It is the day in which \u201cthe goddess Mehnit completes her work, so that the god Osiris may enter into the left eye.\u201d (By which the moon is meant.[563]) The day is also called the filling up of the sacred eye with its needs. The heavenly cow with the moon eye, the cow-headed Isis, takes to herself in the autumn equinox the seed which procreates Horus. (Moon as keeper of the seed.) The \u201ceye\u201d evidently represents the genitals, as in the myth of Indra, who had to bear spread over his whole body the likeness of Yoni (vulva), on account of a Bathsheba outrage, ",

    "question": "How does the cross shape function in these rituals?",
    "answer": "The cross shape (Tau [\u03a4], Crux Ansata) designates the place of sacrifice only. It is used to mark the point where offerings are thrown into the water, indicating that the water itself is the deity being worshiped.",
