(Compare above _svénô_, Zend _qanañt_); Gothic _sun-na_,\n_sunnô_.[325] Here Goethe has preceded us:\n\n               “The sun orb sings in emulation,\n               ’Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round:\n               His path predestined through Creation,\n               He ends with step of thunder sound.”\n                                       —_Faust._ Part I.\n\n              “Hearken! Hark! the hours careering!\n              Sounding loud to spirit-hearing,\n              See the new-born Day appearing!\n              Rocky portals jarring shatter,\n              Phœbus’ wheels in rolling clatter,\n              With a crash the Light draws near!\n              Pealing rays and trumpet-blazes,\n              Eye is blinded, ear amazes;\n              The Unheard can no one hear!\n              Slip within each blossom-bell,\n              Deeper, deeper, there to dwell,—\n              In the rocks, beneath the leaf!\n              If it strikes you, you are deaf.”\n                                        —_Faust._ Part II.\n\nWe also must not forget the beautiful verse of Hölderlin:\n\n             “Where art thou? Drunken, my soul dreams\n             Of all thy rapture. Yet even now I hearken\n             As full of golden tones the radiant sun youth\n             Upon his heavenly lyre plays his even song\n             To the echoing woods and hills.”\n\nJust as in archaic speech fire and the speech sounds (the mating call,\nmusic) appear as forms of emanation of the libido, thus light and sound\nentering the psyche become one: libido.\n\nManilius expresses it in his beautiful verses:\n\n                 “Quid mirum noscere mundum\n   Si possunt homines, quibus est et mundus in ipsis\n   Exemplumque dei quisque est in imagine parva?\n   An quoquam genitos nisi cælo credere fas est\n   Esse homines?\n                 Stetit unus in arcem\n   Erectus capitis victorque ad sidera mittit sidereos oculos.”[326]\n\nThe idea of the Sanskrit _têjas_ suggests the fundamental significance\nof the libido for the conception of the world in general. I am indebted\nto Dr. Abegg, in Zurich, a thorough Sanskrit scholar, for the\ncompilation of the eight meanings of this word.\n\n_Têjas_ signifies:\n\n  1. Sharpness, cutting edge.\n\n  2. Fire, splendor, light, glow, heat.\n\n  3. Healthy appearance, beauty.\n\n  4. The fiery and color-producing power of the human organism (thought\n  to be in the bile).\n\n  5. Power, energy, vital force.\n\n  6. Passionate nature.\n\n  7. Mental, also magic, strength; influence, position, dignity.\n\n  8. Sperma.\n\nThis gives us a dim idea of how, for primitive thought, the so-called\nobjective world was, and had to be, a subjective image. To this thought\nmust be applied the words of the “Chorus Mysticus”:\n\n                        “All that is perishable\n                        Is only an allegory.”\n\nThe Sanskrit word for fire is _agnis_ (the Latin _ignis_);[327] the fire\npersonified is the god Agni, the divine mediator,[328] whose symbol has\ncertain points of contact with that of Christ. In Avesta and in the\nVedas the fire is the messenger of the gods. In the Christian mythology\ncertain parts are closely related with the myth of Agni. Daniel speaks\nof the three men in the fiery furnace:\n\n  “Then Nebuchadnezar, the King, was astonished, and rose up in haste\n  and spake, and said unto his counsellors: ‘Did not we cast three men\n  bound into the midst of the fire?’\n\n  “They answered and said: ‘True, O King!’\n\n  “He answered and said: ‘Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst\n  of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like\n  the Son of God.’”\n\nIn regard to that the “Biblia pauperum” observes (according to an old\nGerman incunabulum of 1471):\n\n  “One reads in the third chapter of the prophet Daniel that\n  Nebuchadnezar, the King, caused three men to be placed in a glowing\n  furnace and that the king often went there, looked in, and that he saw\n  with the three, a fourth, who was like the Son of God. The three\n  signify for us, the Holy Trinity and the fourth, the unity of the\n  being. Christ, too, in His explanation designated the person of the\n  Trinity and the unity of the being.”\n\nAccording to this mystic interpretation, the legend of the three men in\nthe fiery furnace appears as a magic fire ceremony by means of which the\nSon of God reveals himself. The Trinity is brought together with the\nunity, or, in other words, through coitus a child is produced. The\nglowing furnace (like the glowing tripod in “Faust”) is a mother symbol,\nwhere the children are produced.[329] The fourth in the fiery furnace\nappears as Christ, the Son of God, who has become a visible God in the\nfire. The mystic trinity and unity are sexual symbols. (Compare with\nthat the many references in Inman: “Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian\nSymbolism.”) It is said of the Saviour of Israel (the Messiah) and of\nhis enemies, _Isaiah_ x:17:\n\n  “And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a\n  flame.”\n\nIn a hymn of the Syrian Ephrem it is said of Christ: “Thou who art all\nfire, have mercy upon me.”\n\nAgni is the sacrificial flame, the sacrificer, and the sacrificed, as\nChrist himself. Just as Christ left behind his redeeming blood, φάρμακον\nἀθανασίας,[330] in the stimulating wine, so Agni is the Soma, the holy\ndrink of inspiration, the mead of immortality.[331] Soma and Fire are\nentirely identical in Hindoo literature, so that in Soma we easily\nrediscover the libido symbol, through which a series of apparently\nparadoxical qualities of the Soma are immediately explained. As the old\nHindoos recognized in fire an emanation of the inner libido fire, so too\nthey recognized, in the intoxicating drink (Firewater, Soma-Agni, as\nrain and fire), an emanation of libido. The Vedic definition of Soma as\nseminal fluid confirms this interpretation.[332] The Soma significance\nof fire, similar to the significance of the body of Christ in the Last\nSupper (compare the Passover lamb of the Jews, baked in the form of a\ncross), is explained by the psychology of the presexual stage, where the\nlibido was still in part the function of nutrition. The “Soma” is the\n“nourishing drink,” the mythological characterization of which runs\nparallel to fire in its origin; therefore, both are united in Agni. The\ndrink of immortality was stirred by the Hindoo gods like fire. Through\nthe retreat of the libido into the presexual stage it becomes clear why\nso many gods were either defined sexually or were devoured.\n\nAs was shown by our discussion of fire preparation, the fire tool did\nnot receive its sexual significance as a later addition, but the sexual\nlibido was the motor power which led to its discovery, so that the later\nteachings of the priests were nothing but confirmations of its actual\norigin. Other primitive discoveries probably have acquired their sexual\nsymbolism in the same manner, being also derived from the sexual libido.\n\nIn the previous statements, which were based on the Pramantha of the\nAgni sacrifice, we have concerned ourselves only with one significance\nof the word manthâmi or mathnâmi, that is to say, with that which\nexpresses the movement of rubbing. As Kuhn shows, however, this word\nalso possesses the meaning of tearing off, taking away by violence,\nrobbing.[333] As Kuhn points out, this significance is already extant in\nthe Vedic text. The legend of its discovery always expresses the\nproduction of fire as a robbery. (In this far it belongs to the motive\nwidely spread over the earth of the treasure difficult to attain.) The\nfact that in many places and not alone in India the preparation of fire\nis represented as having its origin in robbery, seems to point to a\nwidely spread thought, according to which the preparation of fire was\nsomething forbidden, something usurped or criminal, which could be\nobtained only through stratagem or deeds of violence (mostly through\nstratagem).[334] When onanism confronts the physician as a symptom it\ndoes so frequently under the symbol of secret pilfering, or crafty\nimposition, which always signifies the concealed fulfilment of a\nforbidden wish.[335] Historically, this train of thought probably\nimplies that the ritual preparation of fire was employed with a magic\npurpose, and, therefore, was pursued by official religions; then it\nbecame a ritual mystery,[336] guarded by the priests and surrounded with\nsecrecy. The ritual laws of the Hindoos threaten with severe punishment\nhim who prepares fire in an incorrect manner. The fact alone that\nsomething is mysterious means the same as something done in concealment;\nthat which must remain secret, which one may not see nor do; also\nsomething which is surrounded by severe punishment of body and soul;\ntherefore, presumably, _something forbidden_ which has received a\nlicense as a religious rite. After all has been said about the genesis\nof the preparation of fire, it is no longer difficult to guess what is\nthe forbidden thing; _it is onanism_. When I stated before that it might\nbe lack of satisfaction which breaks up the autoerotic ring of the\ndisplaced sexual activity transferred to the body itself, and thus opens\nwider fields of culture, I did not mention that this loosely closed ring\nof the displaced onanistic activity could be much more firmly closed,\nwhen man makes the other great discovery, that of true onanism.[337]\nWith that the activity is started in the proper place, and this, under\ncertain circumstances, may mean a satisfaction sufficient for a long\ntime, but at the expense of cheating sexuality of its real purpose. It\nis a fraud upon the natural development of things, because all the\ndynamic forces which can and should serve the development of culture are\nwithdrawn from it through onanism, since, instead of the displacement, a\nregression to the local sexual takes place, which is precisely the\nopposite of that which is desirable. Psychologically, however, onanism\nis a discovery of a significance not to be undervalued. One is protected\nfrom fate, since no sexual need then has the power to give one up to\nlife. For with onanism one has the greatest magic in one’s hands; one\nneeds only to phantasy, and with that to masturbate, then one possesses\nall the pleasure of the world, and is no longer compelled to conquer the\nworld of one’s desires through hard labor and wrestling with\nreality.[338] Aladdin rubs his lamp and the obedient genii stand at his\nbidding; thus the fairy tale expresses the great psychologic advantage\nof the easy regression to the local sexual satisfaction. Aladdin’s\nsymbol subtly confirms the ambiguity of the magic fire preparation.\n\nThe close relation of the generation of fire to the onanistic act is\nillustrated by a case, the knowledge of which I owe to Dr. Schmid, in\nCery, that of an imbecile peasant youth who set many incendiary fires.\nAt one of these conflagrations he drew suspicion to himself by his\nbehavior. He stood with his hands in his trouser pockets in the door of\nan opposite house and gazed with apparent delight at the fire. Under\nexamination in the insane asylum, he described the fire in great detail,\nand made suspicious movements in his trouser pockets with his hands. The\nphysical examination undertaken at once showed that he had masturbated.\nLater he confessed that he had masturbated at the time when he had\nenjoyed the fire which he had enkindled himself.\n\nThe preparation of fire in itself is a perfectly ordinary useful custom,\nemployed everywhere for many centuries, which in itself involved nothing\nmore mysterious than eating and drinking. However, there was always a\ntendency from time to time to prepare fire in a ceremonious and\nmysterious manner (exactly as with ritual eating and drinking), which\nwas to be carried out in an exactly prescribed way and from which no one\ndared differ. This mysterious tendency associated with the technique is\nthe second path in the onanistic regression, always present by the side\nof culture. The strict rules applied to it, the zeal of the ceremonial\npreparations and the religious awe of the mysteries next originate from\nthis source; the ceremonial, although apparently irrational, is an\nextremely ingenious institution from the psychologic standpoint, for it\nrepresents a substitute for the possibility of onanistic regression\naccurately circumscribed by law. The law cannot apply to the content of\nthe ceremony, for it is really quite indifferent for the ritual act,\nwhether it is carried out in this way or in that way. On the contrary,\nit is very essential whether the restrained libido is discharged through\na sterile onanism or transposed into the path of sublimation. These\nsevere measures of protection apply primarily to onanism.[339]",
