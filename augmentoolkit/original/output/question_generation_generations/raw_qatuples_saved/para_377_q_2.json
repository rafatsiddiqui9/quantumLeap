    "paragraph": "In the \u201cBook of Rites\u201d it is said:\u201cWood is burned in the flames for the spirit of Au. This sacrifice to  Au is a sacrifice to old departed women.\u201dThese spirits of the hearth and fire are the souls of departed cooks and, therefore, are called \u201cold women.\u201d The kitchen god develops from this pre-Buddhistic tradition and becomes later (male sex) the ruler of the family and the _mediator between family and god_. Thus the old feminine fire spirit becomes a species of Logos. (Compare with this the remarks in Chapter III.)From the bull\u2019s sperma the progenitors of the cattle came, as well as two hundred and seventy-two species of useful animals. According to M\u00een\u00f4khired, Gayomard had destroyed the D\u00e9v Az\u00fbr, who was considered the demon of evil appetites.[831] In spite of the efforts of Zarathustra, this demon remained longest on the earth. He was destroyed at last at the resurrection, like Satan in the Apocalypse of John. In another version it is said that Angromainyus and the serpent were left until the last, so as to be destroyed by Ahuramazda himself. According to a surmise by Kern, Zarathustra may mean \u201cgolden-star\u201d and be identical with Mithra. Mithra\u2019s name is connected with neo-Persian _Mihr_, which means \u201csun and love.\u201dIn Zagreus we see that the bull is also identical with the god; hence the bull sacrifice is a god sacrifice, but on a primitive stage. The animal symbol is, so to speak, only a part of the hero; he sacrifices only his animal; therefore, symbolically, renounces only his animal nature. The internal participation in the sacrifice[832] is expressed excellently in the anguished ecstatic countenance of the bull-slaying Mithra. He does it willingly and unwillingly[833] hence the somewhat hysterical expression which has some similarity to the well-known mawkish countenance of the Crucified of Guido Reni. Benndorf says:[834]",

    "question": "What significant event does M\u00een\u00f4khired attribute to Gayomard, and how does this relate to other religious narratives?\n\n**ANS:** \nM\u00een\u00f4khired attributes the destruction of the D\u00e9v Az\u00fbr, considered the demon of evil appetites, to Gayomard. This demon, known as a source of evil desires, was destroyed at the resurrection, similar to how Satan is destroyed in the Apocalypse of John. Another version suggests that Angromainyus and the serpent were left until the last and were destroyed by Ahuramazda himself.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the significance of the bull in the context of Mithra and Zagreus?",
    "answer": "The bull holds significant symbolic importance in the context of Mithra and Zagreus. According to the text, the bull is also considered a god, making the bull sacrifice a god sacrifice on a primitive stage. The bull symbolizes the hero, and sacrificing the bull involves the symbolic renunciation of the animal nature, reflecting the internal participation in the sacrifice.",
