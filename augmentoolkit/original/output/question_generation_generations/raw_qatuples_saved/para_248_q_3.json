    "paragraph": "\u201cThat which brought me up, is dead and riven,      Dead the youthful world which was my shield;     And this breast, which used to harbor heaven,      Dead and dry as any stubble-field.     Still my Springlike sorrows sing and cover      With their friendly comfort every smart\u2014     But the morning of my life is over      And the Spring has faded from my heart....\u201cShadows are the things that once we cherished;      Love itself must fade and cannot bide;     Since the golden dreams of youth have perished,      Even friendly Nature\u2019s self has died.     Heart, poor heart, those days could never show it\u2014      How far-off thy home, and where it lies ...     Now, alas, thou nevermore wilt know it      If a dream of it does not suffice.\u201d_Palinodia._\u201cWhat gathers about me, Earth, in your dusky, friendly green?   What are you blowing towards me, Winds, what do you bring again?   There is a rustling in all the tree-tops....\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7\u201cWhy do you wake my soul?   Why do ye stir in me the past, ye Kind ones?   Oh, spare me, and let them rest; oh, do not mock   Those ashes of my joy....\u201cO change your changeless gods\u2014   And grow in your youth over the old ones.   And if you would be akin to the mortals   The young girls will blossom for you.   And the young heroes will shine;   And, sweeter than ever,   Morning will play upon the cheeks of the happy ones;   And, ravishing-sweet, you will hear   The songs of those who are without care....\u201cAh, once the living waves of song   Surged out of every bush to me;   And still the heavenly ones glanced down upon me,   Their eyes shining with joy.\u201d\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7",
