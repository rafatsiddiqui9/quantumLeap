    "paragraph": "We know that, although individuals are widely separated by the differences in the contents of their consciousness, they are closely alike in their unconscious psychology. It is a significant impression for one working in practical psychoanalysis when he realizes how uniform are the typical unconscious complexes. Difference first arises from individualization. This fact gives to an essential portion of the Schopenhauer and Hartmann philosophies a deep psychologic justification.[349] The very evident uniformity of the unconscious mechanism serves as a psychologic foundation for these philosophic views. The unconscious contains the differentiated remnants of the earlier psychologic functions overcome by the individual differentiation. The reaction and products of the animal psyche are of a generally diffused uniformity and solidity, which, among men, may be discovered apparently only in traces. Man appears as something extraordinarily individual in contrast with animals.After Miss Miller had concentrated herself again, the vision developed further:\u201cSuddenly an Aztec appeared, absolutely clear in every detail; the  hands spread open, with large fingers, the head in profile, armored,  headdress similar to the feather ornaments of the American Indian. The  whole was somewhat suggestive of Mexican sculpture.\u201d",

    "question": "What kind of evidence does the author use to support the idea of uniformity in the unconscious mechanism?",
    "answer": "The author supports the idea of uniformity in the unconscious mechanism through practical experiences in psychoanalysis, noting the realization of the uniformity of typical unconscious complexes. Additionally, the author provides a specific example from a vision of an Aztec figure to illustrate this uniformity, showing how detailed and clear images can emerge from the unconscious, indicating a level of uniformity and solidity that is not easily apparent in everyday human behavior.",
