    "paragraph": "anxiety attributes, are the symbolic representations of anxiety which correspond to the repressed incest wish. It is, therefore, intelligible, when we come across the tree with the snake again and again (in Paradise the snake even tempts to sin). The snake or dragon possesses in particular the meaning of treasure guardian and defender. The phallic, as well as the feminine, meaning of the dragon[542] indicates that it is again a symbol of the sexual neutral (or bisexual) libido, that is to say, a symbol of the _libido in opposition_. In this significance the black horse, Apaosha, the demon of opposition, appears in the old Persian song, Tishtriya, where it obstructs the sources of the rain lake. The white horse Tishtriya makes two futile attempts to vanquish Apaosha; at the third attempt, with the help of Ahuramazda, he is successful.[543] Whereupon the sluices of heaven open and a fruitful rain pours down upon the earth.[544] In this song one sees very beautifully in the choice of symbol how libido is opposed to libido, will against will, the discordance of primitive man with himself, which he recognizes again in all the adversity and contrasts of external nature.",

    "question": "How does the story of Tishtriya and Apaosha reflect the internal conflicts of primitive man?",
    "answer": "The story of Tishtriya and Apaosha reflects the internal conflicts of primitive man by illustrating the discordance between opposing forces within his psyche. Tishtriya\u2019s three attempts to vanquish Apaosha symbolize the ongoing struggle between constructive and obstructive aspects of libido. The successful resolution of this conflict, with the help of a higher authority, symbolizes the triumph over inner adversity and the achievement of harmony, which in this context is represented by a fruitful rain pouring down upon the earth. This narrative beautifully captures the recognition of internal conflicts and the balance needed to overcome them.",
