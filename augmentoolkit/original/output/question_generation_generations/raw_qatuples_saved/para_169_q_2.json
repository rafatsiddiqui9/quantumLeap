    "paragraph": "We spoke of the ontogenetic re-echo of the phylogenetic psychology among children, we saw that phantastic thinking is a characteristic of antiquity, of the child, and of the lower races; but now we know also that our modern and adult man is given over in large part to this same phantastic thinking, which enters as soon as the directed thinking ceases. A lessening of the interest, a slight fatigue, is sufficient to put an end to the directed thinking, the exact psychological adaptation to the real world, and to replace it with phantasies. We digress from the theme and give way to our own trains of thought; if the slackening of the attention increases, then we lose by degrees the consciousness of the present, and the phantasy enters into possession of the field.",

    "question": "Under what conditions does phantastic thinking become more prominent according to the text?",
    "answer": "Phantastic thinking becomes more prominent when directed thinking ceases. This can happen due to a decrease in interest, slight fatigue, or a relaxation of attention. When directed thinking stops, the mind shifts to phantasies, often leading to a loss of consciousness of the present moment.",
