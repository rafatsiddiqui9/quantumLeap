    "paragraph": "It is easy to understand the maiden as a symbol of the libido used in the sense of causative comparison. The snake in Paradise is usually considered as feminine, as the seductive principle in woman, and is represented as feminine by the old artists, although properly the snake has a phallic meaning. Through a similar change of meaning the snake in antiquity becomes the symbol of the earth, which on its side is always considered feminine. The bull is the well-known symbol for the fruitfulness of the sun. The bull gods in the Mithraic liturgy were called \u03ba\u03bd\u03c9\u03b8\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2, \u201cguardians of the axis of the earth,\u201d by whom the axle of the orb of the heavens was turned. The divine man, Mithra, also had the same attributes; he is sometimes called the \u201cSol invictus\u201d itself, sometimes the mighty companion and ruler of Helios; he holds in his right hand the \u201cbear constellation, which moves and turns the heavens.\u201d The bull-headed gods, equally \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f04\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03b9 with Mithra himself, to whom the attribute \u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u201cyoung one,\u201d \u201cthe newcomer,\u201d is given, are merely attributive components of the same divinity. The chief god of the Mithraic liturgy is himself subdivided into Mithra and Helios; the attributes of each of these are closely related to the other. Of Helios it is said: \u1f44\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03bd \u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u1fc6 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03b1 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c7\u03b9\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b9 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c7\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u1fc3, \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd.[160]Of Mithra it is said: \u1f44\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7, \u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03bd, \u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd, \u1f10\u03bd \u03c7\u03b9\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b9 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u1ff3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u1ff3 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u1ff3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03be\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u1fb7 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f66\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f45\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f21 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f65\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1. \u1f14\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1 \u1f44\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f40\u03bc\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u1f70\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f01\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2.[161]",
