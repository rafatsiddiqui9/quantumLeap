    "paragraph": "It is probable that this oropic well is also the place of his \u201cKatabasis\u201d (descent into the lower world). There were many entrances into Hades in antiquity. Thus near Eleusis there was an abyss, through which Aidoneus passed up and down, when he kidnapped Cora. (Dragon and maiden: the libido overcome by resistance, life replaced by death.) There were crevices in the rocks, through which souls could ascend to the upper world. Behind the temple of Chthonia in Hermione lay a sacred district of Pluto, with a ravine through which Hercules had brought up Cerberus; in addition, there was an \u201cAcherusian\u201d lake.[710] This ravine was, therefore, the entrance to the place where death was conquered. The lake also belongs here as a further mother symbol, for symbols appear massed together, as they are surrogates, and, therefore, do not afford the same satisfaction of desire as accorded by reality, so that the unsatisfied remnant of the libido must seek still further symbolic outlets. The ravine in the Areopagus in Athens was considered the seat of inhabitants of the lower world. An old Grecian custom[711] suggests a similar idea. Girls were sent into a cavern, where a poisonous snake dwelt, as a test of virginity. If they were bitten by the snake, it was a token that they were no longer chaste. We find this same motive again in the Roman legend of St. Silvester, at the end of the fifth century:[712]",

    "question": "What are some historical entrances to the underworld mentioned in the text, and what symbolism do they represent?",
    "answer": "The text mentions several entrances to the underworld in ancient Greece. Near Eleusis, there was an abyss through which Aidoneus passed up and down when he kidnapped Cora, symbolizing the libido overcome by resistance and life replaced by death. Other entrances included crevices in rocks through which souls could ascend to the upper world. Near the temple of Chthonia in Hermione, there was a sacred district of Pluto with a ravine where Hercules brought up Cerberus, symbolizing the entrance to the place where death was conquered. Additionally, there was an \"Acherusian\" lake, a mother symbol representing unsatisfied desire seeking further symbolic outlets. The ravine in the Areopagus in Athens was also considered the seat of inhabitants of the lower world.",
