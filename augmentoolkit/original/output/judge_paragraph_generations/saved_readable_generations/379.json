{"paragraph": "explanation. It is to be mentioned that Loki generates in the form of a horse, just as does the devil when in horse\u2019s form, as an old fire god. Thus the lightning was represented theriomorphically as a horse.[581] An uneducated hysteric told me that as a child she had suffered from extreme fear of thunder, because every time the lightning flashed she saw immediately afterwards a huge black horse reaching upwards as far as the sky.[582] It is said in a legend that the devil, as the divinity of lightning, casts a horse\u2019s foot (lightning) upon the roofs. In accordance with the primitive meaning of thunder as fertilizer of the earth, the phallic meaning is given both to lightning and the horse\u2019s foot. In mythology the horse\u2019s foot really has the phallic function as in this dream. An uneducated patient who originally had been violently forced to coitus by her husband very often dreams (after separation) that a wild horse springs upon her and kicks her in the abdomen with his hind foot.
