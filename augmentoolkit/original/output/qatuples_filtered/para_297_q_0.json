    "paragraph": "It is difficult to be a saint, because even a patient and long-suffering nature will not readily bear such a violation, and defends itself in its own way. The companion of sanctity is temptation, without which no true saint can live. We know from analytic experience that these temptations can pass unconsciously, so that only their equivalents would be produced in consciousness in the form of symptoms. We know that it is proverbial that heart and smart (Herz and Schmerz) rhyme. It is a well-known fact that hysterics put a physical pain in place of a mental pain. The biographer of Emmerich has comprehended that very correctly. Only her interpretation of the pain is, as usual, projected. It is always the others who secretly assert all sorts of evil things about her, and this she pretended gave her the pains.[601] The case, however, bears a somewhat different aspect. The very difficult renunciation of all life\u2019s joys, this death before the bloom, is generally painful, and especially painful are the unfulfilled wishes and the attempts of the animal nature to break through the power of repression. The gossip and jokes of the sisters very naturally centre around these most painful things, so that it must appear to the saint as if her symptoms were caused by this. Naturally, again, she could not know that gossip tends to assume the r\u00f4le of the unconscious, which, like a clever adversary, always aims at the actual gaps in our armor.A passage from Gautama Buddha embodies this idea:[602]\u201cA wish earnestly desired          Produced by will, and nourished          When gradually it must be thwarted,          Burrows like an arrow in the flesh.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the author suggest about the relationship between sanctity and temptation?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that temptation is an essential companion to sanctity, and no true saint can live without facing it. Even a patient and long-suffering nature will defend itself when violated, and these defenses manifest as forms of temptation.",
