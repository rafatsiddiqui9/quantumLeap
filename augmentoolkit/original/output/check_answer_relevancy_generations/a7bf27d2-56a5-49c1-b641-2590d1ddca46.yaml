    phantasy, depict, as is natural, those traits of character which belong to the
    author. The hero, the wish figure, is represented as most distinguished, because
    the hero always combines in himself all wished-for ideals. Cyrano’s attitude is
    certainly beautiful and impressive; Cassius’s behavior has a theatrical effect.
    Both heroes prepare to die effectively, in which attempt Cyrano succeeds. This
    attitude betrays a wish for death in the unconscious of our author, the meaning
    of which we have already discussed at length as the motive for her poem of the
    moth. The wish of young girls to die is only an indirect expression, which remains
    a pose, even in case of real death, for death itself can be a pose. Such an outcome
    merely adds beauty and value to the pose under certain conditions. That the highest
    summit of life is expressed through the symbolism of death is a well-known fact;
    for creation beyond one’s self means personal death. The coming generation is
    the end of the preceding one. This symbolism is frequent in erotic speech. The
    lascivious speech between Lucius and the wanton servant-maid in Apuleius (“Metamorphoses,”
    lib. ii: 32) is one of the clearest examples:“Proeliare, inquit, et fortiter proeliare:
