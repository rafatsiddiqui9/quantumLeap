    "paragraph": "We know, from our own experience, this state of mind. It is an infantile stage. To a child the moon is a man or a face or a shepherd of the stars. The clouds in the sky seem like little sheep; the dolls drink, eat and sleep; the child places a letter at the window for the Christ-child; he calls to the stork to bring him a little brother or sister; the cow is the wife of the horse, and the dog the husband of the cat. We know, too, that lower races, like the negroes, look upon the locomotive as an animal, and call the drawers of the table the child of the table.",

    "question": "In what ways might the attribution of human traits to non-human entities affect our interactions with the world?",
    "answer": "Attributing human traits to non-human entities can affect our interactions with the world by influencing our emotional and sensory responses. For example, viewing a locomotive as an animal might make us more empathetic towards it, potentially leading to behaviors like treating it with care or concern. This can also affect our decision-making and attitudes towards technology and nature.",
