By means of his\ndialogue with the bird (bird, like wind and arrow, represents the wish,\nthe winged longing) Siegfried entices Fafner from the cave. His desires\nturn back to the mother, and the chthonic demon, the cave-dwelling\nterror of the woods, appears. Fafner is the protector of the treasure;\nin his cave lies the hoard, the source of life and power. The mother\npossesses the libido of the son, and jealously does she guard it.\nTranslated into psychological language, this means the positive\ntransference succeeds only through the release of the libido from the\nmother-imago, the incestuous object in general. Only in this manner is\nit possible to gain one’s libido, the incomparable treasure, and this\nrequires a mighty struggle, the whole battle of adaptation.[705] The\nSiegfried legend has abundantly described the outcome of this battle\nwith Fafner. According to the Edda, Siegfried eats Fafner’s heart, the\nseat of life. He wins the magic cap, through whose power Alberich had\nchanged himself into a serpent. This refers to the motive of casting the\nskin, rejuvenation. By means of the magic cap one can vanish and assume\ndifferent shapes. The vanishing probably refers to dying and to the\ninvisible presence; that is, existence in the mother’s womb. A\nluck-bringing cap, amniotic covering, the new-born child occasionally\nwears over his head (the caul). Moreover, Siegfried drinks the dragon’s\nblood, which makes it possible for him to understand the language of\nbirds, and consequently he enters into a peculiar relation with Nature,\na dominating position, the result of his knowledge, and finally wins the\ntreasure.\n\n_Hort_ is a mediæval and Old High German word with the meaning of\n“collected and guarded treasure”; Gothic, _huzd_; Old Scandinavian,\n_hodd_; Germanic _hozda_, from pre-Germanic _kuzdhó_—for _kudtho_—“the\nconcealed.” Kluge[706] adds to this the Greek κεύθω, έκυθον = “to hide,\nto conceal.” Also _hut_ (_hut_, to guard; English, hide), Germanic root\n_hud_, from Indo-Germanic _kuth_ (questionable), to Greek κεύθω and\nκύσθος, “cavity,” feminine genitals. Prellwitz,[707] too, traces Gothic\n_huzd_, Anglo-Saxon _hyde_, English hide and hoard, to Greek κεύθω.\nWhitley Stokes traces English hide, Anglo-Saxon _hydan_, New High German\n_Hütte_, Latin _cûdo_ = helmet; Sanskrit _kuhara_ (cave?) to primitive\nCeltic _koudo_ = concealment; Latin, _occultatio_.\n\nThe assumption of Kluge is also supported in other directions; namely,\nfrom the point of view of the primitive idea:\n\n  “There exists in Athens[708] a sacred place (a Temenos) of Ge, with\n  the surname Olympia. Here the ground is torn open for about a yard in\n  width; and they say, after the flood at the time of Deucalion, that\n  the water receded here; and every year they throw into the fissure\n  wheatmeal, kneaded with honey.”\n\nWe have observed previously that among the Arrhetophorian, pastry in the\nform of snakes and phalli, was thrown into a crevice in the earth. This\nwas mentioned in connection with the ceremonies of fertilizing the\nearth. We have touched slightly already upon the sacrifice in the earth\ncrevice among the Watschandies. The flood of death has passed\ncharacteristically into the crevice of the earth; that is, back into the\nmother again; because from the mother the universal great death has come\nin the first place. The flood is simply the counterpart of the vivifying\nand all-producing water: Ὠκεανοῦ, ὅσπερ γένεσις πάντεσσι τέτυκται.[709]\nOne sacrifices the honey cake to the mother, so that she may spare one\nfrom death. Thus every year in Rome a gold sacrifice was thrown into the\nlacus Curtius, into the former fissure in the earth, which could only be\nclosed through the sacrificial death of Curtius. He was the typical\nhero, who has journeyed into the underworld, in order to conquer the\ndanger threatening the Roman state from the opening of the abyss.\n(Kaineus, Amphiaraos.) In the Amphiaraion of Oropos those healed through\nthe temple incubation threw their gifts of gold into the sacred well, of\nwhich Pausanias says:\n\n  “If any one is healed of a sickness through a saying of the oracle,\n  then it is customary to throw a silver or gold coin into the well;\n  because here Amphiaraos has ascended as a god.”\n\nIt is probable that this oropic well is also the place of his\n“Katabasis” (descent into the lower world). There were many entrances\ninto Hades in antiquity. Thus near Eleusis there was an abyss, through\nwhich Aidoneus passed up and down, when he kidnapped Cora. (Dragon and\nmaiden: the libido overcome by resistance, life replaced by death.)\nThere were crevices in the rocks, through which souls could ascend to\nthe upper world. Behind the temple of Chthonia in Hermione lay a sacred\ndistrict of Pluto, with a ravine through which Hercules had brought up\nCerberus; in addition, there was an “Acherusian” lake.[710] This ravine\nwas, therefore, the entrance to the place where death was conquered. The\nlake also belongs here as a further mother symbol, for symbols appear\nmassed together, as they are surrogates, and, therefore, do not afford\nthe same satisfaction of desire as accorded by reality, so that the\nunsatisfied remnant of the libido must seek still further symbolic\noutlets. The ravine in the Areopagus in Athens was considered the seat\nof inhabitants of the lower world. An old Grecian custom[711] suggests a\nsimilar idea. Girls were sent into a cavern, where a poisonous snake\ndwelt, as a test of virginity. If they were bitten by the snake, it was\na token that they were no longer chaste. We find this same motive again\nin the Roman legend of St. Silvester, at the end of the fifth\ncentury:[712]\n\n  “Erat draco immanissimus in monte Tarpeio, in quo est Capitolium\n  collocatum. Ad hunc draconem per CCCLXV gradus, quasi ad infernum,\n  magi cum virginibus sacrilegis descendebant semel in mense cum\n  sacrificiis et lustris, ex quibus esca poterat tanto draconi inferri.\n  Hic draco subito ex improviso ascendebat et licet non ingrederetur\n  vicinos tamen aeres flatu suo vitiabat. Ex quo mortalitas hominum et\n  maxima luctus de morte veniebat infantum. (Lilith motive.) Sanctus\n  itaque Silvester cum haberet cum paganis pro defensione veritatis\n  conflictum, ad hoc venit ut dicerent ei pagani: ‘Silvester descende ad\n  draconem et fac eum in nomine Dei tui vel uno anno ab interfectione\n  generis humani cessare.’”[713]\n\nSt. Peter appeared to Silvester in a dream and advised him to close his\ndoor to the underworld with chains, according to the model in\nRevelation, chap, xx:\n\n  (1) “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the\n  bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand.\n\n  (2) “And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the\n  Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.\n\n  (3) “And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a\n  seal upon him.”\n\nThe anonymous author of a writing, “De Promissionibus,”[714] of the\nbeginning of the fifth century, mentions a very similar legend:\n\n  “Apud urbem Romam specus quidam fuit in quo draco miræ magnitudinis\n  mechanica arte formatus, gladium ore gestans,[715] oculis rutilantibus\n  gemmis[716] metuendus ac terribilis apparebat. Hinc annuæ devotæ\n  virgines floribus exornatæ, eo modo in sacrificio dabantur, quatenus\n  inscias munera deferentes gradum scalæ, quo certe ille arte diaboli\n  draco pendebat, contingentes impetus venientis gladii perimeret, ut\n  sanguinem funderet innocentem. Et hunc quidam monachus, bene ob\n  meritum cognitus Stiliconi tunc patricio, eo modo subvertit; baculo,\n  manu, singulos gradus palpandos inspiciens, statim ut illum tangens\n  fraudem diabolicam repperit, eo transgresso descendens, draconem\n  scidit, misitque in partes: ostendens et hie deos non esse qui manu\n  fiunt.”[717]\n\nThe _hero battling with the dragon has much in common with the dragon_,\nand also he takes over his qualities; for example, invulnerability. As\nthe footnotes show, the similarity is carried still further (sparkling\neyes, sword in his mouth). Translated psychologically, the dragon is\nmerely the son’s repressed longing, striving towards the mother;\ntherefore, the son is the dragon, as even Christ is identified with the\nserpent, which, once upon a time, similia similibus, had controlled the\nsnake plague in the Wilderness. John iii: 14. _As a serpent he is to be\ncrucified; that is to say, as one striving backwards towards the mother,\nhe must die hanging or suspended on the mother tree._ Christ and the\ndragon of the Antichrist are in the closest contact in the history of\ntheir appearance and their cosmic meaning. (Compare Bousset, the\nAntichrist.) The legend of the dragon concealed in the Antichrist myth\nbelongs to the life of the hero, and, therefore, is immortal. In none of\nthe newer forms of myth are the pairs of opposites so perceptibly near\nas in that of Christ and Antichrist. (I refer to the remarkable\npsychologic description of this problem in Mereschkowski’s romance,\n“Leonardo da Vinci.”) That the dragon is only an artifice is a useful\nand delightfully rationalistic conceit, which is most significant for\nthat period. In this way the dismal gods were effectually vulgarized.\nThe schizophrenic insane readily make use of this mechanism, in order to\ndepreciate efficient personalities. One often hears the stereotyped\nlament, “It is all a play, artificial, made up,” etc. A dream of a\n“schizophrenic” is most significant; he is sitting in a dark room, which\nhas only a single small window, through which he can see the sky. The\nsun and moon appear, but they are only made artificially from oil paper.\n(Denial of the deleterious incest influence.)\n\nThe descent of the three hundred and sixty-five steps refers to the\nsun’s course, to the cavern of death and rebirth. That this cavern\nactually stands in a relation to the subterranean mother of death can be\nshown by a note in Malalas, the historian of Antioch,[718] who relates\nthat Diocletian consecrated there a crypt to Hecate, to which one\ndescends by three hundred and sixty-five steps. Cave mysteries seem to\nhave been celebrated for Hecate in Samothrace as well. The serpent also\nplayed a great part as a regular symbolic attribute in the service of\nHecate. The mysteries of Hecate flourished in Rome towards the end of\nthe fourth century, so that the two foregoing legends might indeed\nrelate to her cult. Hecate[719] is a real spectral goddess of night and\nphantoms, a Mar; she is represented as riding, and in Hesiod occurs as\nthe _patron_ of riders. She sends the horrible nocturnal fear phantom,\nthe Empusa, of whom Aristophanes says that she appears inclosed in a\n_bladder swollen with blood_. According to Libanius, the mother of\nAischines is also called Empusa, for the reason that “ἐκ σκοτεινῶν τόπων\nτοῖς παισὶν καὶ ταῖς γυναιξίν ὡρμᾶτο.”[720]",
