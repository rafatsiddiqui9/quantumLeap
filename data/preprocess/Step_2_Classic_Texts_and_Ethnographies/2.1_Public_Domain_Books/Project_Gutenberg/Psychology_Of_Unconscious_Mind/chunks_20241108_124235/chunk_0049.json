We come across in the Mithraic religion, a strange God of\nTime, Aion, called Kronos or Deus Leontocephalus, because his\nstereotyped representation is a lion-headed man, who, standing in a\nrigid attitude, is encoiled by a snake, whose head projects forward from\nbehind over the lion’s head. The figure holds in each hand a key, on the\nchest rests a thunderbolt, upon his back are the four wings of the wind;\nin addition to that, the figure sometimes bears the Zodiac on his body.\nAdditional attributes are a cock and implements. In the Carolingian\npsalter of Utrecht, which is based upon ancient models, the Sæculum-Aion\nis represented as a naked man with a snake in his hand. As is suggested\nby the name of the divinity, he is a symbol of time, most interestingly\ncomposed from libido symbols. The lion, the zodiac sign of the greatest\nsummer heat,[591] is the symbol of the most mighty desire. (“My soul\nroars with the voice of a hungry lion,” says Mechthild of Magdeburg.) In\nthe Mithra mystery the serpent is often antagonistic to the lion,\ncorresponding to that very universal myth of the battle of the sun with\nthe dragon.\n\nIn the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Tum is even designated as a he-cat,\nbecause as such he fought the snake, Apophis. The encoiling also means\nthe engulfing, the entering into the mother’s womb. Thus time is defined\nby the rising and setting of the sun, that is to say, through the death\nand renewal of the libido. The addition of the cock again suggests time,\nand the addition of implements suggests the creation through time.\n(“Durée créatrice,” Bergson.) Oromazdes and Ahriman were produced\nthrough Zrwanakarana, the “infinitely long duration.” Time, this empty\nand purely formal concept, is expressed in the mysteries by\ntransformations of the creative power, the libido. Macrobius says:\n\n  “Leonis capite monstratur praesens tempus—quia conditio ejus valida\n  fervensque est.”[592]\n\nPhilo of Alexandria has a better understanding:\n\n  “Tempus ab hominibus pessimis putatur deus volentibus Ens essentiale\n  abscondere—pravis hominibus tempus putatur causa rerum mundi,\n  sapientibus vero et optimis non tempus sed Deus.”[593][594]\n\nIn Firdusi[595] time is often the symbol of fate, the libido nature of\nwhich we have already learned to recognize. The Hindoo text mentioned\nabove includes still more—its symbol of the horse contains the whole\nworld; his kinsman and his cradle is the sea, the mother, similar to the\nworld soul, the maternal significance of which we have seen above. Just\nas Aion represents the libido in an embrace, that is to say, in the\nstate of death and of rebirth, so here the cradle of the horse is the\nsea, i. e. the libido is in the mother, dying and rising again, like the\nsymbol of the dying and resurrected Christ, who hangs like ripe fruit\nupon the tree of life.\n\nWe have already seen that the horse is connected through Ygdrasil with\nthe symbolism of the tree. The horse is also a “tree of death”; thus in\nthe Middle Ages the funeral pyre was called St. Michael’s horse, and the\nneo-Persian word for coffin means “wooden horse.”[596] The horse has\nalso the rôle of psycho-pompos; he is the steed to conduct the souls to\nthe other world—horsewomen fetch the souls (Valkyries). Neo-Greek songs\nrepresent Charon on a horse. These definitions obviously lead to the\nmother symbolism. The Trojan horse was the only means by which the city\ncould be conquered; because only he who has entered the mother and been\nreborn is an invincible hero. The Trojan horse is a magic charm, like\nthe “Nodfyr,” which also serves to overcome necessity. The formula\nevidently reads, “In order to overcome the difficulty, thou must commit\nincest, and once more be born from thy mother.” It appears that striking\na nail into the sacred tree signifies something very similar. The “Stock\nim Eisen” in Vienna seems to have been such a palladium.\n\nStill another symbolic form is to be considered. Occasionally the devil\nrides upon a three-legged horse. The Goddess of Death, Hel, in time of\npestilence, also rides upon a three-legged horse.[597] The gigantic ass,\nwhich is three-legged, stands in the heavenly rain lake Vourukasha; his\nurine purifies the water of the lake, and from his roar all useful\nanimals become pregnant and all harmful animals miscarry. The Triad\nfurther points to the phallic significance. The contrasting symbolism of\nHel is blended into one conception in the ass of Vourukasha. The libido\nis fructifying as well as destroying.\n\nThese definitions, as a whole, plainly reveal the fundamental features.\nThe horse is a libido symbol, partly of phallic, partly of maternal\nsignificance, like the tree. It represents the libido in this\napplication, that is, the libido repressed through the incest\nprohibition.\n\nIn the Miller drama an Indian approaches the hero, ready to shoot an\narrow at him. Chiwantopel, however, with a proud gesture, exposes his\nbreast to the enemy. This idea reminds the author of the scene between\nCassius and Brutus in Shakespeare’s “Julius Cæsar.” A misunderstanding\nhas arisen between the two friends, when Brutus reproaches Cassius for\nwithholding from him the money for the legions. Cassius, irritable and\nangry, breaks out into the complaint:\n\n        “Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\n        Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\n        For Cassius is a-weary of the world:\n        Hated by one he loves: braved by his brother:\n        Check’d like a bondman; _all his faults observed_:\n        Set in a note-book, learn’d and conn’d by rote,\n        To cast into my teeth. O I could weep\n        My spirit from mine eyes!—There is my dagger,\n        And here my naked breast; within, a heart\n        Dearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold:\n        If that thou beest a Roman, take it forth:\n        I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.\n        Strike, as thou didst at Cæsar; for I know\n        When thou didst hate him worst, thou lov’dst him better\n        Than ever thou lov’dst Cassius.”\n\nThe material here would be incomplete without mentioning the fact that\nthis speech of Cassius shows many analogies to the agonized delirium of\nCyrano (compare Part I), only Cassius is far more theatrical and\noverdrawn. Something childish and hysterical is in his manner. Brutus\ndoes not think of killing him, but administers a very chilling rebuke in\nthe following dialogue:\n\n     BRUTUS: Sheathe your dagger:\n             Be angry when you will, it shall have scope:\n             Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.\n             _O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb_\n             That carries anger as the flint bears fire:\n             Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\n             And straight is cold again.\n\n     CASSIUS:                            Hath Cassius liv’d\n             To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus\n             When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?\n\n     BRUTUS: When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.\n\n     CASSIUS: Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.\n\n     BRUTUS: And my heart too.\n\n     CASSIUS:                  O Brutus!\n\n     BRUTUS:                             What’s the matter?\n\n     CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me\n              When that rash humor _which my mother gave me_\n              Makes me forgetful?\n\n     BRUTUS:                      Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth\n              When you are over earnest with your Brutus,\n              He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.\n\nThe analytic interpretation of Cassius’s irritability plainly reveals\nthat at these moments he identifies himself with the mother, and his\nconduct, therefore, is truly feminine, as his speech demonstrates most\nexcellently. For his womanish love-seeking and desperate subjection\nunder the proud masculine will of Brutus calls forth the friendly remark\nof the latter, that Cassius is yoked with a lamb, that is to say, has\nsomething very weak in his character, which is derived from the mother.\nOne recognizes in this without any difficulty the analytic hall-marks of\nan infantile disposition, which, as always, is characterized by a\nprevalence of the parent-imago, here the mother-imago. An infantile\nindividual is infantile because he has freed himself insufficiently, or\nnot at all, from the childish environment, that is, from his adaptation\nto his parents. Therefore, on one side, he reacts falsely towards the\nworld, as a child towards his parents, always demanding love and\nimmediate reward for his feelings; on the other side, on account of the\nclose connection to the parents, he identifies himself with them. The\ninfantile individual behaves like the father and mother. He is not in a\ncondition to live for himself and to find the place to which he belongs.\nTherefore, Brutus very justly takes it for granted that the “mother\nchides” in Cassius, not he himself. The psychologically valuable fact\nwhich we gather here is the information _that Cassius is infantile and\nidentified_ with the mother. The hysterical behavior is due to the\ncircumstance that Cassius is still, in part, a lamb, and _an innocent\nand entirely harmless child_. He remains, as far as his emotional life\nis concerned, still far behind himself. This we often see among people\nwho, as masters, apparently govern life and fellow-creatures; they have\nremained children in regard to the demands of their love nature.\n\nThe figures of the Miller dramas, being children of the creator’s\nphantasy, depict, as is natural, those traits of character which belong\nto the author. The hero, the wish figure, is represented as most\ndistinguished, because the hero always combines in himself all\nwished-for ideals. Cyrano’s attitude is certainly beautiful and\nimpressive; Cassius’s behavior has a theatrical effect. Both heroes\nprepare to die effectively, in which attempt Cyrano succeeds. This\nattitude betrays a wish for death in the unconscious of our author, the\nmeaning of which we have already discussed at length as the motive for\nher poem of the moth. The wish of young girls to die is only an indirect\nexpression, which remains a pose, even in case of real death, for death\nitself can be a pose. Such an outcome merely adds beauty and value to\nthe pose under certain conditions. That the highest summit of life is\nexpressed through the symbolism of death is a well-known fact; for\ncreation beyond one’s self means personal death. The coming generation\nis the end of the preceding one. This symbolism is frequent in erotic\nspeech. The lascivious speech between Lucius and the wanton servant-maid\nin Apuleius (“Metamorphoses,” lib. ii: 32) is one of the clearest\nexamples:\n\n  “Proeliare, inquit, et fortiter proeliare: nec enim tibi cedam, nec\n  terga vortam. Cominus in aspectum, si vir es, dirige; et grassare\n  naviter, et occide moriturus. Hodierna pugna non habet\n  missionem.—Simul ambo corruimus inter mutuos amplexus animas\n  anhelantes.”[598]\n\nThis symbolism is extremely significant, because it shows how easily a\ncontrasting expression originates and how equally intelligible and\ncharacteristic such an expression is. The proud gesture with which the\nhero offers himself to death may very easily be an indirect expression\nwhich challenges the pity or sympathy of the other, and thus is doomed\nto the calm analytic reduction to which Brutus proceeds. The behavior of\nChiwantopel is also suspicious, because the Cassius scene which serves\nas its model betrays indiscreetly that the whole affair is merely\ninfantile and one which owes its origin to an overactive mother imago.\nWhen we compare this piece with the series of mother symbols brought to\nlight in the previous chapter, we must say that the Cassius scene merely\nconfirms once more what we have long supposed, that is to say, that the\nmotor power of these symbolic visions arises from an infantile mother\ntransference, that is to say, from an undetached bond to the mother.",
