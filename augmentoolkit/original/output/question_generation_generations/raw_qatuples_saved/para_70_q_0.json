    "paragraph": "The _hero battling with the dragon has much in common with the dragon_, and also he takes over his qualities; for example, invulnerability. As the footnotes show, the similarity is carried still further (sparkling eyes, sword in his mouth). Translated psychologically, the dragon is merely the son\u2019s repressed longing, striving towards the mother; therefore, the son is the dragon, as even Christ is identified with the serpent, which, once upon a time, similia similibus, had controlled the snake plague in the Wilderness. John iii: 14. _As a serpent he is to be crucified; that is to say, as one striving backwards towards the mother, he must die hanging or suspended on the mother tree._ Christ and the dragon of the Antichrist are in the closest contact in the history of their appearance and their cosmic meaning. (Compare Bousset, the Antichrist.) The legend of the dragon concealed in the Antichrist myth belongs to the life of the hero, and, therefore, is immortal. In none of the newer forms of myth are the pairs of opposites so perceptibly near as in that of Christ and Antichrist. (I refer to the remarkable psychologic description of this problem in Mereschkowski\u2019s romance, \u201cLeonardo da Vinci.\u201d) That the dragon is only an artifice is a useful and delightfully rationalistic conceit, which is most significant for that period. In this way the dismal gods were effectually vulgarized. The schizophrenic insane readily make use of this mechanism, in order to depreciate efficient personalities. One often hears the stereotyped lament, \u201cIt is all a play, artificial, made up,\u201d etc. A dream of a \u201cschizophrenic\u201d is most significant; he is sitting in a dark room, which has only a single small window, through which he can see the sky. The sun and moon appear, but they are only made artificially from oil paper. (Denial of the deleterious incest influence.)",

    "question": "What does the author suggest about the hero battling with the dragon in psychological terms?",
    "answer": "The author suggests that the hero battling with the dragon has much in common with the dragon and takes over its qualities, such as invulnerability. Psychologically, the dragon is seen as the son's repressed longing, striving towards the mother. Therefore, the son is the dragon, and this concept is even paralleled with Christ being identified with the serpent, which once controlled the snake plague in the Wilderness.",
