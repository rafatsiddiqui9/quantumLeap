  "original_text": "The ancient pre-Asiatic civilizations were acquainted with a sun-worship\nhaving the idea of a God dying and rising again (Osiris, Tammuz,\nAttis-Adonis),[186] Christ, Mithra and his bull,[187] Phœnix and so on.\nThe beneficent power as well as the destroying power was worshipped in\nfire. The forces of nature always have two sides, as we have already\nseen in the God of Job. This reciprocal bond brings us back once more to\nMiss Miller’s poem. Her reminiscences support our previous supposition,\nthat the symbol of moth and sun is a condensation of two ideas, about\none of which we have just spoken; the other is the moth and the flame.\nAs the title of a play, about the contents of which the author tells us\nabsolutely nothing, “Moth and Flame” may easily have the well-known\nerotic meaning of flying around the flame of passion until one’s wings\nare burned. The passionate longing, that is to say, the libido, has its\ntwo sides; it is power which beautifies everything, and which under\nother circumstances destroys everything. It often appears as if one\ncould not accurately understand in what the destroying quality of the\ncreative power consists. A woman who gives herself up to passion,\nparticularly under the present-day condition of culture, experiences the\ndestructive side only too soon. One has only to imagine one’s self a\nlittle away from the every-day moral conditions in order to understand\nwhat feelings of extreme insecurity overwhelm the individual who gives\nhimself unconditionally over to Fate.\n\nTo be fruitful means, indeed, to destroy one’s self, because with the\nrise of the succeeding generation the previous one has passed beyond its\nhighest point; thus our descendants are our most dangerous enemies, whom\nwe cannot overcome, for they will outlive us, and, therefore, without\nfail, will take the power from our enfeebled hands. The anxiety in the\nface of the erotic fate is wholly understandable, for there is something\nimmeasurable therein. Fate usually hides unknown dangers, and the\nperpetual hesitation of the neurotic to venture upon life is easily\nexplained by his desire to be allowed to stand still, so as not to take\npart in the dangerous battle of life.[188] _Whoever renounces the chance\nto experience must stifle in himself the wish for it, and, therefore,\ncommits a sort of self-murder._ From this the death phantasies which\nreadily accompany the renunciation of the erotic wish are made clear. In\nthe poem _Miss Miller has voiced these phantasies_.\n\nShe adds further to the material with the following:\n\n  “I had been reading a selection from one of Byron’s poems which\n  pleased me very much and made a deep and lasting impression. Moreover,\n  the rhythm of my last two verses, ‘For I the source, etc.,’ and the\n  two lines of Byron’s are very similar.\n\n             ‘Now let me die as I have lived in faith,\n             Nor tremble though the universe should quake.’”\n\nThis reminiscence with which the series of ideas is closed confirms the\ndeath phantasies which follow from renunciation of the erotic wish. The\nquotation comes—which Miss Miller did not mention—from an uncompleted\npoem of Byron’s called “Heaven and Earth.”[189] The whole verse follows:\n\n               “Still blessed be the Lord,\n               For what is passed,\n               For that which is;\n               For all are His,\n               From first to last—\n               Time—Space—Eternity—Life—Death—\n               The vast known and immeasurable unknown\n               He made and can unmake,\n               And shall I for a little gasp of breath\n               Blaspheme and groan?\n               No, let me die as I have lived in faith,\n               Nor quiver though the universe may quake!”\n\nThe words are included in a kind of praise or prayer, spoken by a\n“mortal” who is in hopeless flight before the mounting deluge. Miss\nMiller puts herself in the same situation in her quotation; that is to\nsay, she readily lets it be seen that her feeling is similar to the\ndespondency of the unhappy ones who find themselves hard pressed by the\nthreatening mounting waters of the deluge. With this the writer allows\nus a deep look into the dark abyss of her longing for the sun-hero. We\nsee that her longing is in vain; she is a mortal, only for a short time\nborne upwards into the light by means of the highest longing, and then\nsinking to death, or, much more, urged upwards by the fear of death,\nlike the people before the deluge, and in spite of the desperate\nconflict, irretrievably given over to destruction. This is a mood which\nrecalls vividly the closing scene in “Cyrano de Bergerac”:[190]\n\n         _Cyrano_:\n\n         Oh, mais ... puisqu’elle est en chemin,\n         Je l’attendrai debout ... et l’épée à la main.\n\n         Que dites-vous?... C’est inutile? Je le sais.\n         Mais on ne se bat pas dans l’espoir du succès.\n         Non, non. C’est bien plus beau lorsque c’est inutile.\n\n         Je sais bien qu’à la fin vous me mettrez à bas....\n\nWe already know sufficiently well what longing and what impulse it is\nthat attempts to clear a way for itself to the light, but that it may be\nrealized quite clearly and irrevocably, it is shown plainly in the\nquotation “No, let me die,” which confirms and completes all earlier\nremarks. The divine, the “much-beloved,” who is honored in the image of\nthe sun, is also the goal of the longing of our poet.\n\nByron’s “Heaven and Earth” is a mystery founded on the following passage\nfrom Genesis, chapter vi:2: “And it came to pass ... that the sons of\nGod saw the daughters of men that they were fair, and they took them\nwives of all that they chose.” Byron offers as a further motif for his\npoem the following passage from Coleridge: “_And woman wailing for her\nDemon lover_.” Byron’s poem is concerned with two great events, one\npsychologic and one telluric; the passion which throws down all\nbarriers; and all the terrors of the unchained powers of nature: a\nparallel which has already been introduced into our earlier discussion.\nThe angels Samiasa and Azaziel burn with sinful love for the beautiful\ndaughters of Cain, Anah and Aholibama, and force a way through the\nbarrier which is placed between mortal and immortal. They revolt as\nLucifer once did against God, and the archangel Raphael raises his voice\nwarningly:\n\n           “But man hath listened to his voice\n           And ye to woman’s—beautiful she is,\n           The serpent’s voice less subtle than her kiss.\n           The snake but vanquished dust; but she will draw\n           A second host from heaven to break heaven’s law.”\n\nThe power of God is threatened by the seduction of passion; a second\nfall of angels menaces heaven. Let us translate this mythologic\nprojection back into the psychologic, from whence it originated. Then it\nwould read: the power of the good and reasonable ruling the world wisely\nis threatened by the chaotic primitive power of passion; therefore\npassion must be exterminated; that is to say, projected into mythology.\nThe race of Cain and the whole sinful world must be destroyed from the\nroots by the deluge. It is the inevitable result of that sinful passion\nwhich has broken through all barriers. Its counterpart is the sea and\nthe waters of the deep and the floods of rain,[191] the generating,\nfructifying and “maternal waters,” as the Indian mythology refers to\nthem. Now they leave their natural bounds and surge over the mountain\ntops, engulfing all living things; for passion destroys itself. The\nlibido is God and Devil. With the destruction of the sinfulness of the\nlibido an essential portion of the libido would be destroyed. Through\nthe loss of the Devil, God himself suffered a considerable loss,\nsomewhat like an amputation upon the body of the Divinity. The\nmysterious hint in Raphael’s lament concerning the two rebels, Samiasa\nand Azaziel, suggests this.\n\n                                          “... Why,\n              Cannot this earth be made, or be destroyed,\n              Without involving ever some vast void\n              In the immortal ranks?...”\n\nLove raises man, not only above himself, but also above the bounds of\nhis mortality and earthliness, up to divinity itself, and in the very\nact of raising him it destroys him. Mythologically, this\nself-presumption finds its striking expression in the building of the\nheaven-high tower of Babel, which brings confusion to mankind.[192] In\nByron’s poem it is the sinful ambition of the race of Cain, for love of\nwhich it makes even the stars subservient and leads away the sons of God\nthemselves. If, indeed, longing for the highest things—if I may speak\nso—is legitimate, then it lies in the circumstances that it leaves its\nhuman boundaries, that of sinfulness, and, therefore, destruction. The\nlonging of the moth for the star is not absolutely pure and transparent,\nbut glows in sultry mist, for man continues to be man. Through the\nexcess of his longing he draws down the divine into the corruption of\nhis passion;[193] therefore, he seems to raise himself to the Divine;\nbut with that his humanity is destroyed. Thus the love of Anah and\nAholibama for their angels becomes the ruin of gods and men. The\ninvocation with which Cain’s daughters implore their angels is\npsychologically an exact parallel to Miss Miller’s poem.\n\n     _Anah_:[194]\n\n     Seraph!\n     From thy sphere!\n     Whatever star[195] contains thy glory.\n\n     In the eternal depths of heaven\n     Albeit thou watchest with the ‘seven,’\n     Though through space infinite and hoary\n     Before thy bright wings worlds will be driven,\n\n               Yet hear!\n     Oh! think of her who holds thee dear!\n\n     And though she nothing is to thee,\n     Yet think that thou art all to her.\n\n            ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n     Eternity is in thy years,\n     Unborn, undying beauty in thine eyes;\n     With me thou canst not sympathize,\n     Except in love, and there thou must\n     Acknowledge that more loving dust\n     Ne’er wept beneath the skies.\n     Thou walkest thy many worlds,[196] thou seest\n     The face of him who made thee great,\n     As he hath made of me the least\n     Of those cast out from Eden’s gate;\n\n     Yet, Seraph, dear!\n               Oh hear!\n     For thou hast loved me, and I would not die\n     Until I know what I must die in knowing,\n     That thou forgettest in thine eternity\n     Her whose heart death could not keep from o’erflowing\n     For thee, immortal essence as thou art,[197]\n     Great is their love who love in sin and fear;\n     And such, I feel, are waging in my heart\n     A war unworthy: to an Adamite\n     Forgive, my Seraph! that such thoughts appear.\n     For sorrow is our element....\n\n            ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n         The hour is near\n     Which tells me we are not abandoned quite.\n         Appear! Appear!\n         Seraph!\n     My own Azaziel! be but here,\n     And leave the stars to their own light.\n\n     _Aholibama_:\n\n     I call thee, I await thee and I love thee.\n\n            ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n     Though I be formed of clay,\n     And thou of beams[198]\n     More bright than those of day on Eden’s streams,\n     Thine immortality cannot repay\n     With love more warm than mine\n     My love. There is a ray[199]\n     In me, which though forbidden yet to shine,\n     I feel was lighted at thy God’s and mine.[200]\n     It may be hidden long: death and decay\n     Our mother Eve bequeathed us—but my heart\n     Defies it: though this life must pass away,\n     Is that a cause for thee and me to part?\n\n            ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n     I can share all things, even immortal sorrow;\n     For thou hast ventured to share life with me,\n     And shall I shrink from thine eternity?\n     No, though the serpent’s sting[201] should pierce me through,\n     And thou thyself wert like the serpent, coil\n     Around me still.[202] And I will smile\n     And curse thee not, but hold\n     Thee in as warm a fold\n     As—but descend and prove\n     A mortal’s love\n     For an immortal....\n\nThe apparition of both angels which follows the invocation is, as\nalways, a shining vision of light.\n\n               _Aholibama_:\n\n               The clouds from off their pinions flinging\n               As though they bore to-morrow’s light.\n\n               _Anah_:\n\n               But if our father see the sight!\n\n               _Aholibama_:\n\n               He would but deem it was the moon\n               Rising unto some sorcerer’s tune\n               An hour too soon.\n\n                      ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n               _Anah_:\n\n               Lo! They have kindled all the west,\n               Like a returning sunset....\n               On Ararat’s late secret crest\n               A wild and many colored bow,\n               The remnant of their flashing path,\n               Now shines!...",
  "llm_raw_response": "The given text can be broken down into several coherent sections by topic:\n\n**Section 1: Ancient Sun-Worship and the Symbolism of the Moth and Sun**\n\nThe text begins by discussing the ancient pre-Asiatic civilizations' sun-worship and the idea of a god dying and rising again. It mentions various gods and goddesses associated with the sun, such as Osiris, Tammuz, Attis-Adonis, Christ, Mithra, and Phœnix. The text also touches on the symbolism of the moth and sun, which is mentioned in Miss Miller's poem.\n\n**Section 2: The Death Phantasies and the Longing for the Sun-Hero**\n\nThe text delves deeper into the theme of death phantasies and the longing for the sun-hero. It discusses how the poet's longing is in vain, and how she is a mortal, only for a short time borne upwards into the light by means of the highest longing. The text also mentions the poem \"Heaven and Earth\" by Byron, which is a mystery founded on the passage from Genesis, chapter vi:2.\n\n**Section 3: The Mythological Projection of Passion**\n\nThe text explores the mythological projection of passion, which is the idea that the power of the good and reasonable ruling the world wisely is threatened by the chaotic primitive power of passion. It mentions the myth of the angels Samiasa and Azaziel, who burn with sinful love for the beautiful daughters of Cain, Anah and Aholibama. The text also discusses how this mythological projection is a way of explaining the destructive power of passion.\n\n**Section 4: The Love of Anah and Aholibama for their Angels**\n\nThe text continues to explore the theme of the love of Anah and Aholibama for their angels, which is a parallel to Miss Miller's poem. It discusses how this love is a form of sin and fear, and how it is a war unworthy of an Adamite. The text also mentions the poem \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" which is a vivid example of the longing for the sun-hero.\n\n**Section 5: The Building of the Tower of Babel and the Sinful Ambition of the Race of Cain**\n\nThe text discusses the building of the tower of Babel, which is a symbol of the sinful ambition of the race of Cain. It mentions how this ambition leads to the downfall of humanity and the destruction of the world. The text also touches on the idea that the longing for the highest things is legitimate, but it must be tempered by the recognition of its destructive power.\n\n**Section 6: The Longing of the Moth for the Star and the Corruption of Passion**\n\nThe text concludes by discussing the longing of the moth for the star, which is not absolutely pure and transparent. It mentions how this longing draws down the divine into the corruption of passion, and how it is a form of self-destruction. The text also touches on the idea that the love of Anah and Aholibama for their angels is a form of mortal love that defies the serpent's sting and the immortal's eternity.",
