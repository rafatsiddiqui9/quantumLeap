    "paragraph": "\u201cGod delivereth me to the ungodly,    And casteth me into the hands of the wicked,    I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;    Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:\u201c_He hath also set me up for his mark.    His archers compass me round about_;    He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;    He poureth out my gall upon the ground.    He breaketh me with breach upon breach;    He runneth upon me like a giant.\u201d\u2014_Job_ xvi: 11\u201315.The analogy of feeling lies in the suffering of the hopeless struggle against the more powerful. It is as if this conflict were accompanied from afar by the sounds of \u201ccreation,\u201d which brings up a beautiful and mysterious image belonging to the unconscious, and which has not yet forced its way up to the light of the upper world. We surmise, rather than know, that this battle has really something to do with creation, with the struggles between negations and affirmations. The references to Rostand\u2019s \u201cCyrano\u201d through the identification with Christian, to Milton\u2019s \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d to the sorrows of Job, misunderstood by his friends, betray plainly that in the soul of the poet something was identified with these ideas. She also has suffered like Cyrano and Job, has lost paradise, and dreams of \u201ccreation,\u201d\u2014creation by means of thought\u2014fruition through the whirlwind of Anaxagoras.[71]We once more submit ourselves to Miss Miller\u2019s guidance:\u201cI remember that when fifteen years old, I was once very much stirred  up over an article, read aloud to me by my mother, concerning the idea  which spontaneously produced its object. I was so excited that I could  not sleep all night because of thinking over and over again what that  could mean.",

    "question": "What was the experience of the author at the age of fifteen, and how did it relate to the idea of spontaneous creation?\n\n**ANSIS**",
    "answer": "At the age of fifteen, the author was deeply moved by an article read aloud to her by her mother, which discussed the idea of spontaneously producing its object. This experience was so intense that the author could not sleep all night, constantly thinking about what that could mean. This personal experience reflects a similar kind of profound and mysterious feeling, aligning with the concepts of spontaneous creation and the struggles of Job, as described in the passage.",
