    "paragraph": "To the degree that the modern consciousness is eagerly busied with things of a wholly other sort than religion, religion and its object, original sin, have stepped into the background; that is to say, into the unconscious in great part. Therefore, to-day man believes neither in the one nor in the other. Consequently the Freudian school is accused of an impure phantasy, and yet one might convince one\u2019s self very easily with a rather fleeting glance at the history of ancient religions and morals as to what kind of demons are harbored in the human soul. With this disbelief in the crudeness of human nature is bound up the disbelief in the power of religion. The phenomenon, well known to every psychoanalyst, of the unconscious transformation of an erotic conflict into religious activity is something _ethically wholly worthless_ and nothing but an hysterical production. Whoever, on the other hand, to his conscious sin just as consciously places religion in opposition, does something the greatness of which cannot be denied. This can be verified by a backward glance over history. Such a procedure is sound religion. _The unconscious recasting of the erotic into something religious lays itself open to the reproach of a sentimental and ethically worthless pose._",

    "question": "How has the modern consciousness affected the role of religion in society?",
    "answer": "The modern consciousness has shifted its focus to areas other than religion, causing religion and its concepts, such as original sin, to move into the background. This has led to a widespread disbelief in both religion and its objects, resulting in a situation where people neither believe in religion nor in the concepts it embodies.",
