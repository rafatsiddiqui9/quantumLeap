    "paragraph": "\u201cProcedit Christus quasi sponsus de thalamo suo, pr\u00e6sagio nuptiarum  exiit ad campum s\u00e6culi; pervenit usque ad crucis torum (torus has the  meaning of bed, pillow, concubine, bier) et ibi firmavit ascendendo  conjugium: ubi cum sentiret anhelantem in suspiriis creaturam  commercio pietatis se pro conjuge dedit ad p\u0153nam et copulavit sibi  perpetuo iure matronam.\u201dThis passage is perfectly clear. A similar death overtakes the Syrian Melcarth, who, riding upon a sea horse, was annually burned. Among the Greeks he is called Melicertes, and was represented riding upon a dolphin. The dolphin is also the steed of Arion. We have learned to recognize previously the maternal significance of dolphin, so that in the death of Melcarth we can once more recognize the negatively expressed Hierosgamos with the mother. (Compare Frazer \u201cGolden Bough,\u201d IV, p. 87.) This figurative expression is of the greatest teleological significance. Through its symbol it leads that libido which inclines backward into the original, primitive and impulsive upwards to the spiritual by investing it with a mysterious but fruitful function. It is superfluous to speak of the effect of this symbol upon the unconscious of Occidental humanity. A glance over history shows what creative forces were released in this symbol.[846]The comparison of the Mithraic and the Christian sacrifice plainly shows wherein lies the superiority of the Christian symbol; it is the frank admission that not only are the lower wishes to be sacrificed, but the whole personality. The Christian symbol demands complete devotion; it compels a veritable self-sacrifice to a higher purpose, while the Sacrificium Mithriacum, remaining fixed on a primitive symbolic stage, is contented with an animal sacrifice. The religious effect of these symbols must be considered as an orientation of the unconscious by means of imitation.",

    "question": "How does the death of Melcarth, as described in the passage, relate to the concept of Hierosgamos?\n\n**ANSAR:**\nThe death of Melcarth, who was annually burned, symbolizes a negatively expressed Hierosgamos with the mother. Hierosgamos typically refers to a sacred marriage or union, and in this context, the death of Melcarth signifies a ritual that symbolizes a union with the mother archetype, often representing a return to the maternal and the original state.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the maternal significance of the dolphin, and how is it illustrated in the passage?",
    "answer": "The dolphin is a symbol of the maternal. In the passage, it is mentioned that the dolphin is the steed of Arion, and in the death of Melcarth, it is recognized that the dolphin symbolizes the negatively expressed Hierosgamos with the mother. This illustrates the maternal and nurturing aspect of the dolphin in these symbolic contexts.",
