    "paragraph": "The problem which the simple story of the Abb\u00e9 Oegger has brought clearly before us confronts us again when we prepare to examine phantasies which owe their existence this time to an exclusively unconscious work. We are indebted for the material which we will use in the following chapters to the useful publication of an American woman, Miss Frank Miller, who has given to the world some poetical unconsciously formed phantasies under the title, \u201cQuelque faits d\u2019imagination cr\u00e9atrice subconsciente.\u201d\u2014_Vol. V., Archives de Psychologie, 1906._[56]CHAPTER II             THE MILLER PHANTASIESWe know, from much psychoanalytic experience, that whenever one recounts his phantasies or his dreams, he deals not only with the most important and intimate of his problems, but with the one the most painful at that moment.[57]Since in the case of Miss Miller we have to do with a complicated system, we must give our attention carefully to the particulars which I will discuss, following as best I can Miss Miller\u2019s presentation.In the first chapter, \u201cPh\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de suggestion passag\u00e8re ou d\u2019autosuggestion instantan\u00e9e,\u201d Miss Miller gives a list of examples of her unusual suggestibility, which she herself considers as a symptom of her nervous temperament; for example, she is excessively fond of caviar, whereas some of her relatives loathe it. However, as soon as any one expresses his loathing, she herself feels momentarily the same loathing. I do not need to emphasize especially the fact that such examples are very important in individual psychology; that caviar is a food for which nervous women frequently have an especial predilection, is a fact well known to the psychoanalyst.",

    "answer": "Miss Miller's suggestibility is described as unusual and part of a \"complicated system.\" For example, she is excessively fond of caviar, but when someone else expresses a loathing for caviar, she momentarily feels the same loathing. This is considered a symptom of her nervous temperament.",
