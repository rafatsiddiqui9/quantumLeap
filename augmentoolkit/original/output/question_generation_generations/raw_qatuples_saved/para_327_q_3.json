    "paragraph": "The visionary phenomena, produced in the first stages of introversion, are grouped among the well-known phenomena[348] of hypnagogic vision. They form, as I explained in an earlier paper, the foundation of the true visions of the symbolic autorevelations of the libido, as we may now express it.Miss Miller continues:\u201cThen I had the impression that some communication was immediately  impending. It seemed to me as if there were re-echoed in me the words,  \u2018Speak, O Lord, for Thy servant listens; open Thou mine ears!\u2019\u201dThis passage very clearly describes the intention; the expression \u201ccommunication\u201d is even a current term in spiritualistic circles. The Biblical words contain a clear invocation or \u201cprayer,\u201d that is to say, a wish (libido) directed towards divinity (the unconscious complex). The prayer refers to Samuel, i:3, where Samuel at night was three times called by God, but believed that it was Eli calling, until the latter informed him that it was God himself who spoke, and that he must answer if his name was called again\u2014\u201cSpeak, O Lord, for Thy Servant hears!\u201d The dreamer uses these words really in an inverse sense, namely, in order to produce God with them. With that she directs her desires, her libido, into the depths of her unconscious.",
