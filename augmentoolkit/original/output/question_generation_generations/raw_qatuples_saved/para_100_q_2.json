    "paragraph": "A six-year-old girl, who goes to school unwillingly, dreams that her leg is encircled by a large red worm. She had a tender interest for this creature, contrary to what might be expected. An adult patient, who cannot separate from an older friend on account of an extraordinarily strong mother transference, dreams that \u201cshe had to get across some deep water (typical idea!) with this friend; her friend fell in (mother transference); she tries to drag her out, and almost succeeds, but a large crab seizes on the dreamer by the foot and tries to pull her in.\u201d",

    "question": "How might a psychologist explain the recurring theme of water in the dreams of both the six-year-old girl and the adult patient?",
    "answer": "The recurring theme of water in both dreams could symbolize the emotional depths and the unconscious mind. Water is often seen as a symbol of the unconscious, the unknown, and the fluid nature of emotions. In both cases, the water could represent the patient's emotional state and the difficulties they face in navigating their relationships and personal growth.",
