    "question": "What is Mithracism, and why is it still considered valuable despite its association with religion?",
    "answer": "Mithracism is a religion that has provided significant contributions to education, even though it is associated with religion and morality. Despite this association, its form of thought and wisdom of life have been proven to be particularly effective over two thousand years. Therefore, it can still be beneficial to use aspects of Mithracism in modern contexts.",
