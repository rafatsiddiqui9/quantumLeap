    "paragraph": "Mythologically this means: the hero seeks the lost sun, the fire, the virgin sacrifice, or the treasure, and fights the typical fight with the dragon, with the libido in resistance. As these parallels show, psychoanalysis mobiles a part of the life processes, the fundamental importance of which properly illustrates the significance of this process.After Siegfried has slain the dragon, he meets the father, Wotan, plagued by gloomy cares, for the primitive mother, Erda, has placed in his path the snake, in order to enfeeble his sun. He says to Erda:_Wanderer_:All-wise one,        Care\u2019s piercing sting by thee was planted        In Wotan\u2019s dauntless heart        With fear of shameful ruin and downfall.        Filled was his spirit by tidings        Thou didst foretell.        Art thou the world\u2019s wisest of women?        Tell to me now        How a god may conquer his care._Erda_:Thou art not        What thou hast said.It is the same primitive motive which we meet Wagner: the mother has robbed her son, the sun-god, of the joy of life, through a poisonous thorn, and deprives him of his power, which is connected with the name. Isis demands the name of the god; Erda says, \u201cThou art not what thou hast said.\u201d But the \u201cWanderer\u201d has found the way to conquer the fatal charm of the mother, the fear of death:\u201cThe eternals\u2019 downfall          No more dismays me,          Since their doom I willed.\u201cI leave to thee, loveliest W\u00e4lsung,          Gladly my heritage now.          To the ever-young          In gladness yieldeth the god!\u201d",

    "question": "How does the hero, Siegfried, ultimately conquer the fear of death and the fatal charm of the mother?",
    "answer": "Siegfried conquers the fear of death and the fatal charm of the mother by recognizing the inevitability of the eternal cycle of life and death. He expresses his newfound acceptance by stating, \"The eternals\u2019 downfall No more dismays me, Since their doom I willed.\" He then willingly passes on his heritage to the eternal, youthful god, illustrating his mastery over the forces that seek to control him.",
