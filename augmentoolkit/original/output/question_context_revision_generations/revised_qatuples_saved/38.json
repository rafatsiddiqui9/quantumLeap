{"paragraph": "In this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question whether the well-known longing for reality of the paranoic dement (and the dementia præcox patients),[245] to whom I have especially called attention in my book, “The Psychology of Dementia Præcox,”[246] is to be traced back to the withdrawal of the “libidinous affluxes” alone, or whether this coincides with the so-called objective interest in general. It is hardly to be assumed that the normal “fonction du réel” (Janet)[247] is maintained only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest. The fact is that in very many cases reality disappears entirely, so that not a trace of psychological adaptation or orientation can be recognized. Reality is repressed under these circumstances and replaced by the contents of the complex. One must of necessity say that not only the erotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared, that is to say, the whole adaptation to reality has ceased. To this category belong the stuporose and catatonic automatons.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "According to Freud, what does he suggest about the \"longing for reality\" in patients like those with paranoic dementia and dementia præcox?", "answer": "Freud suggests that the \"longing for reality\" in patients with paranoic dementia and dementia præcox is not solely due to the withdrawal of \"libidinous affluxes.\" Instead, it is also related to a general interest in reality, which may coincide with the \"objective interest.\" This interest seems to be crucial for maintaining psychological adaptation and orientation.", "question_group_id": "2139f276-22f6-4034-aa43-4a6467572161", "paragraph_idx": 7, "question_idx": 0}
