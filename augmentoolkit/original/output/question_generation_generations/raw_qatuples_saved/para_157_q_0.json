    "paragraph": "\u201cThe investigation of this folk-psychologic formation, myths, etc., is  by no means finished at present. To take an example of this, however,  it is probable that the myths correspond to the distorted residue of  wish phantasies of whole nations, the secularized dreams of young  humanity.\u201dRank[37] understands the myths in a similar manner, as a mass dream of the people.[38] Riklin[39] has insisted rightly upon the dream mechanism of the fables, and Abraham[40] has done the same for the myths. He says:\u201cThe myth is a fragment of the infantile soul-life of the people.\u201dand\u201cThus the myth is a _sustained, still remaining_ fragment from the  infantile soul-life of the people, and the dream is the myth of the  individual.\u201dAn unprejudiced reading of the above-mentioned authors will certainly allay all doubts concerning the intimate connection between dream psychology and myth psychology. The conclusion results almost from itself, that the age which created the myths thought childishly\u2014that is to say, phantastically, as in our age is still done, to a very great extent (associatively or analogically) in dreams. The beginnings of myth formations (in the child), the taking of phantasies for realities, which is partly in accord with the historical, may easily be discovered among children.",
