    "paragraph": "If my readers have had patience to read thus far, and to reflect upon what they have read, they frequently must have wondered at the number of times I introduce for comparison such apparently foreign material and how often I widen the base upon which Miss Miller\u2019s creations rest. Doubts must often have arisen whether it is justifiable to enter into important discussions concerning the psychologic foundations of myths, religions and culture in general on the basis of such scanty suggestions. It might be said that behind the Miller phantasies such a thing is scarcely to be found. I need hardly emphasize the fact that I, too, have sometimes been in doubt. I had never read \u201cHiawatha\u201d until, in the course of my work, I came to this part. \u201cHiawatha,\u201d a poetical compilation of Indian myths, gives me, however, a justification for all preceding reflections, because this epic contains an unusual number of mythologic problems. This fact is probably of great importance for the wealth of suggestions in the Miller phantasies. We are, therefore, compelled to obtain an insight into this epic.Nawadaha sings the songs of the epic of the hero Hiawatha, the friend of man:\u201cThere he sang of Hiawatha,         Sang the songs of Hiawatha,         Sang his wondrous birth and being,         How he prayed and how he fasted,         How he lived and toiled and suffered,         That the tribes of men might prosper,         That he might advance his people.\u201d",

    "question": "Why does the author introduce \"Hiawatha\" and other foreign material in the discussion about Miss Miller's creations?",
    "answer": "The author introduces \"Hiawatha\" and other foreign material to provide a broader base for discussions on the psychologic foundations of myths, religions, and culture. Despite the apparent foreignness of these examples, they offer a wealth of mythologic problems that justify the preceding reflections on Miss Miller's phantasies.",
