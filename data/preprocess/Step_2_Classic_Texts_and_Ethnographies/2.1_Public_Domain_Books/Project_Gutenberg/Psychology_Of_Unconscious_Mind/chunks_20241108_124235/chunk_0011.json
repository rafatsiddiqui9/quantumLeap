To-day, indeed, in our civilization\nthe phallic processions, the Dionysian mysteries of classical Athens,\nthe barefaced Phallic emblems, have disappeared from our coins, houses,\ntemples and streets; so also have the theriomorphic representations of\nthe Deity been reduced to small remnants, like the Dove of the Holy\nGhost, the Lamb of God and the Cock of Peter adorning our church towers.\nIn the same way, the capture and violation of women have shrunken away\nto crimes. Yet all of this does not affect the fact that we, in\nchildhood, go through a period in which the impulses toward these\narchaic inclinations appear again and again, and that through all our\nlife we possess, side by side with the newly recruited, directed and\nadapted thought, a phantastic thought which corresponds to the thought\nof the centuries of antiquity and barbarism. Just as our bodies still\nkeep the reminders of old functions and conditions in many old-fashioned\norgans, so our minds, too, which apparently have outgrown those archaic\ntendencies, nevertheless bear the marks of the evolution passed through,\nand the very ancient re-echoes, at least dreamily, in phantasies.\n\nThe symbolism which Freud has discovered, is revealed as an expression\nof a thinking and of an impulse limited to the dream, to wrong conduct,\nand to derangements of the mind, which form of thinking and impulse at\none time ruled as the mightiest influence in past culture epochs.\n\nThe question of _whence_ comes the inclination and ability which enables\nthe mind to express itself symbolically, brings us to the distinction\nbetween the two kinds of thinking—the directed and adapted on one hand,\nand the subjective, fed by our own egotistic wishes, on the other. The\nlatter form of thinking, presupposing that it were not constantly\ncorrected by the adapted thinking, must necessarily produce an\noverwhelmingly subjectively distorted idea of the world. We regard this\nstate of mind as infantile. It lies in our individual past, and in the\npast of mankind.\n\nWith this we affirm the important fact that man in his phantastic\nthinking has kept a condensation of the psychic history of his\ndevelopment. An extraordinarily important task, which even to-day is\nhardly possible, is to give a systematic description of phantastic\nthinking. One may, at the most, sketch it. While directed thinking is a\nphenomenon conscious throughout,[49] the same cannot be asserted of\nphantastic thinking. Doubtless, a great part of it still falls entirely\nin the realm of the conscious, but, at least, just as much goes along in\nhalf shadows, and generally an undetermined amount in the unconscious;\nand this can, therefore, be disclosed only indirectly.[50] By means of\nphantastic thinking, directed thinking is connected with the oldest\nfoundations of the human mind, which have been for a long time beneath\nthe threshold of the consciousness. The products of this phantastic\nthinking arising directly from the consciousness are, first, waking\ndreams, or day-dreams, to which Freud, Flournoy, Pick and others have\ngiven special attention; then the dreams which offer to the\nconsciousness, at first, a mysterious exterior, and win meaning only\nthrough the indirectly inferred unconscious contents. Lastly, there is a\nso-called wholly unconscious phantasy system in the split-off complex,\nwhich exhibits a pronounced tendency towards the production of a\ndissociated personality.[51]\n\nOur foregoing explanations show wherein the products arising from the\nunconscious are related to the mythical. From all these signs it may be\nconcluded that the soul possesses in some degree historical strata, the\noldest stratum of which would correspond to the unconscious. The result\nof that must be that an introversion occurring in later life, according\nto the Freudian teaching, seizes upon regressive infantile reminiscences\ntaken from the individual past. That first points out the way; then,\nwith stronger introversion and regression (strong repressions,\nintroversion psychoses), there come to light pronounced traits of an\narchaic mental kind which, under certain circumstances, might go as far\nas the re-echo of a once manifest, archaic mental product.\n\nThis problem deserves to be more thoroughly discussed. As a concrete\nexample, let us take the history of the pious Abbé Oegger which Anatole\nFrance has communicated to us.[52] This priest was a hypercritical man,\nand much given to phantasies, especially in regard to one question,\nviz., the fate of Judas; whether he was really damned, as the teaching\nof the church asserts, to everlasting punishment, or whether God had\npardoned him after all. Oegger sided with the intelligent point of view\nthat God, in his all-wisdom, had chosen Judas as an instrument, in order\nto bring about the highest point of the work of redemption by\nChrist.[53] This necessary instrument, without the help of which the\nhuman race would not have been a sharer in salvation, could not possibly\nbe damned by the all-good God. In order to put an end to his doubts,\nOegger went one night to the church, and made supplication for a sign\nthat Judas was saved. Then he felt a heavenly touch upon his shoulder.\nFollowing this, Oegger told the Archbishop of his resolution to go out\ninto the world to preach God’s unending mercy.\n\nHere we have a richly developed phantasy system before us. It is\nconcerned with the subtle and perpetually undecided question as to\nwhether the legendary figure of Judas is damned or not. The Judas legend\nis, in itself, mythical material, viz., the malicious betrayal of a\nhero. I recall Siegfried and Hagen, Balder and Loki. Siegfried and\nBalder were murdered by a faithless traitor from among their closest\nassociates. This myth is moving and tragic—it is not honorable battle\nwhich kills the noble, but evil treachery. It is, too, an occurrence\nwhich is historical over and over again. One thinks of Cæsar and Brutus.\nSince the myth of such a deed is very old, and still the subject of\nteaching and repetition, it is the expression of a psychological fact,\nthat envy does not allow humanity to sleep, and that all of us carry, in\na hidden recess of our heart, a deadly wish towards the hero. This rule\ncan be applied generally to mythical tradition. _It does not set forth\nany account of the old events, but rather acts in such a way that it\nalways reveals a thought common to humanity, and once more rejuvenated._\nThus, for example, the lives and deeds of the founders of old religions\nare the purest condensations of typical, contemporaneous myths, behind\nwhich the individual figure entirely disappears.[54]\n\nBut why does our pious Abbé torment himself with the old Judas legend?\nHe first went into the world to preach the gospel of mercy, and then,\nafter some time, he separated from the Catholic church and became a\nSwedenborgian. Now we understand his Judas phantasy. _He was the Judas_\nwho betrayed his Lord. Therefore, first of all, he had to make sure of\nthe divine mercy, in order to be Judas in peace.\n\nThis case throws a light upon the mechanism of the phantasies in\ngeneral. The known, conscious phantasy may be of mythical or other\nmaterial; it is not to be taken seriously as such, for it has an\nindirect meaning. If we take it, however, as important per se, then the\nthing is not understandable, and makes one despair of the efficiency of\nthe mind. But we saw, in the case of Abbé Oegger, that his doubts and\nhis hopes did not turn upon the historical problem of Judas, but upon\nhis own personality, which wished to win a way to freedom for itself\nthrough the solution of the Judas problem.\n\n_The conscious phantasies tell us of mythical or other material of\nundeveloped or no longer recognized wish tendencies in the soul._ As is\neasily to be understood, an innate tendency, an acknowledgment of which\none refuses to make, and which one treats as non-existent, can hardly\ncontain a thing that may be in accord with our conscious character. It\nconcerns the tendencies which are considered immoral, and as generally\nimpossible, and the strongest resentment is felt towards bringing them\ninto the consciousness. What would Oegger have said had he been told\nconfidentially that he was preparing himself for the Judas rôle? And\nwhat in ourselves do we consider immoral and non-existent, or which we\nat least wish were non-existent? It is that which in antiquity lay\nwidespread on the surface, viz., sexuality in all its various\nmanifestations. Therefore, we need not wonder in the least when we find\nthis at the base of most of our phantasies, even if the phantasies have\na different appearance. Because Oegger found the damnation of Judas\nincompatible with God’s goodness, he thought about the conflict in that\nway; that is the conscious sequence. Along with this is the unconscious\nsequence; because Oegger himself wished to be a Judas, he first made\nsure of the goodness of God. To Oegger, Judas was the symbol of his own\nunconscious tendency, and he made use of this symbol in order to be able\nto meditate over his unconscious wish. The direct coming into\nconsciousness of the Judas wish would have been too painful for him.\n_Thus, there must be typical myths which are really the instruments of a\nfolk-psychological complex treatment._ Jacob Burckhardt seems to have\nsuspected this when he once said that every Greek of the classical era\ncarried in himself a fragment of the Oedipus, just as every German\ncarries a fragment of Faust.[55]\n\nThe problem which the simple story of the Abbé Oegger has brought\nclearly before us confronts us again when we prepare to examine\nphantasies which owe their existence this time to an exclusively\nunconscious work. We are indebted for the material which we will use in\nthe following chapters to the useful publication of an American woman,\nMiss Frank Miller, who has given to the world some poetical\nunconsciously formed phantasies under the title, “Quelque faits\nd’imagination créatrice subconsciente.”—_Vol. V., Archives de\nPsychologie, 1906._[56]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER II\n                         THE MILLER PHANTASIES\n\n\nWe know, from much psychoanalytic experience, that whenever one recounts\nhis phantasies or his dreams, he deals not only with the most important\nand intimate of his problems, but with the one the most painful at that\nmoment.[57]\n\nSince in the case of Miss Miller we have to do with a complicated\nsystem, we must give our attention carefully to the particulars which I\nwill discuss, following as best I can Miss Miller’s presentation.\n\nIn the first chapter, “Phénomènes de suggestion passagère ou\nd’autosuggestion instantanée,” Miss Miller gives a list of examples of\nher unusual suggestibility, which she herself considers as a symptom of\nher nervous temperament; for example, she is excessively fond of caviar,\nwhereas some of her relatives loathe it. However, as soon as any one\nexpresses his loathing, she herself feels momentarily the same loathing.\nI do not need to emphasize especially the fact that such examples are\nvery important in individual psychology; that caviar is a food for which\nnervous women frequently have an especial predilection, is a fact well\nknown to the psychoanalyst.\n\nMiss Miller has an extraordinary faculty for taking other people’s\nfeelings upon herself, and of identification; for example, she\nidentifies herself to such a degree in “Cyrano” with the wounded\nChristian de Neuvillette, that she feels in her own breast a truly\npiercing pain at that place where Christian received the deadly blow.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of analytic psychology, the theatre, aside from any\nesthetic value, may be considered as an institution for the treatment of\nthe mass complex. The enjoyment of the comedy, or of the dramatic plot\nending happily is produced by an unreserved identification of one’s own\ncomplexes with the play. The enjoyment of tragedy lies in the thrilling\nyet satisfactory feeling that something which might occur to one’s self\nis happening to another. The sympathy of our author with the dying\nChristian means that there is in her a complex awaiting a similar\nsolution, which whispers softly to her “hodie tibi, cras mihi,” and that\none may know exactly what is considered the effectual moment Miss Miller\nadds that she felt a pain in her breast, “Lorsque Sarah Bernhardt se\nprécipite sur lui pour étancher le sang de sa blessure.” Therefore the\neffectual moment is when the love between Christian and Roxane comes to\na sudden end.\n\nIf we glance over the whole of Rostand’s play, we come upon certain\nmoments, the effect of which one cannot easily escape and which we will\nemphasize here because they have meaning for all that follows. Cyrano de\nBergerac, with the long ugly nose, on account of which he undertakes\ncountless duels, loves Roxane, who, for her part unaware of it, loves\nChristian, because of the beautiful verses which really originate from\nCyrano’s pen, but which apparently come from Christian. Cyrano is the\nmisunderstood one, whose passionate love and noble soul no one suspects;\nthe hero who sacrifices himself for others, and, dying, just in the\nevening of life, reads to her once more Christian’s last letter, the\nverses which he himself had composed.",
