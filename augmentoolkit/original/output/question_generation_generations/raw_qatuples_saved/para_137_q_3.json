    "paragraph": "\u201cWhat was hidden in the shell,     Was born through the power of fiery torments.     From this first arose love,     As the germ of knowledge,     The wise found the roots of existence in non-existence,     By investigating the hearts impulses.\u201d[768]This philosophical view interprets the world as an emanation of the libido, and this must be widely accepted from the theoretic as well as the psychologic standpoint, for the function of reality is an instinctive function, having the character of biological adaptation. When the insane Schreber brought about the end of the world through his libido-introversion, he expressed an entirely rational psychologic view, just as Schopenhauer wished to abolish through negation (holiness, asceticism) the error of the primal will, through which the world was created. Does not Goethe say:\u201cYou follow a false trail;         Do not think that we are not serious;         Is not the kernel of nature         In the hearts of men?\u201dThe hero, who is to accomplish the rejuvenation of the world and the conquest of death, is the libido, which, brooding upon itself in introversion, coiling as a snake around its own egg, apparently threatens life with a poisonous bite, in order to lead it to death, and from that darkness, conquering itself, gives birth to itself again. Nietzsche knows this conception:[769]\u201cHow long have you sat already upon your misfortune.      Give heed! lest you hatch an egg,      A basilisk egg      Of your long travail.\u201d",

    "question": "How is the hero in the text associated with the concept of rejuvenation and overcoming death?",
    "answer": "The hero in the text is associated with the concept of rejuvenation and overcoming death through the introspective and introspective process of the libido. This hero is seen as brooding upon itself in introversion, coiling like a snake around its own egg, which represents the potential for both destruction and rebirth. Through this introspective process, the hero leads life to a state of death, only to rise again, symbolizing a cycle of rebirth and renewal.",
