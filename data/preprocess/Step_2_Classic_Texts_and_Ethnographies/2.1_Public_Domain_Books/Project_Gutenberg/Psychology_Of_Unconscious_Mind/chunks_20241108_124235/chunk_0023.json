We recall this overpowering weight in the scale\nof God’s justice in regard to the man Job. There, where the deep sources\nof the ocean are, the leviathan lives; from there the all-destroying\nflood ascends, the all-engulfing flood of animal passion. That stifling,\ncompressing feeling[203] of the onward-surging impulse is projected\nmythologically as a flood which, rising up and over all, destroys all\nthat exists, in order to allow a new and better creation to come forth\nfrom this destruction.\n\n          _Japhet_:\n\n          The eternal will\n          Shall deign to expound this dream\n          Of good and evil; and redeem\n          Unto himself all times, all things;\n\n          And, gather’d under his almighty wings,\n          Abolish hell!\n          And to the expiated Earth\n          Restore the beauty of her birth.\n\n          _Spirits_:\n\n          And when shall take effect this wondrous spell?\n\n          _Japhet_:\n\n          When the Redeemer cometh; first in pain\n          And then in glory.\n\n          _Spirits_:\n\n          New times, new climes, new arts, new men, but still\n          The same old tears, old crimes, and oldest ill,\n          Shall be amongst your race in different forms;\n          But the same mortal storms\n          Shall oversweep the future, as the waves\n          In a few hours the glorious giants’ graves.\n\nThe prophetic visions of Japhet have almost prophetic meaning for our\npoetess; with the death of the moth in the light, evil is once more laid\naside; the complex has once again, even if in a censored form, expressed\nitself. With that, however, the problem is not solved; all sorrow and\nevery longing begins again from the beginning, but there is “Promise in\nthe Air”—the premonition of the Redeemer, of the “Well-beloved,” of the\nSun-hero, who again mounts to the height of the sun and again descends\nto the coldness of the winter, who is the light of hope from race to\nrace, the image of the libido.\n\n\n\n\n                                PART II\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER I\n                         ASPECTS OF THE LIBIDO\n\n\nBefore I enter upon the contents of this second part, it seems necessary\nto cast a backward glance over the singular train of thought which the\nanalysis of the poem “The Moth to the Sun” has produced. Although this\npoem is very different from the foregoing Hymn of Creation, closer\ninvestigation of the “longing for the sun” has carried us into the realm\nof the fundamental ideas of religion and astral mythology, which ideas\nare closely related to those considered in the first poem. The creative\nGod of the first poem, whose dual nature, moral and physical, was shown\nespecially clearly to us by Job, has in the second poem a new\nqualification of astral-mythological, or, to express it better, of\nastrological character. The God becomes the sun, and in this finds an\nadequate natural expression quite apart from the moral division of the\nGod idea into the heavenly father and the devil. The sun is, as Renan\nremarked, really the only rational representation of God, whether we\ntake the point of view of the barbarians of other ages or that of the\nmodern physical sciences. In both cases the sun is the parent God,\nmythologically predominantly the Father God, from whom all living things\ndraw life; He is the fructifier and creator of all that lives, the\nsource of energy of our world. The discord into which the soul of man\nhas fallen through the action of moral laws[204] can be resolved into\ncomplete harmony through the sun as the natural object which obeys no\nhuman moral law. The sun is not only beneficial, but also destructive;\ntherefore the zodiacal representation of the August heat is the\nherd-devouring lion whom the Jewish hero Samson[205] killed in order to\nfree the parched earth from this plague. Yet it is the harmonious and\ninherent nature of the sun to scorch, and its scorching power seems\nnatural to men. It shines equally on the just and on the unjust, and\nallows useful living objects to flourish as well as harmful ones.\nTherefore, the sun is adapted as is nothing else to represent the\nvisible God of this world. That is to say, that driving strength of our\nown soul, which we call libido, and whose nature it is to allow the\nuseful and injurious, the good and the bad to proceed. That this\ncomparison is no mere play of words is taught us by the mystics. When by\nlooking inwards (introversion) and going down into the depths of their\nown being they find “in their heart” the image of the Sun, they find\ntheir own love or libido, which with reason, I might say with physical\nreason, is called the Sun; for our source of energy and life is the Sun.\nThus our life substance, as an energic process, is entirely Sun. Of what\nspecial sort this “Sun energy” seen inwardly by the mystic is, is shown\nby an example taken from the Hindoo mythology.[206] From the explanation\nof Part III of the “Shvetâshvataropanishad” we take the following\nquotation, which relates to the Rudra:[207]\n\n  (2) “Yea, the one Rudra who all these worlds with ruling power doth\n  rule, stands not for any second. Behind those that are born he stands;\n  at ending time ingathers all the worlds he hath evolved, protector\n  (he).\n\n  (3) “He hath eyes on all sides, on all sides surely hath faces, arms\n  surely on all sides, on all sides feet. With arms, with wings he\n  tricks them out, creating heaven and earth, the only God.\n\n  (4) “Who of the gods is both the source and growth, the Lord of all,\n  the Rudra. Mighty seer; who brought the shining germ of old into\n  existence—may he with reason pure conjoin us.”[208]\n\nThese attributes allow us clearly to discern the all-creator and in him\nthe Sun, which has wings and with a thousand eyes scans the world.[209]\n\nThe following passages confirm the text and join to it the idea most\nimportant for us, that God is also contained in the individual creature:\n\n  (7) “Beyond this (world) the Brahman beyond, the mighty one, in every\n  creature hid according to its form, the one encircling Lord of all,\n  Him having known, immortal they become.\n\n  (8) “I know this mighty man, Sun-like, beyond the darkness, Him (and\n  him) only knowing, one crosseth over death; no other path (at all) is\n  there to go.\n\n  (11) “... spread over the universe is He the Lord therefore as\n  all-pervader, He’s benign.”\n\nThe powerful God, the equal of the Sun, is in that one, and whoever\nknows him is immortal.[210] Going on further with the text, we come upon\na new attribute, which informs us in what form and manner Rudra lived in\nmen.\n\n  (12) “The mighty monarch, He, the man, the one who doth the essence\n  start towards that peace of perfect stainlessness, lordly, exhaustless\n  light.\n\n  (13) “The Man, the size of a thumb, the inner self, sits ever in the\n  heart of all that’s born, by mind, mind ruling in the heart, is He\n  revealed. That they who know, immortal they become.\n\n  (14) “The Man of the thousands of heads (and) thousands of eyes (and)\n  thousands of feet, covering the earth on all sides, He stands beyond,\n  ten finger-breadths.\n\n  (15) “The Man is verily this all, (both) what has been and what will\n  be, Lord (too) of deathlessness which far all else surpasses.”\n\nImportant parallel quotations are to be found in the “Kathopanishad,”\nsection 2, part 4.\n\n  (12) “The Man of the size of a thumb, resides in the midst within the\n  self, of the past and the future, the Lord.\n\n  (13) “The Man of the size of a thumb like flame free from smoke, of\n  past and of future the Lord, the same is to-day, to-morrow the same\n  will He be.”\n\nWho this Tom-Thumb is can easily be divined—the phallic symbol of the\nlibido. The phallus is this hero dwarf, who performs great deeds; he,\nthis ugly god in homely form, who is the great doer of wonders, since he\nis the visible expression of the creative strength incarnate in man.\nThis extraordinary contrast is also very striking in “Faust” (the mother\nscene):\n\n         _Mephistopheles_:\n\n         I’ll praise thee ere we separate: I see\n         Thou knowest the devil thoroughly:\n         Here take this key.\n\n         _Faust_:\n\n         That little thing!\n\n         _Mephistopheles_:\n\n         Take hold of it, not undervaluing!\n\n         _Faust_:\n\n         It glows, it shines, increases in my hand!\n\n         _Mephistopheles_:\n\n         How much it is worth, thou soon shalt understand,\n         The key will scent the true place from all others!\n         Follow it down!—’twill lead thee to the Mothers![211]\n\nHere the devil again puts into Faust’s hand the marvellous tool, a\nphallic symbol of the libido, as once before in the beginning the devil,\nin the form of the black dog, accompanied Faust, when he introduced\nhimself with the words:\n\n                  “Part of that power, not understood,\n        Which always wills the bad and always creates the good.”\n\nUnited to this strength, Faust succeeded in accomplishing his real life\ntask, at first through evil adventure and then for the benefit of\nhumanity, for without the evil there is no creative power. Here in the\nmysterious mother scene, where the poet unveils the last mystery of the\ncreative power to the initiated, Faust has need of the phallic magic\nwand (in the magic strength of which he has at first no confidence), in\norder to perform the greatest of wonders, namely, the creation of Paris\nand Helen. With that Faust attains the divine power of working miracles,\nand, indeed, only by means of this small, insignificant instrument. This\nparadoxical impression seems to be very ancient, for even the Upanishads\ncould say the following of the dwarf god:\n\n  (19) “Without hands, without feet, He moveth, He graspeth: Eyeless He\n  seeth, (and) earless He heareth: He knoweth what is to be known, yet\n  is there no knower of Him. Him call the first, mighty the Man.\n\n  (20) “Smaller than small, (yet) greater than great in the heart of\n  this creature the self doth repose ... etc.”",
