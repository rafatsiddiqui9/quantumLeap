    "paragraph": "\u201cThere the lord rested contemplating her body,     Then divided he the Colossus, planning wisely.     He cut it apart like a flat fish, into two parts,[530]     One half he took and with it he covered the Heavens.\u201dIn this manner Marduk created the universe from the mother. It is clearly evident that the killing of the mother-dragon here takes place under the idea of a wind fecundation with negative accompaniments.The world is created from the mother, that is to say, from the libido taken away from the mother through sacrifice. We shall have to consider this significant formula more closely in the last chapter. The most interesting parallels to this primitive myth are to be found in the literature of the Old Testament, as Gunkel[531] has brilliantly pointed out. It is worth while to trace the psychology of these parallels._Isaiah_ li:9:(9) \u201cAwake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the  ancient days, in the generation of old. Art thou not it that hath cut  Rahab, and wounded the dragon?(10) \u201cArt thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the  great deep, that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the  ransomed to pass over?\u201dThe name of Rahab is frequently used for Egypt in the Old Testament, also dragon. _Isaiah_, chapter xxx, verse 7, calls Egypt \u201cthe silent Rahab,\u201d and means, therefore, something evil and hostile. Rahab is the well-known whore of Jericho, who later, as the wife of Prince Salma, became the ancestress of Christ. Here Rahab appeared as the old dragon, as Ti\u00e2mat, against whose evil power Marduk, or Jehovah, marched forth. The expression \u201cthe ransomed\u201d refers to the Jews freed from bondage, but it is also mythological, for the hero again frees those previously devoured by the whale. (Frobenius.)_Psalm_, lxxxix:10:\u201cThou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain.\u201d_Job_ xxvi:12\u201313:",

    "answer": "The myth of Marduk dividing the Colossus and using one part to cover the Heavens symbolizes the creation of the universe from the mother, where the libido taken away from the mother through sacrifice is used to form the world. This process is associated with the idea of wind fecundation with negative accompaniments.",
