{"paragraph": "“God delivereth me to the ungodly,    And casteth me into the hands of the wicked,    I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;    Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:“_He hath also set me up for his mark.    His archers compass me round about_;    He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;    He poureth out my gall upon the ground.    He breaketh me with breach upon breach;    He runneth upon me like a giant.”—_Job_ xvi: 11–15.The analogy of feeling lies in the suffering of the hopeless struggle against the more powerful. It is as if this conflict were accompanied from afar by the sounds of “creation,” which brings up a beautiful and mysterious image belonging to the unconscious, and which has not yet forced its way up to the light of the upper world. We surmise, rather than know, that this battle has really something to do with creation, with the struggles between negations and affirmations. The references to Rostand’s “Cyrano” through the identification with Christian, to Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” to the sorrows of Job, misunderstood by his friends, betray plainly that in the soul of the poet something was identified with these ideas. She also has suffered like Cyrano and Job, has lost paradise, and dreams of “creation,”—creation by means of thought—fruition through the whirlwind of Anaxagoras.[71]We once more submit ourselves to Miss Miller’s guidance:“I remember that when fifteen years old, I was once very much stirred  up over an article, read aloud to me by my mother, concerning the idea  which spontaneously produced its object. I was so excited that I could  not sleep all night because of thinking over and over again what that  could mean.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the poet connect her own experiences to that of Job in [specific text or poet's name]?", "answer": "The poet connects her own experiences to that of Job by saying she has suffered like Cyrano and Job, has lost paradise, and dreams of \"creation\"—the creation of new ideas through thought and the fruition of these ideas akin to the whirlwind of Anaxagoras.", "question_group_id": "2139f276-22f6-4034-aa43-4a6467572161", "paragraph_idx": 18, "question_idx": 2}
