The parental influence on\nchildren is something so well recognized and understood that to call\nattention to it sounds much like a banality. However, here an\nextraordinary discovery was made, for in tracing out the feelings and\nemotions of adults it became evident that this influence was paramount\nnot only for children but for adults as well; that the entire direction\nof lives was largely determined quite unconsciously by the parental\nassociations, and that, although adults, the emotional side of their\nnature was still infantile in type and demanded unconsciously the\ninfantile or childish relations.\n\nFreud traces out the commencement of the infantile attachment for the\nparents in this wise.\n\nIn the beginning the child derives its first satisfaction and pleasure\nfrom the mother in the form of nutrition and care for its wants. In this\nfirst act of suckling Freud sees already a kind of sexual pleasure, for\nhe apparently identifies the pleasure principle and the sexual instinct\nand considers that the former is primarily rooted in the latter. At this\nearly time commence such various infantile actions unconnected with\nnutrition as thumbsucking, various movements of the body as rubbing,\nboring, pulling and other manifestations of a definite interest in its\nown body, a delight in nakedness, the pleasure exhibited in inflicting\npain on some object and its opposite, the pleasure from receiving pain.\nAll of these afford the child pleasure and satisfaction, and because\nthey seem analogous to certain perversions in adults they are called by\nFreud the “polymorphous perverse sexuality” of childhood. The character\nof these instinctive actions which have nothing to do with any other\nperson, and through which the child attains pleasure from its own body,\ncaused Freud to term this phase of life as autoerotic after Havelock\nEllis. However, with the growth of the child there is a parallel\ndevelopment of the psychic elements of its sexual nature and now the\nmother, the original object of its love, primarily determined by its\nhelplessness and need, acquires a new valuation. The beginnings of the\nneed for a love object to satisfy the craving or libido of the child are\nearly in evidence and, following along sex lines in general, the little\nson prefers the mother and the daughter the father after the usual\npreference of the parents.\n\nAt this early time children feel deeply the enormous importance of their\nparents and their entire world is bounded by the family circle. All the\nelements of the ego which the child possesses have now become manifest;\nlove, jealousy, curiosity, hate, etc., and those instincts are directed\nin the greatest degree towards the objects of their libido, namely the\nparents. With the growing ego of the child there is a development of\nstrong wishes and desires demanding satisfaction which can only be\ngratified by the mother; therefore there is aroused in the small son the\nfeeling of jealousy and anger towards the father in whom he sees a rival\nfor the affection of the mother and whom he would like to replace. This\ndesire in the soul of the child Freud calls the _Oedipus complex_ in\nrecognition of its analogy to the tragedy of King Oedipus who was drawn\nby his fate to kill his father and win his mother for a wife. Freud\npresents this as the _nuclear complex_ of every neurosis.\n\nAt the basis of this complex, some trace of which can be found in every\nperson, Freud sees a definite incest wish towards the mother which only\nlacks the quality of consciousness. Because of moral reactions this wish\nis quickly subjected to repression through the operation of the “incest\nbarrier,” a postulate he compares to the incest taboo found among\ninferior peoples. At this time the child is beginning to develop its\ntypical sexual curiosity expressed by the question, “Where do I come\nfrom?” The interest and investigation of the child into this problem,\naided by observations and deductions from various actions and attitudes\nof the parents, who have no idea of the watchfulness of the child, lead\nhim, because of his imperfect knowledge and immature development, into\nmany false theories and ideas of birth. These infantile sexual theories\nare held by Freud to be determinative in the development of the child’s\ncharacter and also for the contents of the unconscious as expressed in a\nfuture neurosis.\n\nThese various reactions of the child and his sexual curiosity are\nentirely normal and unavoidable, and if his development proceeds in an\norderly fashion then, at the time of definite object choice he will pass\nsmoothly over from the limitations of the family attachment out into the\nworld and find therein his independent existence.\n\nHowever, if the libido remains fixed on the first chosen object so that\nthe growing individual is unable to tear himself loose from these\nfamilial ties, then the incestuous bond is deepened with the developing\nsexual instinct and its accompanying need of a love object, and the\nentire future of the young personality endangered. For with the\ndevelopment of the incestuous bond the natural repressions deepen\nbecause the moral censor cannot allow these disturbing relations to\nbecome clear to the individual. Therefore, the whole matter is repressed\nmore deeply into the unconscious, and even a feeling of positive enmity\nand repulsion towards the parents is often developed in order to conceal\nand over-compensate for the impossible situation actually present.\n\nThis persistence of the attachment of the libido to the original object,\nand the inability to find in this a suitable satisfaction for the adult\nneed, interferes with the normal development of the psycho-sexual\ncharacter, and it is due to this that the adult retains that\n“infantilism of sexuality” which plays so great a rôle in determining\nthe instability of the emotional life which so frequently leads into the\ndefinite neuroses.\n\n\nThese were the conclusions reached and the ground on which Freudian\npsychology rested, regarding the etiology of the neurosis, and the\ntendencies underlying normal human mechanisms, when Dr. Carl Jung, the\nmost prominent of Freud’s disciples, and the leader of the Zurich\nschool, found himself no longer able to agree with Freud’s findings in\ncertain particulars, although the phenomena which Freud observed and the\ntechnique of psychoanalysis developed by Freud were the material on\nwhich Jung worked and the value of which he clearly emphasizes. The\ndifferences which have developed lay in his understanding and\ninterpretation of the phenomena observed.\n\nBeginning with the conception of libido itself as a term used to connote\nsexual hunger and craving, albeit the meaning of the word sexual was\nextended by Freud to embrace a much wider significance than common usage\nhas assigned it, Jung was unable to confine himself to this limitation.\nHe conceived this longing, this urge or push of life as something\nextending beyond sexuality even in its wider sense. He saw in the term\nlibido a concept of unknown nature, comparable to Bergson’s élan vital,\na hypothetical energy of life, which occupies itself not only in\nsexuality but in various physiological and psychological manifestations\nsuch as growth, development, hunger, and all the human activities and\ninterests. This cosmic energy or urge manifested in the human being he\ncalls libido and compares it with the energy of physics. Although\nrecognizing, in common with Freud as well as with many others, the\nprimal instinct of reproduction as the basis of many functions and\npresent-day activities of mankind no longer sexual in character he\nrepudiates the idea of still calling them sexual, even though their\ndevelopment was a growth originally out of the sexual. Sexuality and its\nvarious manifestations Jung sees as most important channels occupied by\nlibido, but not the exclusive ones through which libido flows.\n\nThis is an energic concept of life; and from this viewpoint this\nhypothetical energy of life or libido is a living power used\ninstinctively by man in all the automatic processes of his functioning;\nsuch very processes being but different manifestations of this energy.\nBy virtue of its quality of mobility and change man, through his\nunderstanding and intelligence, has the power consciously to direct and\nuse his libido in definite and desired ways.\n\nIn this conception of Jung will be seen an analogy to Bergson, who\nspeaks of “this change, this movement and becoming, this self-creation,\ncall it what you will, as the very stuff and reality of our being.”[2]\n\nIn developing the energic conception of libido and separating it from\nFreud’s sexual definition, Jung makes possible the explanation of\ninterest in general, and provides a working concept by which not only\nthe specifically sexual, but the general activities and reactions of man\ncan be understood.\n\nIf a person complains of no longer having interest in his work or of\nlosing interest in his surroundings, then one understands that his\nlibido is withdrawn from this object and that in consequence the object\nitself seems no longer attractive, whereas, as a matter of fact, the\nobject itself is exactly the same as formerly. In other words, it is the\nlibido that we bestow upon an object that makes it attractive and\ninteresting.\n\nThe causes for the withdrawal of libido may be various and are usually\nquite different from those that the persons offer in explanation. It is\nthe task of psychoanalysis to discover the real reasons, which are\nusually hidden and unknown. On the other hand, when an individual\nexhibits an exaggerated interest or places an over-emphasis upon an idea\nor situation, then we know there is too much libido here and that we may\nfind as a consequence a corresponding depletion elsewhere.\n\nThis leads directly into the second point of difference between Jung’s\nviews and those of Freud. This is concerned with those practically\nuniversal childish manifestations of sexuality called by Freud\n“polymorphous perverse” because of their similarity to those\nabnormalities of sexuality which occur in adults and are called\nperversions.\n\nJung takes exception to this viewpoint. He sees in the various\nmanifestations of childhood the precursors or forerunners of the later\nfully developed sexuality, and instead of considering them perverse he\nconsiders them preliminary expressions of sexual coloring. He divides\nhuman life into three stages. The first stage up to about the third or\nfourth year, generally speaking, he calls the presexual stage, for there\nhe sees the libido or life energy occupied chiefly in the functions of\nnutrition and growth, and he draws an analogy between this period and\nthat of the caterpillar stage of the butterfly.\n\nThe second stage includes the years from this time until puberty, and\nthis he speaks of as the prepubertal stage.\n\nThe third period is that from puberty onward and can be considered the\ntime of maturity.\n\nIt is in the earliest stage, the period of which varies greatly in\ndifferent individuals, that are fully inaugurated those various\nmanifestations which have so marked a sexual coloring that there can be\nno question of their relationship, although at that time sexuality in\nthe adult meaning of the word does not exist.\n\nJung explains the polymorphism of these phenomena as arising from a\ngradual movement of the libido from exclusive service in the function of\nnutrition into new avenues which successively open up with the\ndevelopment of the child until the final inauguration of the sexual\nfunction proper at puberty. Normally these childish bad habits are\ngradually relinquished until the libido is entirely withdrawn from these\nimmature phases and with the ushering in of puberty for the first time\n“appears in the form of an undifferentiated sexual primitive power,\nclearly forcing the individual towards division, budding, etc.”\n\nHowever, if in the course of its movement from the function of nutrition\nto the sexual function the libido is arrested or retarded at any phase,\nthen a _fixation_ may result, creating a disturbance in the harmony of\nthe normal development. For, although the libido is retarded and remains\nclinging to some childish manifestation, time goes on and the physical\ngrowth of the child does not stand still. Soon a great contrast is\ncreated between the infantile manifestations of the emotional life and\nthe needs of the more adult individual, and the foundation is thus\nprepared for either the development of a definite neurosis or else for\nthose weaknesses of character or symptomatic disturbances which are not\nsufficiently serious to be called a neurosis.\n\nOne of the most active and important forms of childish libido occupation\nis in phantasy making. The child’s world is one of imagery and\nmake-believe where he can create for himself that satisfaction and\nenjoyment which the world of reality so often denies. As the child grows\nand real demands of life are made upon him it becomes increasingly\nnecessary that his libido be taken away from his phantastic world and\nused for the required adaptation to reality needed by his age and\ncondition, until finally for the adult the freedom of the whole libido\nis necessary to meet the biological and cultural demands of life.\n\nInstead of thus employing the libido in the real world, however, certain\npeople never relinquish the seeking for satisfaction in the shadowy\nworld of phantasy and even though they make certain attempts at\nadaptation they are halted and discouraged by every difficulty and\nobstacle in the path of life and are easily pulled back into their inner\npsychic world. This condition is called a state of _introversion_. It is\nconcerned with the past and the reminiscences which belong thereto.\nSituations and experiences which should have been completed and finished\nlong ago are still dwelt upon and lived with. Images and matters which\nwere once important but which normally have no significance for their\nlater age are still actively influencing their present lives. The nature\nand character of these phantasy products are legion, and are easily\nrecognized in the emotional attitudes and pretensions, the childish\nillusions and exaggerations, the prejudices and inconsistencies which\npeople express in manifold forms. The actual situation is inadequately\nfaced; small matters are reacted towards in an exaggerated manner; or\nelse a frivolous attitude is maintained where real seriousness is\ndemanded. In other words, there is clearly manifested an inadequate\npsychic adaptation towards reality which is quite to be expected from\nthe child, but which is very discordant in the adult.\n\nThe most important of these past influences is that of the parents.\nBecause they are the first objects of the developing childish love, and\nafford the first satisfaction and pleasure to the child, they become the\nmodels for all succeeding efforts, as Freud has worked out. This he\ncalled the _nuclear_ or _root complex_ because this influence was so\npowerful it seemed to be the determining factor in all later\ndifficulties in the life of the individual.\n\nIn this phase of the problem lies the third great difference between\nJung’s interpretation of the observed phenomena and that of Freud.\n\nJung definitely recognizes that there are many neurotic persons who\nclearly exhibited in their childhood the same neurotic tendencies that\nare later exaggerated. Also that an almost overwhelming effect on the\ndestiny of these children is exercised by the influence of the parents,\nthe frequent over-anxiety or tenderness, the lack of sympathy or\nunderstanding, in other words, the complexes of the parent reacting upon\nthe child and producing in him love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate,\nrevolt. The greater the sensitiveness and impressionability of the\nchild, the more he will be stamped with the familial environment, and\nthe more he will unconsciously seek to find again in the world of\nreality the model of his own small world with all the pleasures and\nsatisfactions, or disappointments and unhappinesses with which it was\nfilled.\n\nThis condition to be sure is not a recognized or a conscious one, for\nthe individual may think himself perfectly free from this past influence\nbecause he is living in the real world, and because actually there is a\ngreat difference between the present conditions and that of his childish\npast. He sees all this, intellectually, but there is a wide gap between\nthe intellectual grasp of a situation and the emotional development, and\nit is the latter realm wherein lies the disharmony. However, although\nmany ideas and feelings are connected with the parents, analysis reveals\nvery often that they are only subjective and that in reality they bear\nlittle resemblance to the actual past situation. Therefore, Jung speaks\nno longer of the real father and mother but uses the term imago or image\nto represent the father or mother, because the feelings and phantasies\nfrequently do not deal with the real parents but with the distorted and\nsubjective image created by the imagination of the individual.\n\nFollowing this distinction Jung sees in the Oedipus complex of Freud\nonly a symbol for the “childish desire towards the parents and for the\nconflict which this craving evokes,” and cannot accept the theory that\nin this early stage of childhood the mother has any real sexual\nsignificance for the child.\n\nThe demands of the child upon the mother, the jealousy so often\nexhibited, are at first connected with the rôle of the mother as\nprotector, caretaker and supplier of nutritive wants, and only later,\nwith the germinating eroticism, does the child’s love become admixed\nwith the developing sexual quality. The chief love objects are still the\nparents and he naturally continues to seek and to find in them\nsatisfaction for all his desires. In this way the typical conflict is\ndeveloped which in the son is directed towards the father and in the\ndaughter towards the mother. This jealousy of the daughter towards the\nmother is called the _Electra complex_ from the myth of Electra who took\nrevenge on her mother for the murder of the husband because she was in\nthis way deprived of her father.\n\nNormally as puberty is attained the child gradually becomes more or less\nfreed from his parents, and upon the degree in which this is\naccomplished depends his health and future well-being.\n\nThis demand of nature upon the young individual to free himself from the\nbonds of his childish dependency and to find in the world of reality his\nindependent existence is so imperious and dominating that it frequently\nproduces in the child the greatest struggles and severest conflicts, the\nperiod being characterized symbolically as a _self-sacrifice_ by Jung.\n\nIt frequently happens that the young person is so closely bound in the\nfamily relations that it is only with the greatest difficulty that he\ncan attain any measure of freedom and then only very imperfectly, so\nthat the libido sexualis can only express itself in certain feelings and\nphantasies which clearly reveal the existence of the complex until then\nentirely hidden and unrealized. Now commences the secondary struggle\nagainst the unfilial and immoral feelings with a consequent development\nof intense resistances expressing themselves in irritation, anger,\nrevolt and antagonism against the parents, or else in an especially\ntender, submissive and yielding attitude which over-compensates for the\nrebellion and reaction held within.\n\nThis struggle and conflict gives rise to the unconscious phantasy of\nself-sacrifice which really means the sacrificing of the childish\ntendencies and love type in order to free libido; for his nature demands\nthat he attain the capacity for the accomplishment of his own personal\nfulfilment, the satisfaction of which belongs to the developed man and\nwoman.\n\nThis conception has been worked out in detail by Jung in the book which\nis herein presented to English readers.\n\nWe now come to the most important of Jung’s conceptions in that it bears\npractically upon the treatment of certain types of the neuroses and\nstands theoretically in direct opposition to Freud’s hypothesis. While\nrecognizing fully the influence of the parents and of the sexual\nconstitution of the child, Jung refuses to see in this infantile past\nthe real cause for the later development of the illness. He definitely\nplaces the cause of the pathogenic conflict _in the present moment_ and\nconsiders that in seeking for the cause in the distant past one is only\nfollowing the desire of the patient, which is to withdraw himself as\nmuch as possible from the present important period.\n\nThe conflict is produced by some important task or duty which is\nessential biologically and practically for the fulfilment of the ego of\nthe individual, but before which an obstacle arises from which he\nshrinks, and thus halted cannot go on. With this interference in the\npath of progression libido is stored up and a _regression_ takes place\nwhereby there occurs a reanimation of past ways of libido occupation\nwhich were entirely normal to the child, but which for the adult are no\nlonger of value. These regressive infantile desires and phantasies now\nalive and striving for satisfaction are converted into symptoms, and in\nthese surrogate forms obtain a certain gratification, thus creating the\nexternal manifestations of the neurosis. Therefore Jung does not ask\nfrom what psychic experience or point of fixation in childhood the\npatient is suffering, but what is the present duty or task he is\navoiding, or what obstacle in his life’s path he is unable to overcome?\nWhat is the cause of his regression to past psychic experiences?\n\nFollowing this theory Jung expresses the view that the elaborate\nphantasies and dreams produced by these patients are really forms of\ncompensation or artificial substitutes for the unfulfilled adaptation to\nreality. The sexual content of these phantasies and dreams is only\napparently and not actually expressive of a real sexual desire or incest\nwish, but is a regressive employment of sexual forms to symbolically\nexpress a present-day need when the attainment of the present ego demand\nseems too difficult or impossible, and no adaptation is made to what is\npossible for the individual’s capability.[3]\n\nWith this statement Jung throws a new light on the work of analytic\npsychology and on the conception of the neurotic symptoms, and renders\npossible of understanding the many apparent incongruities and\nconflicting observations which have been so disturbing to the critics.\n\n\nIt now becomes proper to ask what has been established by all this mass\nof investigation into the soul, and what is its value not only as a\ntherapeutic measure for the neurotic sufferer, but also for the normal\nhuman being?\n\nFirst and perhaps most important is the recognition of a definite\npsychological determinism. Instead of human life being filled with\nfoolish, meaningless or purposeless actions, errors and thoughts, it can\nbe demonstrated that no expression or manifestation of the psyche,\nhowever trifling or inconsistent in appearance, is really lawless or\nunmotivated. Only a possession of the technique is necessary in order to\nreveal, to any one desirous of knowing, the existence of the unconscious\ndeterminants of his mannerisms, trivial expressions, acts and behavior,\ntheir purpose and significance.\n\nThis leads into the second fundamental conception, which is perhaps even\nless considered than the foregoing, and that is the relative value of\nthe conscious mind and thought. It is the general attitude of people to\njudge themselves by their surface motives, to satisfy themselves by\nsaying or thinking “this is what I want to do or say” or “I intended to\ndo thus and so,” but somehow what one thought, one intended to say or\nexpected to do is very often the contrary of what actually is said or\ndone. Every one has had these experiences when the gap between the\nconscious thought and action was gross enough to be observed. It is also\na well known experience to consciously desire something very much and\nwhen it is obtained to discover that this in no wise satisfied or\nlessened the desire, which was then transferred to some other object.\nThus one became cognizant of the fact that the feeling and idea\npresented by consciousness as the desire was an error. What is the\ndifficulty in these conditions? Evidently some other directing force\nthan that of which we are aware is at work.\n\nDr. G. Stanley Hall uses a very striking symbol when he compares the\nmind to an iceberg floating in the ocean with one-eighth visible above\nthe water and seven-eighths below—the one-eighth above being that part\ncalled conscious and the seven-eighths below that which we call the\nunconscious. The influence and controlling power of the unconscious\ndesires over our thoughts and acts are in this relative proportion.\nFaint glimmers of other motives and interests than those we accept or\nwhich we believe, often flit into consciousness. These indications, if\nstudied or valued accurately, would lead to the realization that\nconsciousness is but a single stage and but one form of expression of\nmind. Therefore its dictum is but one, often untrustworthy, approach to\nthe great question as to what is man’s actual psychic accomplishment,\nand as to what in particular is the actual soul development of the\nindividual.\n\nA further contribution of equal importance has been the empiric\ndevelopment of a dynamic theory of life; the conception that life is in\na state of flux—movement—leading either to construction or destruction.\nThrough the development man has reached he has attained the power by\nmeans of his intelligence and understanding of definitely directing to a\ncertain extent this life energy or libido into avenues which serve his\ninterest and bring a real satisfaction for the present day.\n\nWhen man through ignorance and certain inherent tendencies fails to\nrecognize his needs or his power to fulfil them, or to adapt himself to\nthe conditions of reality of the present time, there is then produced\nthat reanimation of infantile paths by which an attempt is made to gain\nfulfilment or satisfaction through the production of symptoms or\nattitudes.\n\nThe acceptance of these statements demands the recognition of the\nexistence of an infantile sexuality and the large part played by it in\nthe later life of the individual. Because of the power and imperious\ninfluence exerted by the parents upon the child, and because of the\nunconscious attachment of his libido to the original object, the mother,\nand the perseverance of this first love model in the psyche, he finds it\nvery difficult, on reaching the stage of adult development and the time\nfor seeking a love object outside of the family, to gain a satisfactory\nmodel.\n\nIt is exceedingly important for parents and teachers to recognize the\nrequirements of nature, which, beginning with puberty, imperiously\ndemand of the young individual a separation of himself from the parent\nstem and the development of an independent existence. In our complex\nmodern civilization this demand of nature is difficult enough of\nachievement for the child who has the heartiest and most intelligent\nco-operation of his parents and environment—but for the one who has not\nonly to contend with his own inner struggle for his freedom but has in\naddition the resistance of his parents who would hold him in his\nchildhood at any cost, because they cannot endure the thought of his\nseparation from them, the task becomes one of the greatest magnitude. It\nis during this period when the struggle between the childish inertia and\nnature’s urge becomes so keen, that there occur the striking\nmanifestations of jealousy, criticism, irritability all usually directed\nagainst the parents, of defiance of parental authority, of runaways and\nvarious other psychic and nervous disorders known to all.\n\nThis struggle, which is the first great task of mankind and the one\nwhich requires the greatest effort, is that which is expressed by Jung\nas the self-sacrifice motive—the sacrifice of the childish feelings and\ndemands, and of the irresponsibility of this period, and the assumption\nof the duties and tasks of an individual existence.\n\nIt is this great theme which Jung sees as the real motive lying hidden\nin the myths and religions of man from the beginning, as well as in the\nliterature and artistic creations of both ancient and modern time, and\nwhich he works out with the greatest wealth of detail and painstaking\neffort in the book herewith presented.\n\nThis necessitates a recognition and revaluation of the enormous\nimportance and influence of the ego and the sexual instinct upon the\nthought and reaction of man, and also predicates a displacement of the\npsychological point of gravity from the will and intellect to the realm\nof the emotions and feelings. The desired end is a synthesis of these\ntwo paths or the use of the intellect constructively in the service of\nthe emotions in order to gain for the best interest of the individual\nsome sort of co-operative reaction between the two.\n\nNo one dealing with analytic psychology can fail to be struck by the\ntremendous and unnecessary burdens which man has placed upon himself,\nand how greatly he has increased the difficulties of adaptation by his\nrigid intellectual views and moral formulas, and by his inability to\nadmit to himself that he is actually just a human being imperfect, and\ncontaining within himself all manner of tendencies, good and bad, all\nstriving for some satisfactory goal. Further, that the refusal to see\nhimself in this light instead of as an ideal person in no way alters the\nactual condition, and that in fact, through the cheap pretense of being\nable only to consider himself as a very virtuous person, or as shocked\nand hurt when observing the “sins” of others, he actually is prevented\nfrom developing his own character and bringing his own capacities to\ntheir fullest expressions.\n\nThere is frequently expressed among people the idea of how fortunate it\nis that we cannot see each other’s thoughts, and how disturbing it would\nbe if our real feelings could be read. But what is so shameful in these\nsecrets of the soul? They are in reality our own egoistic desires all\nstriving, longing, wishing for satisfaction, for happiness; those\ndesires which instinctively crave their own gratification but which can\nonly be really fulfilled by adapting them to the real world and to the\nsocial group.\n\nWhy is it that it is so painful for man to admit that the prime\ninfluence in all human endeavor is found in the ego itself, in its\ndesires, wishes, needs and satisfactions, in short, in its need for\nself-expression and self-perpetuation, the evolutionary impetus in life?\n\nThe basis for the unpleasantness of this idea may perhaps be found in an\ninner resistance in nature itself which forces man to include others in\nhis scheme, lest his own greedy desires should serve to destroy him. But\neven with this inner demand and all the ethical and moral teachings of\ncenturies it is everywhere evident that man has only very imperfectly\nlearned that it is to his own interest to consider his neighbor and that\nit is impossible for him to ignore the needs of the body social of which\nhe is a part. Externally, the recognition of the strength of the ego\nimpulse is objectionable because of the ideal conception that\nself-striving and so-called selfish seeking are unworthy, ignoble and\nincompatible with a desirable character and must be ignored at all cost.\n\nThe futility of this attitude is to be clearly seen in the failure after\nall these centuries to even approximate it, as evidenced in our human\nrelations and institutions, and is quite as ineffectual in this realm as\nin that of sexuality where the effort to overcome this imperious\ndomination has been attempted by lowering the instinct, and seeing in it\nsomething vile or unclean, something unspeakable and unholy. Instead of\ndestroying the power of sexuality this struggle has only warped and\ndistorted, injured and mutilated the expression; for not without\ndestruction of the individual can these fundamental instincts be\ndestroyed. Life itself has needs and imperiously demands expression\nthrough the forms created. All nature answers to this freely and simply\nexcept man. His failure to recognize himself as an instrument through\nwhich the life energy is coursing and the demands of which must be\nobeyed, is the cause of his misery. Despite his possession of intellect\nand self-consciousness, he cannot without disaster to himself refuse the\ntasks of life and the fulfilment of his own needs. Man’s great task is\nthe adaptation of himself to reality and the recognition of himself as\nan instrument for the expression of life according to his individual\npossibilities.\n\nIt is in his privilege as a self-creator that his highest purpose is\nfound.\n\nThe value of self-consciousness lies in the fact that man is enabled to\nreflect upon himself and learn to understand the true origin and\nsignificance of his actions and opinions, that he may adequately value\nthe real level of his development and avoid being self-deceived and\ntherefore inhibited from finding his biological adaptation. He need no\nlonger be unconscious of the motives underlying his actions or hide\nhimself behind a changed exterior, in other words, be merely a series of\nreactions to stimuli as the mechanists have it, but he may to a certain\nextent become a self-creating and self-determining being.\n\nIndeed, there seems to be an impulse towards adaptation quite as Bergson\nsees it, and it would seem to be a task of the highest order to use\nintelligence to assist one’s self to work with this impulse.\n\n\nThrough the investigation of these different avenues leading into the\nhidden depths of the human being and through the revelation of the\nmotives and influences at work there, although astonishing to the\nuninitiated, a very clear and definite conception of the actual human\nrelationship—brotherhood—of all mankind is obtained. It is this\nrecognition of these common factors basically inherent in humanity from\nthe beginning and still active, which is at once both the most hopeful\nand the most feared and disliked part of psychoanalysis.\n\nIt is disliked by those individuals who have prided themselves upon\ntheir superiority and the distinction between their reactions and\nmotives and those of ordinary mankind. In other words, they attempt to\nbecome personalities through elevating themselves and lowering others,\nand it is a distinct blow to discover that beneath these pretensions lie\nthe very ordinary elements shared in common by all. On the other hand,\nto those who have been able to recognize their own weaknesses and have\nsuffered in the privacy of their own souls, the knowledge that these\nthings have not set them apart from others, but that they are the common\nproperty of all and that no one can point the finger of scorn at his\nfellow, is one of the greatest experiences of life and is productive of\nthe greatest relief.\n\nIt is feared by many who realize that in these painfully acquired\nrepressions and symptoms lie their safety and their protection from\ndirectly facing and dealing with tendencies and characteristics with\nwhich they feel unable to cope. The repression and the accompanying\nsymptoms indicate a difficulty and a struggle, and in this way are a\nsort of compromise or substitute formation which permit, although only\nin a wasteful and futile manner, the activity of the repressed\ntendencies. Nevertheless, to analyze the individual back to his original\ntendencies and reveal to him the meaning of these substitute formations\nwould be a useless procedure in which truly “the last state of that man\nwould be worse than the first” if the work ceased there. The aim is not\nto destroy those barriers upon which civilized man has so painfully\nclimbed and to reduce him to his primitive state, but, where these have\nfailed or imperfectly succeeded, to help him to attain his greatest\npossibilities with less expenditure of energy, by less wasteful methods\nthan nature provides. In this achievement lies the hopeful and valuable\nside of this method—the development of the synthesis. It is hopeful\nbecause now a way is opened to deal with these primitive tendencies\nconstructively, and render their effects not only harmless but useful,\nby utilizing them in higher aims, socially and individually valuable and\nsatisfactory.\n\nThis is what has occurred normally in those individuals who seem capable\nand constructive personalities; in those creative minds that give so\nmuch to the race. They have converted certain psychological tendencies\nwhich could have produced useless symptoms or destructive actions into\nvaluable productions. Indeed it is not uncommon for strong, capable\npersons to state themselves that they knew they could have been equally\ncapable of a wasteful or destructive life. This utilization of the\nenergy or libido freed by removing the repressions and the lifting of\ninfantile tendencies and desires into higher purposes and directions\nsuitable for the individual at his present status is called\n_sublimation_.\n\nIt must not be understood by this discussion that geniuses or wonderful\npersonalities can be created through analysis, for this is not the aim\nof the procedure. Its purpose is to remove the inhibitions and\nrestrictions which interfere with the full development of the\npersonality, to help individuals attain to that level where they really\nbelong, and to prepare people to better understand and meet life whether\nthey are neurotic sufferers or so-called “normal people” with the\ndifficulties and peculiarities which belong to all.\n\nThis reasoning and method of procedure is only new when the application\nis made to the human being.

  "missed_text": "Psychology of the Unconscious by Jung AN INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOANALYSIS AND ANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY When Professor Freud of Vienna made his early discoveries in the realm of the neuroses, and announced that the basis and origin of the various symptoms grouped under the terms hysteria and neuroses lay in unfulfilled desires and wishes, unexpressed and unknown to the patient for the most part, and concerned chiefly with the sexual instinct, it was not realized what far-reaching influence this unpopular and bitterly attacked theory would exert on the understanding of human life in general. For this theory has so widened in its scope that its application has now extended beyond a particular group of pathologic states. It has in fact led to a new evaluation of the whole conduct of human life; a new comprehension has developed which explains those things which formerly were unexplained, and there is offered an understanding not only of the symptoms of a neurosis and the phenomena of conduct but the product of the mind as expressed in myths and religions. This amazing growth has proceeded steadily in an ever-widening fashion despite opposition as violent as any of which we have knowledge in the past. The criticism originally directed towards the little understood and much disliked sexual conception now includes the further teachings of a psychology which by the application to it of such damning phrases as mystical, metaphysical and sacrilegious, is condemned as unscientific. To add to the general confusion and misunderstanding surrounding this new school of thought there has arisen a division amongst the leaders themselves, so that there now exist two schools led respectively by Professor Sigmund Freud of Vienna and Dr. Carl Jung of Zurich, referred to in the literature as the Vienna School and the Zurich School. It is very easy to understand that criticism and opposition should develop against a psychology so difficult of comprehension, and so disturbing to the ideas which have been held by humanity for ages; a psychology which furthermore requires a special technique as well as an observer trained to recognize and appreciate in psychologic phenomena a verification of the statement that there is no such thing as chance, and that every act and every expression has its own meaning, determined by the inner feelings and wishes of the individual. It is not a simple matter to come out boldly and state that every individual is to a large extent the determiner of his own destiny, for only by poets and philosophers has this idea been put forth—not by science; and it is a brave act to make this statement with full consciousness of all its meaning, and to stand ready to prove it by scientific reasoning and procedure. Developed entirely through empirical investigation and through an analysis of individual cases, Freudian psychology seems particularly to belong to that conception of Max Müller’s that “An empirical acquaintance with facts rises to a scientific knowledge of facts as soon as the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity of single productions the unity of an organic system.”[1] Psychoanalysis is the name given to the method developed for reaching down into the hidden depths of the individual to bring to light the underlying motives and determinants of his symptoms and attitudes, and to reveal the unconscious tendencies which lie behind actions and reactions and which influence development and determine the relations of life itself. The result of digging down into the hidden psyche has been to produce a mass of material from below the threshold of consciousness, so astonishing and disturbing and out of relation with the previously held values, as to arouse in any one unfamiliar with the process the strongest antagonism and criticism. Although originally studied only as a therapeutic method for the sick it was soon realized through an analysis of normal people how slight were the differences in the content of the unconscious of the sick and of the normal. The differences observed were seen to be rather in the reactions to life and to the conflicts produced by contending forces in the individual. These conflicts, usually not fully perceived by the individual, and having to do with objectionable desires and wishes that are not in keeping with the conscious idea of self, produce marked effects which are expressed either in certain opinions, prejudices, attitudes of conduct, faulty actions, or in some definite pathologic symptom. As Dr. Jung says, he who remains healthy has to struggle with the same complexes that cause the neurotic to fall ill. In a valuable book called “The Neighbor,” written by the late Professor N. Shaler of Harvard University, there occurs this very far-reaching statement: “It is hardly too much to say that all the important errors of conduct, all the burdens of men or of societies are caused by the inadequacies in the association of the primal animal emotions with those mental powers which have been so rapidly developed in mankind.” This statement, reached by a process of reasoning and a method of thought and study entirely different from psychoanalysis, nevertheless so completely expresses in brief form the very basis of the postulates developed through psychoanalysis that I quote it here. Such a statement made in the course of a general examination of human relations does not arouse opposition nor seem to be so difficult of acceptance. It appears to be the individual application of these conceptions that has roused such bitter antagonism and violent denunciations. Rightly understood and used, psychoanalysis may be compared to surgery, for psychoanalysis stands in the same relation to the personality as surgery does to the body, and they aim at parallel results. It is well recognized that in the last analysis nature is the real physician, the healer of wounds; but prior to the development of our modern asepsis and surgical technique the healing produced by nature was most often of a very faulty and imperfect type—hideous scars, distorted and crippled limbs, with functions impaired or incapacitated, resulted from the wounds, or else nature was unable to cope with the hurt and the injured one succumbed. Science has been steadily working for centuries with the aim of understanding nature and finding means to aid and co-operate with her so that healing could take place with the least possible loss of function or permanent injury to the individual. Marvelous results have rewarded these persistent efforts, as the brilliant achievements of surgery plainly indicate. Meantime, however, little thought was given to the possibility of any scientific method being available to help man overcome the wounds and conflicts taking place in his soul, hurts which retarded his development and progress as a personality, and which frequently in the struggle resulted in physical pains and symptoms of the most varied character. That was left solely to religion and metaphysics. Now, however, this same assistance that surgery has given to the physical body, psychoanalysis attempts to give to the personality. That it cannot always succeed is as much to be expected, and more, than that surgery does not always succeed, for the analytic work requires much of the individual. No real result can be attained if he has not already developed a certain quality of character and intelligence which makes it possible for him to submit himself to a facing of his naked soul, and to the pain and suffering which this often entails. Here, as in no other relation in life, an absolute truth and an absolute honesty are the only basis of action, since deception of any kind deceives no one but the individual himself and acts as a boomerang, defeating his own aims. Such deep searching and penetrating into the soul is not something to be undertaken lightly nor to be considered a trivial or simple matter, and the fact is that where a strong compulsion is lacking, such as sickness or a situation too difficult to meet, much courage is required to undertake it. In order to understand this psychology which is pervading all realms of thought and seems destined to be a new psychological-philosophical system for the understanding and practical advancement of human life, it will be necessary to go somewhat into detail regarding its development and present status. For in this new direction lies its greatest value and its greatest danger. The beginnings of this work were first published in 1895 in a book entitled “Studien über Hysterie,” and contained the joint investigations into hysteria of Dr. Breuer of Vienna and his pupil Dr. Sigmund Freud. The results of their investigations seemed to show that the various symptoms grouped under the title of hysteria were the result of emotionally colored reminiscences which, all unknown to the conscious waking self, were really actively expressing themselves through the surrogate form of symptoms and that these experiences, although forgotten by the patient, could be reproduced and the emotional content discharged. Hypnosis was the means used to enable the physician to penetrate deeply into the forgotten memories, for it was found through hypnosis that these lost incidents and circumstances were not really lost at all but only dropped from consciousness, and were capable of being revived when given the proper stimuli. The astonishing part about it was that with the revival of these memories and their accompanying painful and disturbing emotions, the symptoms disappeared. This led naturally to the conclusion that these symptoms were dependent upon some emotional disturbance or psychic trauma which had been inadequately expressed, and that in order to cure the patient one merely had to establish the connection between the memory and the emotions which properly belonged to it, letting the emotion work itself out through a reproduction of the forgotten scene. With further investigation Freud found that hypnosis was unnecessary for the revival of the forgotten experiences, and that it was possible to obtain the lost emotional material in the conscious and normal state. For this purpose the patient was encouraged to assume a passive, non-critical attitude and simply let his thoughts flow, speaking of whatever came into his mind, holding nothing back. During this free and easy discussion of his life and conditions, directed by the law of association of ideas, reference was invariably made to the experiences or thoughts which were the most affective and disturbing elements. It was seen to be quite impossible to avoid this indirect revelation because of the strength of the emotions surrounding these ideas and the effect of the conscious wish to repress unpleasant feelings. This important group of ideas or impressions, with the feelings and emotions clustered around them which are betrayed through this process, was called by Jung a _complex_. However, with the touching of the _complex_ which always contains feelings and emotions so painful or unpleasant as to be unacceptable to consciousness, and which are therefore repressed and hidden, great difficulties appeared, for very often the patient came to a sudden stop and could apparently recall nothing more. Memory gaps were frequent, relations twisted, etc. Evidently some force banished these memories so that the person was quite honest in saying that he could remember nothing or that there was nothing to tell. This kind of forgetfulness was called _repression_, and is the normal mechanism by which nature protects the individual from such painful feelings as are caused by unpleasant and unacceptable experiences and thoughts, the recognition of his egoistic nature, and the often quite unbearable conflict of his weaknesses with his feelings of idealism. At this early time great attention was given towards developing a technique which would render more easy the reproduction of these forgotten memories, for with the abandonment of hypnosis it was seen that some unknown active force was at work which not only banished painful memories and feelings, but also prevented their return; this was called _resistance_. This resistance was found to be the important mechanism which interfered with a free flow of thought and produced the greatest difficulty in the further conduct of the analysis. It appeared under various guises and frequently manifested itself in intellectual objections based on reasoning ground, in criticism directed towards the analyst, or in criticism of the method itself, and finally, often in a complete blocking of expression, so that until the resistance was broken nothing more could be produced. It was necessary then to find some aid by which these resistances could be overcome and the repressed memories and feelings revived and set free. For it was proven again and again that even though the person was not at all aware of concealing within himself some emotionally disturbing feeling or experience with which his symptoms were associated, yet such was the fact, and that under proper conditions this material could be brought into consciousness. This realm where these unknown but disturbing emotions were hidden was called the “Unconscious”—the “Unconscious” also being a name used arbitrarily to indicate all that material of which the person is not aware at the given time—the not-conscious. This term is used very loosely in Freudian psychology and is not intended to provoke any academic discussion but to conform strictly to the dictionary classification of a “negative concept which can neither be described nor defined.” To say that an idea or feeling is unconscious merely means to indicate that the individual is unaware at that time of its existence, or that all the material of which he is unaware at a given time is unconscious. With the discovery of the significance in relation to hysteria of these varied experiences and forgotten memories which always led into the erotic realm and usually were carried far back into early childhood, the theory of an infantile sexual trauma as a cause of this neurosis developed. Contrary to the usual belief that children have no sexuality and that only at puberty does it suddenly arise, it was definitely shown that there was a very marked kind of sexuality among children of the most tender years, entirely instinctive and capable of producing a grave effect on the entire later life. However, further investigations carried into the lives of normal people disclosed quite as many psychic and sexual traumas in their early childhood as in the lives of the patients; therefore, the conception of the “infantile sexual trauma” as the etiological factor was abandoned in favor of “the infantilism of sexuality” itself. In other words, it was soon realized that many of the sexual traumas which were placed in their early childhood by these patients, did not really exist except in their own phantasies and probably were produced as a defence against the memories of their own childish sexual activities. These experiences led to a deep investigation into the nature of the child’s sexuality and developed the ideas which Freud incorporated in a work called “Three Contributions to the Sexual Theory.” He found so many variations and manifestations of sexual activity even among young children that he realized that this activity was the normal, although entirely unconscious, expression of the child’s developing life, and while not comparable to the adult sexuality, nevertheless produced a very definite influence and effect on the child’s life. These childish expressions of this instinct he called “polymorphous perverse,” because in many ways they resembled the various abnormalities called perversions when found among adults under certain conditions. In the light of these additional investigations Freud was led to change his formulation, for instead of the symptoms of the neurotic patient being due to definite sexual experiences, they seemed to be determined by his reactions towards his own sexual constitution and the kind of repression to which these instincts were subjected. Perhaps one of the greatest sources of misunderstanding and difficulty in this whole subject lies in the term sexuality, for Freud’s conception of this is entirely different from that of the popular sense. He conceives sexuality to be practically synonymous with the word _love_ and to include under this term all those tender feelings and emotions which have had their origin in a primitive erotic source, even if now their primary aim is entirely lost and another substituted for it. It must also be borne in mind that Freud strictly emphasizes the psychic side of sexuality and its importance, as well as the somatic expression. Therefore, to understand Freud’s theories, his very broad conception of the term sexual must never be forgotten. Through this careful investigation of the psychic life of the individual, the tremendous influence and importance of phantasy-making for the fate was definitely shown. It was discovered that the indulgence in day-dreams and phantasies was practically universal not only among children but among adults, that even whole lives were being lived out in a phantastic world created by the dreamer, a world wherein he could fulfil all those wishes and desires which were found to be too difficult or impossible to satisfy in the world of reality. Much of this phantasy thinking was seen to be scarcely conscious, but arose from unrealized wishes, desires and strivings which could only express themselves through veiled symbols in the form of phantastic structures not understood, nor fully recognized. Indeed, it is perhaps one of the most common human experiences to find “queer thoughts,” undesired ideas and images, forcing themselves upon one’s attention to such an extent that the will has to be employed to push them out of mind. It is not unusual to discover long-forgotten impressions of childhood assuming a phantastic shape in memory, and dwelt upon as though they were still of importance. This material afforded a rich field for the searchers into the soul, for through the operation of the law of association of ideas these phantastic products, traced back to their origin, revealed the fact that instead of being meaningless or foolish, they were produced by a definite process, and arose from distinct wishes and desires which unconsciously veiled themselves in these mysterious forms and pictures. It is conceded that the most completely unconscious product of an individual is his dream, and therefore Professor Freud turned his attention from phantasies and day-dreams to the investigation of the nightly dreams of his patients to discover whether they would throw light upon the painful feelings and ideas repressed out of consciousness, and therefore inaccessible to direct revelation. This brilliant idea soon led to a rich fruiting, for it became evident that contrary to the usual conception that the dream is a phantastic and absurd jumble of heterogeneous fragments, having no real relation to the life of the individual, it is full of meaning. In fact, it is usually concerned with the problem of life most pressing at the time, which expresses itself not directly, but in symbolic form so as to be unrecognized. In this way the individual gains an expression and fulfilment of his unrealized wish or desire. This discovery of the symbolic nature of the dream and the phantasy was brought about entirely through the associative method and developed empirically through investigations of the dreams of many people. In this manner it became evident that certain ideas and objects which recurred again and again in the dreams and phantasies of different people were definitely associated with certain unconscious or unrecognized wishes and desires, and were repeatedly used by the mind to express these meanings where a direct form was repressed and unallowed. Thus certain dream expressions and figures were in a general way considered to be rather definite symbols of these repressed ideas and feelings found in the unconscious. Through a comparative and parallel study it soon appeared that there was a similar mechanism at work in myths and fairy tales and that the relationship between the dreams and phantasies of an individual and the myths and folk tales of a people was so close that Abraham could say that the myth is a fragment of the infantile soul life of the race and the dream is the myth of the individual. Thus through relating his dreams the patient himself furnished the most important means of gaining access to the unconscious and disturbing complexes with which his symptoms were connected. Besides the dream analysis the patient furnished other means of revelation of his complexes—his mannerisms and unconscious acts, his opening remarks to his physician, his emotional reactions to certain ideas; in short the whole behavior and verbal expressions of the individual reveal his inner nature and problems. Through all this work it became clear that in the emotional nature lay the origin not only of the various nervous illnesses themselves, but also of the isolated symptoms and individual idiosyncrasies and peculiarities which are the part of all humanity and that the pathogenic cause of the disturbances lies not in the ignorance of individuals, but in those inner resistances which are the underlying basis of this ignorance. Therefore the aim of the therapy became not merely the relief of the ignorance but the searching out and combating of these resistances. It becomes evident from even this brief description of the analytic procedure that we are dealing with a very complex and delicate material, and with a technique which needs to make definite use of all influences available for the help of the patient. It has long been recognized that the relation established between physician and patient has a great effect upon the medical assistance which he is able to render—in other words, if a confidence and personal regard developed in the patient towards the physician, the latter’s advice was just so much more efficacious. This personal feeling has been frankly recognized and made of distinct service in psychoanalytic treatment under the name of _transference_. It is through the aid of this definite relationship which must be established in the one being analyzed towards the analyst that it is possible to deal with the unconscious and organized resistances which so easily blind the individual and render the acceptance of the new valuations very difficult to the raw and sensitive soul. Freud’s emphasis upon the rôle of the sexual instinct in the production of the neurosis and also in its determining power upon the personality of the normal individual does not imply that he does not also recognize other determinants at the root of human conduct, as for instance, the instinct for preservation of life and the ego principle itself. But these motives are not so violently forbidden and repressed as the sexual impulse, and therefore, because of that repressive force and the strength of the impulse he considers this primary in its influence upon the human being. The importance of this instinct upon human life is clearly revealed by the great place given to it under the name of love in art, literature, poetry, romance and all beauty from the beginning of recorded time. Viewed in this light it cannot seem extraordinary that a difficulty or disturbance in this emotional field should produce such far-reaching consequences for the individual. The sexual impulse is often compared with that of hunger, and this craving and need lying in all humanity is called by Freud _libido_.",
