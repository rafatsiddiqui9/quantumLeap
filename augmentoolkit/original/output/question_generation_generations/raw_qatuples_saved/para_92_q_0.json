    "paragraph": "In this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question whether the well-known longing for reality of the paranoic dement (and the dementia pr\u00e6cox patients),[245] to whom I have especially called attention in my book, \u201cThe Psychology of Dementia Pr\u00e6cox,\u201d[246] is to be traced back to the withdrawal of the \u201clibidinous affluxes\u201d alone, or whether this coincides with the so-called objective interest in general. It is hardly to be assumed that the normal \u201cfonction du r\u00e9el\u201d (Janet)[247] is maintained only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest. The fact is that in very many cases reality disappears entirely, so that not a trace of psychological adaptation or orientation can be recognized. Reality is repressed under these circumstances and replaced by the contents of the complex. One must of necessity say that not only the erotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared, that is to say, the whole adaptation to reality has ceased. To this category belong the stuporose and catatonic automatons.",
