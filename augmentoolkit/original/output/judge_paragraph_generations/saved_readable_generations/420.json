{"paragraph": "After this prologue in the second song, the hero\u2019s previous history is related. The great warrior, Mudjekeewis (Hiawatha\u2019s father), has cunningly overcome the great bear, \u201cthe terror of the nations,\u201d and stolen from him the magic \u201cbelt of wampum,\u201d a girdle of shells. Here we meet the motive of the \u201ctreasure attained with difficulty,\u201d which the hero rescues from the monster. Who the bear is, is shown by the poet\u2019s comparisons. Mudjekeewis strikes the bear on his head after he has robbed him of the treasure.\u201cWith the heavy blow bewildered         Rose the great Bear of the mountains,         But his knees beneath him trembled,         And he whimpered _like a woman_.\u201dMudjekeewis said derisively to him:\u201cElse you would not cry, and whimper,         Like a _miserable woman_!\u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7    \u00b7But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,         And disgrace your tribe by crying,         Like a wretched Shaugodaya,         Like a _cowardly old woman_!\u201d", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
