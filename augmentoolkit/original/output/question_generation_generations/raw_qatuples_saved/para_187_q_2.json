    "paragraph": "These examples, which allow us to recognize a clear sexual symbolism in the generation of fire, prove, therefore, since they originate from different times and different peoples, the existence of a universal tendency to credit to fire production not only a magical but also a sexual significance. This ceremonial or magic repetition of this very ancient, long-outlived observance shows how insistently the human mind clings to the old forms, and how deeply rooted is this very ancient reminiscence of fire boring. One might almost be inclined to see in the sexual symbolism of fire production a relatively late addition to the priestly lore. This may, indeed, be true for the ceremonial elaboration of the fire mysteries, but whether originally the generation of fire was in general a sexual action, that is to say, a \u201ccoitus-play,\u201d is still a question. That similar things occur among very primitive people we learn from the Australian tribe of the Watschandies,[302] who in the spring perform the following magic ceremonies of fertilization: They dig a hole in the ground, so formed and surrounded with bushes as to counterfeit a woman\u2019s genitals. They dance the night long around this hole; in connection with this they hold spears in front of themselves in a manner to recall the penis in erection. They dance around the hole and thrust their spears into the ditch, while they cry to it, \u201cPulli nira, pulli nira, _wataka_!\u201d (Non fossa, non fossa, sed cunnus!) Such obscene dances appear among other primitive races as well.[303]",

    "question": "What does the author's mention of the Watschandies tribe reveal about the persistence of ancient fire-related rituals?\n\n**ANSISWER:**\nThe Watschandies tribe's spring magic ceremonies of fertilization, which involve digging a hole and performing dances that resemble sexual acts, reveal the persistence of ancient fire-related rituals. These ceremonies, which counterfeited a woman\u2019s genitals and involved acts that mimicked the penis in erection, show how deeply rooted and consistently performed these ancient rituals were, even among very primitive peoples.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the author\u2019s hypothesis about the original nature of the act of generating fire, and how do primitive tribes support this hypothesis?",
    "answer": "The author hypothesizes that the original act of generating fire may not have been inherently sexual. To support this, the author cites examples from primitive tribes, such as the Watschandies, who perform ceremonies involving acts that mimic sexual intercourse. This suggests that while the sexual symbolism may have been added later, the act of fire generation itself might have originally been a non-sexual action.",
