    "paragraph": "The chief source of the history of the analytic conception of libido is Freud\u2019s \u201cThree Contributions to the Sexual Theory.\u201d There the term libido is conceived by him in the original narrow sense of sexual impulse, sexual need. Experience forces us to the assumption of a capacity for displacement of the libido, because functions or localizations of non-sexual force are undoubtedly capable of taking up a certain amount of libidinous sexual impetus, a libidinous afflux.[238] Functions or objects could, therefore, obtain sexual value, which under normal circumstances really have nothing to do with sexuality.[239] From this fact results the Freudian comparison of the libido with a stream, which is divisible, which can be dammed up, which overflows into branches, and so on.[240] Freud\u2019s original conception does not interpret \u201ceverything sexual,\u201d although this has been asserted by critics, but recognizes the existence of certain forces, the nature of which are not well known; to which Freud, however, compelled by the notorious facts which are evident to any layman, grants the capacity to receive \u201caffluxes of libido.\u201d The hypothetical idea at the basis is the symbol of the \u201cTriebb\u00fcndel\u201d[241] (bundle of impulses), wherein the sexual impulse figures as a partial impulse of the whole system, and its encroachment into the other realms of impulse is a fact of experience. The theory of Freud, branching off from this interpretation, according to which the motor forces of a neurotic system correspond precisely to their libidinous additions to other (non-sexual) functional impulses, has been sufficiently proven as correct, it seems to me, by the work of Freud and his school.[242] Since the appearance of the \u201cThree Contributions,\u201d in 1905, a change has taken place[243] in the libido conception; its field of application has been widened. An extremely clear example of this amplification is this present work.",

    "question": "What does the \"Triebb\u00fcndel\" (bundle of impulses) symbolize in Freud's theory?",
    "answer": "The \"Triebb\u00fcndel\" (bundle of impulses) in Freud's theory symbolizes a system where the sexual impulse is seen as a partial impulse of the whole system. It is a concept that acknowledges the reality of the sexual impulse encroaching upon and integrating with other realms of impulses, reflecting the experience of such encroachment.",
