The\ndeath of Balder, quite analogous to the death of Osiris (attack of\nsickness of Rê), because of the wounding by the branch of the mistletoe,\nseems to need a similar explanation. It is recounted in the myth how all\ncreatures were pledged not to hurt Balder, save only the mistletoe,\nwhich was forgotten, presumably because it was too young. This killed\nBalder. Mistletoe is a parasite. The female piece of wood in the\nfire-boring ritual was obtained[539] from the wood of a parasitical or\ncreeping plant, the fire mother. The “mare” rests upon “Marentak,” in\nwhich Grimm suspects the mistletoe. The mistletoe was a remedy against\nbarrenness. In Gaul the Druid alone was allowed to climb the holy oak\namid solemn ceremonies after the completed sacrifice, in order to cut\noff the ritual mistletoe.[540] This act is a religiously limited and\norganized incest. That which grows on the tree is the child,[541] which\nman might have by the mother; then man himself would be in a renewed and\nrejuvenated form; and precisely this is what man cannot have, because\nthe incest prohibition forbids it. As the Celtic custom shows, the act\nis performed by the priest only, with the observation of certain\nceremonies; the hero god and the redeemer of the world, however, do the\nunpermitted, the superhuman thing, and through it purchase immortality.\nThe dragon, who must be overcome for this purpose, means, as must have\nbeen for some time clearly seen, the resistance against the incest.\nDragon and serpent, especially with the characteristic accumulation of\nanxiety attributes, are the symbolic representations of anxiety which\ncorrespond to the repressed incest wish. It is, therefore, intelligible,\nwhen we come across the tree with the snake again and again (in Paradise\nthe snake even tempts to sin). The snake or dragon possesses in\nparticular the meaning of treasure guardian and defender. The phallic,\nas well as the feminine, meaning of the dragon[542] indicates that it is\nagain a symbol of the sexual neutral (or bisexual) libido, that is to\nsay, a symbol of the _libido in opposition_. In this significance the\nblack horse, Apaosha, the demon of opposition, appears in the old\nPersian song, Tishtriya, where it obstructs the sources of the rain\nlake. The white horse Tishtriya makes two futile attempts to vanquish\nApaosha; at the third attempt, with the help of Ahuramazda, he is\nsuccessful.[543] Whereupon the sluices of heaven open and a fruitful\nrain pours down upon the earth.[544] In this song one sees very\nbeautifully in the choice of symbol how libido is opposed to libido,\nwill against will, the discordance of primitive man with himself, which\nhe recognizes again in all the adversity and contrasts of external\nnature.\n\nThe symbol of the tree encoiled by the serpent may also be translated as\nthe mother defended from incest by resistance. This symbol is by no\nmeans rare upon Mithraic monuments. The rock encircled by a snake is to\nbe comprehended similarly, because Mithra is one born from a rock. The\nmenace of the new-born by the snake (Mithra, Hercules) is made clear\nthrough the legend of Lilith and Lamia. Python, the dragon of Leto, and\nPoine, who devastates the land of Crotopus, are sent by the father of\nthe new-born. This idea indicates the localization, well known in\npsychoanalysis, of the incest anxiety in the father. The father\nrepresents the active repulse of the incest wish of the son. The crime,\nunconsciously wished for by the son, is imputed to the father under the\nguise of a pretended murderous purpose, this being the cause of the\nmortal fear of the son for the father, a frequent neurotic symptom. In\nconformity with this idea, the monster to be overcome by the young hero\nis frequently a giant, the guardian of the treasure or the woman. A\nstriking example is the giant Chumbaba in the Gilgamesh epic, who\nprotected the garden of Ishtar;[545] he is overcome by Gilgamesh,\nwhereby Ishtar is won. Thereupon she makes erotic advances towards\nGilgamesh.[546] This data should be sufficient to render intelligible\nthe rôle of Horus in Plutarch, especially the violent usage of Isis.\nThrough overpowering the mother the hero becomes equal to the sun; he\nreproduces himself. He wins the strength of the invincible sun, the\npower of eternal rejuvenation. We thus understand a series of\nrepresentations from the Mithraic myth on the Heddernheim relief. There\nwe see, first of all, the birth of Mithra from the top of the tree; the\nnext representation shows him carrying the conquered bull (comparable to\nthe monstrous bull overcome by Gilgamesh). This bull signifies the\nconcentrated significance of the monster, the father, who as giant and\ndangerous animal embodies the incest prohibition, and agrees with the\nindividual libido of the sun-hero, which he overcomes by self-sacrifice.\nThe third picture represents Mithra, when he grasps the head ornament of\nthe sun, the nimbus. This act recalls to us, first of all, the violence\nof Horus towards Isis; secondly, the Christian basic thought, _that\nthose who have overcome attain the crown of eternal life_. On the fourth\npicture Sol kneels before Mithra. These last two representations show\nplainly that Mithra has taken to himself the strength of the sun, so\nthat he becomes the lord of the sun as well. He has conquered “his\nanimal nature,” the bull. The animal knows no incest prohibition; man\nis, therefore, man because he conquers the incest wish, that is, the\nanimal nature. Thus Mithra has sacrificed his animal nature, the incest\nwish, and with that has overcome the mother, that is to say, “the\nterrible death-bringing mother.” A solution is already anticipated in\nthe Gilgamesh epic through the formal renunciation of the horrible\nIshtar by the hero. The overcoming of the mother in the Mithraic\nsacrifice, which had almost an ascetic character, took place no longer\nby the archaic overpowering, but through the renunciation, the sacrifice\nof the wish. The primitive thought of incestuous reproduction through\nentrance into the mother’s womb had already been displaced, because man\nwas so far advanced in domestication that he believed that the eternal\nlife of the sun is reached, not through the perpetration of incest, but\nthrough the sacrifice of the incest wish. This important change\nexpressed in the Mithraic mystery finds its full expression for the\nfirst time in the symbol of the crucified God. A bleeding human\nsacrifice was hung on the tree of life for Adam’s sins.[547] The\nfirst-born sacrifices its life to the mother when he suffers, hanging on\nthe branch, a disgraceful and painful death, a mode of death which\nbelongs to the most ignominious forms of execution, which Roman\nantiquity had reserved for only the lowest criminal. Thus the hero dies,\nas if he had committed the most shameful crime; he does this by\nreturning into the birth-giving branch of the tree of life, at the same\ntime paying for his guilt with the pangs of death. The animal nature is\nrepressed most powerfully in this deed of the highest courage and the\ngreatest renunciation; therefore, a greater salvation is to be expected\nfor humanity, because such a deed alone seems appropriate to expiate\nAdam’s guilt.\n\n[Illustration: BULL-SACRIFICE OF MITHRA]\n\nAs has already been mentioned, the hanging of the sacrifice on the tree\nis a generally widespread ritual custom, Germanic examples being\nespecially abundant. The ritual consists in the sacrifice being pierced\nby a spear.[548] Thus it is said of Odin (Edda, Havamal):\n\n               “I know that I hung on the windswept tree\n               Nine nights through,\n               Wounded by a spear, dedicated to Odin\n               I myself to myself.”\n\nThe hanging of the sacrifice to the cross also occurred in America prior\nto its discovery. Müller[549] mentions the Fejervaryian manuscript (a\nMexican hieroglyphic kodex), at the conclusion of which there is a\ncolossal cross, in the middle of which there hangs a bleeding divinity.\nEqually interesting is the cross of Palenque;[550] up above is a bird,\non either side two human figures, who look at the cross and hold a child\nagainst it either for sacrifice or baptism. The old Mexicans are said to\nhave invoked the favor of Centeotls, “the daughter of heaven and the\ngoddess of wheat,” every spring by nailing upon the cross a youth or a\nmaiden and by shooting the sacrifice with arrows.[551] The name of the\nMexican cross signifies “tree of our life or flesh.”[552]\n\nAn effigy from the Island of Philae represents Osiris in the form of a\ncrucified god, wept over by Isis and Nephthys, the sister consort.[553]\n\nThe meaning of the cross is certainly not limited to the tree of life,\nas has already been shown. Just as the tree of life has also a phallic\nsub-meaning (as libido symbol), so there is a further significance to\nthe cross than life and immortality.[554] Müller uses it as a sign of\nrain and of fertility, because it appears among the Indians distinctly\nas a magic charm of fertility. It goes without saying, therefore, that\nit plays a rôle in the sun cult. It is also noteworthy that the sign of\nthe cross is an important sign for the keeping away of all evil, like\nthe ancient gesture of Manofica. The phallic amulets also serve the same\npurpose. Zöckler appears to have overlooked the fact that the phallic\nCrux Ansata is the same cross which has flourished in countless examples\nin the soil of antiquity. Copies of this Crux Ansata are found in many\nplaces, and almost every collection of antiquities possesses one or more\nspecimens.[555]\n\nFinally, it must be mentioned that the form of the human body is\nimitated in the cross as of a man with arms outspread. It is remarkable\nthat in early Christian representations Christ is not nailed to the\ncross, but stands before it with arms outstretched.[556] Maurice[557]\ngives a striking basis for this interpretation when he says:\n\n  “It is a fact not less remarkable than well attested, that the Druids\n  in their groves were accustomed to select the most stately and\n  beautiful tree as an emblem of the deity they adored, and cutting off\n  the side branches, they affixed two of the largest of them to the\n  highest part of the trunk, in such a manner that those branches\n  extended on each side like the arms of a man, and together with the\n  body presented the appearance of a huge cross; and in the bark in\n  several places was also inscribed the letter Τ (tau).”[558]\n\n“The tree of knowledge” of the Hindoo Dschaina sect assumes human form;\nit was represented as a mighty, thick trunk in the form of a human head,\nfrom the top of which grew out two longer branches hanging down at the\nsides and one short, vertical, uprising branch crowned by a bud or\nblossom-like thickening.[559] Robertson in his “Evangelical Myths”\nmentions that in the Assyrian system there exists the representation of\nthe divinity in the form of a cross, in which the vertical beam\ncorresponds to a human form and the horizontal beam to a pair of\nconventionalized wings. Old Grecian idols such, for example, as were\nfound in large numbers in Aegina have a similar character, an\nimmoderately long head and arms slightly raised, wing-shaped, and in\nfront distinct breasts.[560]\n\nI must leave it an open question as to whether the symbol of the cross\nhas any relation to the two pieces of wood in the religious fire\nproduction, as is frequently claimed. It does appear, however, as if the\ncross symbol actually still possessed the significance of “union,” for\nthis idea belongs to the fertility charm, and especially to the thought\nof eternal rebirth, which is most intimately bound up with the cross.\nThe thought of “union,” expressed by the symbol of the cross, is met\nwith in “Timaios” of Plato, where the world soul is conceived as\nstretched out between heaven and earth in the form of an X (Chi); hence\nin the form of a “St. Andrew’s cross.” When we now learn, furthermore,\nthat the world soul contains in itself _the world as a body_, then this\npicture inevitably reminds us of the mother.\n\n  (_Dialogues of Plato._ Jowett, Vol. II, page 528.)",
