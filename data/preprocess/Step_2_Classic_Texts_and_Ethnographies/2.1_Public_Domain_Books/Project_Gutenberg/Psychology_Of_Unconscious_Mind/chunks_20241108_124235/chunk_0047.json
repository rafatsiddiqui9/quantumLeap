Having these purposes in view he\n  created the world to be a blessed god.”\n\nThis highest degree of inactivity and freedom from desire, symbolized\nby the _being enclosed within itself_, signifies divine blessedness.\nThe only human prototype of this conception is the child in the\nmother’s womb, or rather more, the adult man in the continuous embrace\nof the mother, from whom he originates. Corresponding to this\nmythologic-philosophic conception, the enviable Diogenes inhabited a\ntub, thus giving mythologic expression to the blessedness and\nresemblance to the Divine in his freedom from desire. Plato says as\nfollows of the bond of the world soul to the world body:\n\n  “Now God did not make the soul after the body, although we have spoken\n  of them in this order; for when he put them together he would never\n  have allowed that the elder should serve the younger, but this is what\n  we say at random, because we ourselves too are very largely affected\n  by chance. Whereas he made the soul in origin and excellence prior to\n  and older than the body, to be the ruler and mistress, of whom the\n  body was to be the subject.”\n\nIt seems conceivable from other indications that the conception of the\nsoul in general is a derivative of the mother-imago, that is to say, a\nsymbolic designation for the amount of libido remaining in the\nmother-imago. (Compare the Christian representation of the soul as the\nbride of Christ.) The further development of the world soul in “Timaios”\ntakes place in an obscure fashion in mystic numerals. When the mixture\nwas completed the following occurred:\n\n  “This entire compound he divided lengthways into two parts, which he\n  joined to one another at the center like the figure of an X.”\n\nThis passage approaches very closely the division and union of Atman,\nwho, after the division, is compared to a man and a woman who hold each\nother in an embrace. Another passage is worth mentioning:\n\n  “After the entire union of the soul had taken place, according to the\n  master’s mind, he formed all that is corporeal within this, and joined\n  it together so as to penetrate it throughout.”\n\nMoreover, I refer to my remarks about the maternal meaning of the world\nsoul in Plotinus, in Chapter II.\n\nA similar detachment of the symbol of the cross from a concrete figure\nwe find among the Muskhogean Indians, who stretch above the surface of\nthe water (pond or stream) two ropes crosswise and at the point of\nintersection throw into the water fruits, oil and precious stones as a\nsacrifice.[561] Here the divinity is evidently the water, not the cross,\nwhich designates the place of sacrifice only, through the point of\nintersection. The sacrifice at the place of union indicates why this\nsymbol was a primitive charm of fertility,[562] why we meet it so\nfrequently in the prechristian era among the goddesses of love (mother\ngoddesses), especially among the Egyptians in Isis and the sun-god. We\nhave already discussed the continuous union of these two divinities. As\nthe cross (Tau [Τ], Crux Ansata) always recurs in the hand of Tum, the\nsupreme God, the hegemon of the Ennead, it may not be superfluous to say\nsomething more of the destination of Tum. The Tum of On-Heliopolis bears\nthe name “the father of his mother”; what that means needs no\nexplanation; Jusas or Nebit-Hotpet, the goddess joined to him, _was\ncalled sometimes the mother, sometimes the daughter, sometimes the wife\nof the god_. The day of the beginning of autumn is designated in the\nHeliopolitan inscriptions as the “festival of the goddess Jusasit,” as\n“the arrival of the sister for the purpose of uniting with her father.”\nIt is the day in which “the goddess Mehnit completes her work, so that\nthe god Osiris may enter into the left eye.” (By which the moon is\nmeant.[563]) The day is also called the filling up of the sacred eye\nwith its needs. The heavenly cow with the moon eye, the cow-headed Isis,\ntakes to herself in the autumn equinox the seed which procreates Horus.\n(Moon as keeper of the seed.) The “eye” evidently represents the\ngenitals, as in the myth of Indra, who had to bear spread over his whole\nbody the likeness of Yoni (vulva), on account of a Bathsheba outrage,\nbut was so far pardoned by the gods that the disgraceful likeness of\nYoni was changed into eyes.[564] The “pupil” in the eye is a child. The\ngreat god becomes a child again; he enters the mother’s womb in order to\nrenew himself.[565] In a hymn it is said:\n\n  “Thy mother, the heavens, stretches forth her arms to thee.”\n\nIn another place it is said:\n\n  “Thou shinest, oh father of the gods, upon the back of thy mother,\n  daily thy mother takes thee in her arms. When thou illuminatest the\n  dwelling of night, thou unitest with thy mother, the heavens.”[566]\n\nThe Tum of Pitum-Heliopolis not only bears the Crux Ansata as a symbol,\nbut also has this sign as his most frequent surname, that is, ānχ or\nānχi, which means “life” or “the living.” He is chiefly honored as the\ndemon serpent, Agatho, of whom it is said, “The holy demon serpent\nAgatho goes forth from the city Nezi.” The snake, on account of casting\nits skin, is the symbol of renewal, as is the scarabæus, a symbol of the\nsun, of whom it is said that he, being of masculine sex only, reproduces\nhimself.\n\nThe name Chnum (another name for Tum, always meaning “the sun-god”)\ncomes from the verb χnum, which means “to bind together, to unite.”[567]\nChnum appears chiefly as the potter, the moulder of his egg. The cross\nseems, therefore, to be an extraordinarily condensed symbol; its supreme\nmeaning is that of the tree of life, and, therefore, is a symbol of the\nmother. The symbolization in a human form is, therefore, intelligible.\nThe phallic forms of the Crux Ansata belong to the abstract meaning of\n“life” and “fertility,” as well as to the meaning of “union,” which we\ncan now very properly interpret as _cohabitation with the mother for the\npurpose of renewal_.[568] It is, therefore, not only a very touching but\nalso a very significant naïve symbolism when Mary, in an Old English\nlament of the Virgin,[569] accuses the cross of being a false tree,\nwhich unjustly and without reason destroyed “the pure fruit of her body,\nher gentle birdling,” with a poisonous draught, the draught of death,\nwhich is destined only for the guilty descendants of the sinner Adam.\nHer son was not a sharer in that guilt. (Compare with this the cunning\nof Isis with the fatal draught of love.) Mary laments:\n\n  “Cross, thou art the evil stepmother of my son, so high hast thou hung\n  him that I cannot even kiss his feet! Cross, thou art my mortal enemy,\n  thou hast slain my little blue bird!”\n\nThe holy cross answers:\n\n  “Woman, I thank thee for my honor: thy splendid fruit, which now I\n  bear, shines as a red blossom.[570] Not alone to save thee but to save\n  the whole world this precious flower blooms in thee.”[571]\n\nSanta Crux says of the relation to each other of the two mothers (Isis\nin the morning and Isis in the evening):\n\n  “Thou hast been crowned as Queen of Heaven on account of the child,\n  which thou hast borne. But I shall appear as the shining relic to the\n  whole world, at the day of judgment. I shall then raise my lament for\n  thy divine son innocently slain upon me.”\n\nThus the murderous mother of death unites with the mother of life in\nbringing forth a child. In their lament for the dying God, and as\noutward token of their union, Mary kisses the cross, and is reconciled\nto it.[572] The naïve Egyptian antiquity has preserved for us the union\nof the contrasting tendencies in the mother idea of Isis. Naturally this\nimago is merely a symbol of the libido of the son for the mother, and\ndescribes the conflict between love and incest resistance. The criminal\nincestuous purpose of the son appears projected as criminal cunning in\nthe mother-imago. The separation of the son from the mother signifies\nthe separation of man from the generic consciousness of animals, from\nthat infantile archaic thought characterized by the absence of\nindividual consciousness.\n\nIt was only the power of the incest prohibition which created the\nself-conscious individual, who formerly had been thoughtlessly one with\nthe tribe, and in this way alone did the idea of individual and final\ndeath become possible. Thus through the sin of Adam death came into the\nworld. This, as is evident, is expressed figuratively, that is, in\ncontrast form. The mother’s defence against the incest appears to the\nson as a malicious act, which delivers him over to the fear of death.\nThis conflict faces us in the Gilgamesh epic in its original freshness\nand passion, where also the incest wish is projected onto the mother.\n\nThe neurotic who cannot leave the mother has good reasons; the fear of\ndeath holds him there. It seems as if no idea and no word were strong\nenough to express the meaning of this. Entire religions were constructed\nin order to give words to the immensity of this conflict. This struggle\nfor expression which continued down through the centuries certainly\ncannot have its source in the restricted realm of the vulgar conception\nof incest. Rather one must understand the law which is ultimately\nexpressed as “Incest prohibition” as coercion to domestication, and\nconsider the religious systems as institutions which first receive, then\norganize and gradually sublimate, the motor forces of the animal nature\nnot immediately available for cultural purposes.\n\nWe will now return to the visions of Miss Miller. Those now following\nneed no further detailed discussion. The next vision is the image of a\n“purple bay.” The symbolism of the sea connects smoothly with that which\nprecedes. One might think here in addition of the reminiscences of the\nBay of Naples, which we came across in Part I. In the sequence of the\nwhole, however, we must not overlook the significance of the “bay.” In\nFrench it is called _une baie_, which probably corresponds to a bay in\nthe English text. It might be worth while here to glance at the\netymological side of this idea. Bay is generally used for something\nwhich is open, just as the Catalonian word _badia_ (_bai_) comes from\n_badar_, “to open.” In French _bayer_ means “to have the mouth open, to\ngape.” Another word for the same is _Meerbusen_, “bay or gulf”; Latin\n_sinus_, and a third word is golf (gulf), which in French stands in\nclosest relation to _gouffre_ = abyss. Golf is derived from\n“κόλπος,”[573] which also means “bosom” and “womb,” “mother-womb,” also\n“vagina.” It can also mean a fold of a dress or pocket; it may also mean\na deep valley between high mountains. These expressions clearly show\nwhat primitive ideas lie at their base. They render intelligible\nGoethe’s choice of words at that place where Faust wishes to follow the\nsun with winged desire in order in the everlasting day “to drink its\neternal light”:\n\n             “The mountain chain with all its gorges deep,\n             Would then no more impede my godlike motion;\n             And now before mine eyes expands the ocean,\n             With all its bays, in shining sleep!”\n\nFaust’s desire, like that of every hero, inclines towards the mysteries\nof rebirth, of immortality; therefore, his course leads to the sea, and\ndown into the monstrous jaws of death, the horror and narrowness of\nwhich at the same time signify the new day.\n\n      “Out on the open ocean speeds my dreaming:\n      The glassy flood before my feet is gleaming,\n      A new day beckons to a newer shore!\n      A fiery chariot borne on buoyant pinions,\n      Sweeps near me now! I soon shall ready be\n      To pierce the ether’s high, unknown dominions,\n      To reach new spheres of pure activity!\n      This Godlike rapture, this supreme existence....\n\n             ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n      “Yes, let me dare those gates to fling asunder,\n      Which every man would fain go slinking by!\n      ’Tis time, through deeds this word of truth to thunder;\n      That with the height of God’s Man’s dignity may vie!\n      Nor from that gloomy gulf to shrink affrighted,\n      Where fancy doth herself to self-born pangs compel,—\n      To struggle toward that pass benighted,\n      Around whose narrow mouth flame all the fires of Hell:—\n      To take this step with cheerful resolution,\n      Though Nothingness should be the certain swift conclusion!”",
