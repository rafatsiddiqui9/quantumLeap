    "paragraph": "After the discussions in the preceding chapter, there is need only of a hint that the symbol of the forest coincides essentially with the meaning of the holy tree. The holy tree is found generally in a sacred forest enclosure or in the garden of Paradise. The sacred grove often takes the place of the taboo tree and assumes all the attributes of the latter. The erotic symbolism of the garden is generally known. The forest, like the tree, has mythologically a maternal significance. In the vision which now follows, the forest furnishes the stage upon which the dramatic representation of the end of Chiwantopel is played. This act, therefore, takes place in or near the mother.First, I will give the beginning of the drama as it is in the original text, up to the first attempt at sacrifice. At the beginning of the next chapter the reader will find the continuation, the monologue and the sacrificial scene. The drama begins as follows:\u201cThe personage Chiwantopel, came from the south, on horseback; around  him a cloak of vivid colors, red, blue and white. An Indian in a  costume of doe skin, covered with beads and ornamented with feathers  advances, squats down and prepares to let fly an arrow at Chiwantopel.  The latter presents his breast in an attitude of defiance, and the  Indian, fascinated by that sight, slinks away and disappears within  the forest.\u201d\u1f10\u03bb\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f25\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5 \u1f0c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u1f78\u03bd \u1f01\u03b3\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u1f7a\u03bd \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u1f78\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b2\u03bf\u03ad\u1ff3  \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u1f76 \u03b8\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f04\u03be\u03b9\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03b5, \u1f04\u03be\u03b9\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03b5.[583][584]",

    "question": "How does the forest symbolize a maternal significance in the text?",
    "answer": "The forest, like the tree, has mythologically a maternal significance. This suggests that the forest in the drama represents a nurturing or protective maternal figure, similar to how a tree might be seen as a symbol of life and growth.",
