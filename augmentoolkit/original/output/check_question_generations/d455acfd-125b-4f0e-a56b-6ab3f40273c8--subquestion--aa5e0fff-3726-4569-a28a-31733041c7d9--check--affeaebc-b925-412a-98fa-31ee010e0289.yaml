    \ Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not\
    \ the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided. \n\nFollowing this,\

    \ includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY,\

    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ origin this process was especially necessary; for that period, as the result\
    \ of the incredible contrast between slavery and the freedom of the citizens and\
    \ masters, had entirely lost the consciousness of the common bond of mankind.\
    \ One of the next and most essential reasons for the energetic regression to the\
    \ infantile in Christianity, which goes hand in hand with the revival of the incest\
    \ problem, was probably to be found in the far-reaching depreciation of women.\
    \ At that time sexuality was so easily attainable that the result could only be\
    \ a very excessive depreciation of the sexual object. The existence of personal\
    \ values was first discovered by Christianity, and there are many people who have\
    \ not discovered it even in the present day. However, the depreciation of the\
    \ sexual object hinders the outflow of that libido which cannot be satisfied by\
    \ sexual activity, because it belongs to an already desexualized higher order.\
    \ (If it were not so, a Don Juan could never be neurotic; but the contrary is\
    \ the case.) For how might those higher valuations be given to a worthless, despised\
    \ object? Therefore, the libido, after having seen a “Helen in every woman” for\
    \ so long a time, sets out on a search for the difficult to obtain, the worshipped,\
    \ but perhaps unattainable, goal, and which in the unconscious is the mother.\
    \ Therefore the symbolic needs, based on the incest resistance, arise again in\
    \ an increased degree, which promptly transforms the beautiful, sinful world of\
    \ the Olympian Gods into incomprehensible, dreamlike, dark mysteries, which, with\
    \ their accessions of symbols and obscure meaningful texts, remove us very far\
    \ from the religious feelings of that Roman-Græco world. When we see how much\
