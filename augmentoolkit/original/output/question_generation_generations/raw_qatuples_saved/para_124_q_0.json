    "paragraph": "transference, namely, through a regressive revival of the parent imago. In the transference neurosis (hysterical), where merely a part of the _immediate sexual_ libido is taken away from reality by the specific sexual repression, the substituted product is a phantasy of individual origin and significance, with only a trace of those archaic traits found in the phantasies of those mental disorders in which a portion of the general human function of reality organized since antiquity has broken off. This portion can be replaced only by a generally valid archaic surrogate. We owe a simple and clear example of this proposition to the investigation of Honegger.[271] A paranoic of good intelligence who has a clear idea of the spherical form of the earth and its rotation around the sun replaces the modern astronomical views by a system worked out in great detail, which one must call archaic, in which the earth is a flat disc over which the sun travels.[272] (I am reminded of the sun-phallus mentioned in the first part of this book, for which we are also indebted to Honegger.) Spielrein has likewise furnished some very interesting examples of archaic definitions which begin in certain illnesses to overlay the real meanings of the modern word. For example, Spielrein\u2019s patient had correctly discovered the mythological significance of alcohol, the intoxicating drink, to be \u201can effusion of seed.\u201d[273] She also had a symbolism of boiling which I must place parallel to the especially important alchemistic vision of Zosimos,[274] who found people in boiling water within the cavity of the altar.[275] This patient used earth in place of mother, and also water to express mother.[276] I refrain from further examples because future work of the Zurich School will furnish abundant evidence of this sort.",

    "question": "What concept is being discussed in the text, and what does it involve?",
    "answer": "The concept discussed is transference, specifically through a regressive revival of the parent imago. This involves the patient projecting a part of the immediate sexual libido onto a substitute product, which is a phantasy of individual origin and significance, often retaining only a trace of archaic traits.",
