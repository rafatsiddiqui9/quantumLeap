    In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude
    easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that
    are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners.
    These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much
    to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these
    interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers.
    The vastness of these mysteries spans from the minuscule quantum realm to the

    \ made of brass, the other of ass’ dung. Hecate has snakelike feet, which, as\
    \ in the triple form ascribed to Hecate, points to her phallic libido nature.[721]\
    \ In Tralles, Hecate appears next to Priapus; there is also a Hecate Aphrodisias.\
    \ Her symbols are the key,[722] the whip,[723] the snake,[724] the dagger[725]\
    \ and the torch.[726] As mother of death, dogs accompany her, the significance\
    \ of which we have previously discussed at length. As guardian of the door of\
    \ Hades and as Goddess of dogs, she is of threefold form, and really identified\
    \ with Cerberus. Thus Hercules, in bringing up Cerberus, brings the conquered\
    \ mother of death into the upper world. As spirit mother (moon!), she sends madness,\
    \ lunacy. (This mythical observation states that “the mother” sends madness; by\
    \ far the majority of the cases of insanity consist, in fact, in the domination\
    \ of the individual by the material of the incest phantasy.) In the mysteries\
    \ of Cerberus, a rod, called λευκόφυλλος,[727] was broken off. This rod protected\
    \ the purity of virgins, and caused any one who touched the plant to become insane.\
    \ We recognize in this the motive of the sacred tree, which, as mother, must not\
    \ be touched, an act which only an insane person would commit. Hecate, as nightmare,\
    \ appears in the form of Empusa, in a vampire rôle, or as Lamia, as devourer of\
    \ men; perhaps, also, in that more beautiful guise, “The Bride of Corinth.” She\
    \ is the mother of all charms and witches, the patron of Medea, because the power\
    \ of the “terrible mother” is magical and irresistible (working upward from the\
    \ unconscious). In Greek syncretism, she plays a very significant rôle. She is\
    \ confused with Artemis, who also has the surname ἑκάτη,[728] “the one striking\
