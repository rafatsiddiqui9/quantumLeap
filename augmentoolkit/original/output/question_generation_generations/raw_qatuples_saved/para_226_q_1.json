    "paragraph": "The name Chnum (another name for Tum, always meaning \u201cthe sun-god\u201d) comes from the verb \u03c7num, which means \u201cto bind together, to unite.\u201d[567] Chnum appears chiefly as the potter, the moulder of his egg. The cross seems, therefore, to be an extraordinarily condensed symbol; its supreme meaning is that of the tree of life, and, therefore, is a symbol of the mother. The symbolization in a human form is, therefore, intelligible. The phallic forms of the Crux Ansata belong to the abstract meaning of \u201clife\u201d and \u201cfertility,\u201d as well as to the meaning of \u201cunion,\u201d which we can now very properly interpret as _cohabitation with the mother for the purpose of renewal_.[568] It is, therefore, not only a very touching but also a very significant na\u00efve symbolism when Mary, in an Old English lament of the Virgin,[569] accuses the cross of being a false tree, which unjustly and without reason destroyed \u201cthe pure fruit of her body, her gentle birdling,\u201d with a poisonous draught, the draught of death, which is destined only for the guilty descendants of the sinner Adam. Her son was not a sharer in that guilt. (Compare with this the cunning of Isis with the fatal draught of love.) Mary laments:\u201cCross, thou art the evil stepmother of my son, so high hast thou hung  him that I cannot even kiss his feet! Cross, thou art my mortal enemy,  thou hast slain my little blue bird!\u201dThe holy cross answers:\u201cWoman, I thank thee for my honor: thy splendid fruit, which now I  bear, shines as a red blossom.[570] Not alone to save thee but to save  the whole world this precious flower blooms in thee.\u201d[571]Santa Crux says of the relation to each other of the two mothers (Isis in the morning and Isis in the evening):",

    "question": "How does the cross serve as a condensed symbol, and what are its primary meanings?",
    "answer": "The cross serves as a condensed symbol representing the tree of life, which symbolizes the mother. Therefore, the cross can be interpreted as a symbol of fertility, renewal, and union, often representing cohabitation with the mother for the purpose of renewal.",
