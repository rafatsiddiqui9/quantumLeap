    "paragraph": "We know that from the primitive sounds human speech has developed. Corresponding to the psychological situation, it might be assumed that language owes its real origin to this moment, when the impulse, repressed into the presexual stage, turns to the external in order to find an equivalent object there. The real thought as a conscious activity is, as we saw in the first part of this book, a thinking with positive determination towards the external world, that is to say, a \u201cspeech thinking.\u201d This sort of thinking seems to have originated at that moment. It is very remarkable that this view, which was won by the path of reasoning, is again supported by old tradition and other mythological fragments.In Aitareyopanishad[320] the following quotation is to be found in the doctrine of the development of man: \u201cBeing brooded-o\u2019er, his mouth hatched out, like as an egg; from out his mouth (came) speech, from speech, the fire.\u201d In Part II, where it is depicted how the newly created objects entered man, it reads: \u201cFire, speech becoming, entered in the mouth.\u201d These quotations allow us to plainly recognize the intimate connection between fire and speech.[321] In Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad is to be found this passage:\u201c\u2018Yay\u00f1avalkya,\u2019 thus he spake, \u2018when after the death of this man his  speech entereth the fire, his breath into the wind, his eye into the  sun, etc.\u2019\u201dA further quotation from the Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad reads:",

    "question": "What further support does the Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad provide for the relationship between speech and fire?",
    "answer": "The Brihad\u00e2ranyaka-Upanishad provides support for the relationship between speech and fire by mentioning that after a man's death, his speech enters the fire. This passage underscores the connection between speech and fire, suggesting that speech and fire are linked in both life and death, according to the text.",
