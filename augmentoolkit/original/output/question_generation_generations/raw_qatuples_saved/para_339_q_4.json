    "paragraph": "humanity and the centuries-old past in all people, namely, the common property left behind from all development which is given to all men, like the sunshine and the air. But in loving this inheritance they love that which is common to all. Thus they turn back to the mother of humanity, that is to say, to the spirit of the race, and regain in this way something of that connection and of that mysterious and irresistible power which is imparted by the feeling of belonging to the herd. It is the problem of Ant\u00e6us, who preserves his gigantic strength only through contact with mother earth. This temporary withdrawal into one\u2019s self, which, as we have already seen, signifies a regression to the childish bond to the parent, seems to act favorably, within certain limits, in its effect upon the psychologic condition of the individual. It is in general to be expected that the two fundamental mechanisms of the psychoses, transference and introversion, are to a wide extent extremely appropriate methods of normal reaction against complexes; transference as a means of escaping from the complex into reality; introversion as a means of detaching one\u2019s self from reality through the complex.",

    "question": "How are transference and introversion described as beneficial mechanisms in the psychological condition of an individual?",
    "answer": "Transference and introversion are described as beneficial mechanisms because they act as normal reactions against complexes. Transference helps an individual escape from the complex into reality, while introversion allows an individual to detach from reality through the influence of a complex, both within certain limits.",
