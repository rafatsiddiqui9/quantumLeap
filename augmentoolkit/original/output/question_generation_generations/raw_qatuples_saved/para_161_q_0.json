    "paragraph": "The very evident onanistic boring of the patient can be traced back to a very early stage of childhood, which is prior to the period of local onanism. That time is still psychologically very obscure, because individual reproductions and memories are lacking to a great extent, the same as among animals. The race characteristics (manner of life) predominate during the entire life of the animal, whereas among men the individual character asserts itself over the race type. Granting the correctness of this remark, we are struck with the apparently wholly incomprehensible individual activity of this child at this early age. We learn from her later life history that her development, which is, as is always the case, intimately interwoven with parallel external events, has led to that mental disturbance which is especially well known on account of its individuality and the originality of its productions, i. e. dementia pr\u00e6cox. The peculiarity of this disturbance, as we have pointed out above, depends upon the predominance of the phantastic form of thought\u2014of the infantile in general. From this type of thinking proceed all those numerous contacts with mythological products, and that which we consider as original and wholly individual creations are very often creations which are comparable with nothing but those of antiquity. I believe that this comparison can be applied to all formations of this remarkable illness, and perhaps also to this special symptom of boring. We have already seen that the onanistic boring of the patient dated from a very early stage of childhood, that is to say, it was reproduced from that period of the past. The sick woman fell back for the first time into the early onanism only after she had been married many years, and following the death of her child, with whom she had identified herself through an overindulgent love. When the child died the still healthy mother was overcome by early infantile symptoms ",

    "question": "What stage of childhood is being referred to when discussing the onset of onanistic behaviors, and why is this stage psychologically obscure?",
    "answer": "The stage of childhood being referred to is prior to the period of local onanism. This stage is psychologically obscure because individual reproductions and memories are lacking, similar to what is observed among animals. The race characteristics (manner of life) predominate during the entire life of the animal, whereas among humans, the individual character asserts itself over the race type.",
