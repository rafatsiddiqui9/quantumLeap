    "paragraph": "The Lamias are typical nightmares, the feminine nature of which is abundantly proven.[514] Their universal peculiarity is that they ride upon their victims. Their counterparts are the spectral horses which bear their riders along in a mad gallop. One recognizes very easily in these symbolic forms the type of anxious dream which, as Riklin shows,[515] has already become important for the interpretation of fairy tales through the investigation of Laistner.[516] The typical riding takes on a special aspect through the results of the analytic investigation of infantile psychology; the two contributions of Freud and myself[517] have emphasized, on one side, the anxiety significance of the horse, on the other side the sexual meaning of the phantasy of riding. When we take these experiences into consideration, we need no longer be surprised that the maternal \u201cworld-ash\u201d Ygdrasil is called in German \u201cthe frightful horse.\u201d Cannegieter[518] says of nightmares:\u201cAbigunt eas nymphas (matres deas, mairas) hodie rustici osse capitis  equini tectis injecto, cujusmodi ossa per has terras in rusticorum  villis crebra est animadvertere. Nocte autem ad concubia equitare  creduntur et equos fatigare ad longinqua itinera.\u201d[519]",

    "question": "What evidence from historical texts does the passage provide about the belief in nightmares?",
    "answer": "The passage cites Cannegieter's description of nightmares, which states that rustics believe nightmares take the form of nymphs (maternal deities, Mairas) who are seen riding on horses with heads made of horse bones. These creatures are also believed to ride to concubinage and to fatigue horses on long journeys. This evidence shows that there was a widespread belief in the physical manifestations of nightmares as riding creatures, particularly horses.",
