    "paragraph": "Miss Miller neglects to tell which passages in Job occurred to her mind. These, unfortunately, are therefore only general suppositions. Take first, the analogy to the Lost Paradise. Job lost all that he had, and this was due to an act of Satan, who wished to incite him against God. In the same way mankind, through the temptation of the serpent, lost Paradise, and was plunged into earth\u2019s torments. The idea, or rather the mood which is expressed by the reference to the Lost Paradise, is Miss Miller\u2019s feeling that she had lost something which was connected with satanic temptation. To her it happened, just as to Job, that she suffered innocently, for she did not fall a victim to temptation. Job\u2019s sufferings are not understood by his friends;[69] no one knows that Satan has taken a hand in the game, and that Job is truly innocent. Job never tires of avowing his innocence. Is there a hint in that? We know that certain neurotic and especially mentally diseased people continually defend their innocence against non-existent attacks; however, one discovers at a closer examination that the patient, while he apparently defends his innocence without reason, fulfils with that a \u201cDeckhandlung,\u201d the energy for which arises from just those impulses, whose sinful character is revealed by the contents of the pretended reproach and calumny.[70]Job suffered doubly, on one side through the loss of his fortune, on the other through the lack of understanding in his friends; the latter can be seen throughout the book. The suffering of the misunderstood recalls the figure of Cyrano de Bergerac\u2014he too suffered doubly, on one side through hopeless love, on the other side through misunderstanding. He falls, as we have seen, in the last hopeless battle against \u201cLe Mensonge, les Compromis, les Pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, les L\u00e2chet\u00e9s et la Sottise.\u2014Oui, Vous m\u2019arrachez tout le laurier et la rose!\u201dJob laments",

    "question": "How do the friends of Job fail to understand his suffering, and what can this be compared to in terms of modern psychological conditions?\n\n**ANS:** \nThe friends of Job fail to understand his suffering because they do not know that Satan has played a role in his trials, and thus assume he is not truly innocent. This can be compared to certain neurotic or mentally diseased individuals who continually defend their innocence against non-existent attacks. However, a closer examination reveals that their defense is a \"Deckhandlung,\" or a defense motivated by the very impulses whose sinful nature is revealed by the contents of the supposed reproach and calumny.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat are Job's suffering and the theme of misunderstanding compared to in the text, and what figure from literature does this evoke?",
    "answer": "Job's suffering and the theme of misunderstanding are compared to the figure of Cyrano de Bergerac from the play \"Cyrano de Bergerac.\" Both Job and Cyrano suffer doubly, with Job losing his fortune and being misunderstood by his friends, and Cyrano suffering from hopeless love and misunderstanding. Cyrano ultimately falls in his last battle against societal ills like \"Le Mensonge, les Compromis, les Pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, les L\u00e2chet\u00e9s et la Sottise.\" Job laments, \"Oui, Vous m'arrachez tout le laurier et la rose!\" which reflects his deep emotional pain and loss.",
