    "paragraph": "The Sacrificium Mithriacum (the sacrifice of the bull) is in its religious representation very often flanked by the two Dadophores, Cautes and Cautopates, one with a raised and the other with a lowered torch. They represent brothers who reveal their character through the symbolic position of the torch. Cumont connects them, not without meaning, with the sepulchral \u201cerotes\u201d who as genii with the reversed torches have traditional meaning. The one is supposed to stand for death and the other for life. I cannot refrain from mentioning the similarity between the Sacrificium Mithriacum (where the sacrificed bull in the centre is flanked on both sides by Dadophores) to the Christian sacrifice of the lamb (ram). The Crucified is also traditionally flanked by the two thieves, one of whom ascends to Paradise, while the other descends to Hell.[396] The idea of the mortal and the immortal seems to have passed also into the Christian worship. Semitic gods are often represented as flanked by two Paredroi; for example, Baal of Edessa, accompanied by Aziz and Monimoz (Baal as the Sun, accompanied by Mars and Mercury, as expressed in astronomical teachings). According to the Chaldean view, the gods are grouped into triads. In this circle of ideas belongs also the Trinity, the idea of the triune God, in which Christ must be considered in his unity with the Father and the Holy Ghost. So, too, do the two thieves belong inwardly to Christ. The two Dadophores are, as Cumont points out, nothing but offshoots[397] from the chief figure of Mithra, to whom belongs a mysterious threefold character. According to an account of Dionysus Areopagita, the magicians celebrated a festival, \u201c\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03af\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d[398][399] An observation likewise referring to the Trinity is made by Plutarch concerning Ormuzd: \u03c4\u03c1\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03be\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.[400] The Trinity, as three different states of the unity, is also a Christian thought.",
