{"paragraph": "One is somewhat disappointed at meeting here, instead of the expected impression of reality, rather a small intermezzo, a flirtation. Nevertheless, one of the officers, the singer, had made a great impression (il m\u2019avait fait beaucoup d\u2019impression). The remark at the close of the description, \u201csans songer \u00e0 rien de plus s\u00e9rieux qu\u2019\u00e0 la beaut\u00e9 des officiers,\u201d and so on, diminishes the seriousness of the impression, it is true. The assumption, however, that the impression openly influenced the mood very much, is supported by the fact that a poem upon a subject of such an erotic character came forth immediately, \u201cBrine, wine and damsels fine,\u201d and in the singer\u2019s honor. One is only too easily inclined to take such an impression lightly, and one admits so gladly the statements of the participators when they represent everything as simple and not at all serious. I dwell upon this impression at length, because it is important to know that an erotic impression after such an introversion, has a deep effect and is undervalued, possibly, by Miss Miller. The suddenly passing sickness is obscure and needs a psychologic interpretation which cannot be touched upon here because of lack of data. The phenomena now to be described can only be explained as arising from a disturbance which reaches to the very depths of her being.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious"}
