1,Accuracy,Beginner,What is the basic definition of a 'Culture Code' according to Rapaille?,hf.co/bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF:Q5_K_L,"According to Clotaire Rapaille, a ""Culture Code"" refers to the unique set of unconscious memories, emotions, and associations that are linked to a particular culture or market, which in turn shape its values, behaviors, and preferences. These codes are thought to be imprinted on individuals from a young age through cultural conditioning and are often rooted in early childhood experiences.

In essence, Rapaille's Culture Code methodology suggests that each culture has a unique set of underlying meanings, symbols, and associations that influence the way people think, feel, and behave.",,
2,Accuracy,Beginner,What was Rapaille's key insight about how cultural imprints form in early childhood?,hf.co/bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF:Q5_K_L,"According to Clotaire Rapaille, his Culture Code methodology reveals that cultural imprints are formed through a combination of experiences and associations with objects, people, and events during the first seven years of life. Specifically, he suggests that these early experiences ""encode"" emotional connections and meaning onto various stimuli, such as food (e.g., chocolate), colors, sounds, and other sensory inputs.

In this way, cultural imprints are created through a process of associative learning, where a child's brain links certain objects or concepts to emotions, memories, and other associations. These early experiences and associations then shape the individual's subsequent perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors in relation to those stimuli, influencing their worldview and cultural identity.

In essence, Rapaille's key insight is that cultural imprints are formed through an early childhood ""programming"" process, where a person's brain creates lasting connections between sensory inputs and emotional experiences.",,
