    "Psychology of the Unconscious by Jung",
    "AN INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOANALYSIS AND ANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGY",
    "When Professor Freud of Vienna made his early discoveries in the realm\nof the neuroses, and announced that the basis and origin of the various\nsymptoms grouped under the terms hysteria and neuroses lay in\nunfulfilled desires and wishes, unexpressed and unknown to the patient\nfor the most part, and concerned chiefly with the sexual instinct, it\nwas not realized what far-reaching influence this unpopular and bitterly\nattacked theory would exert on the understanding of human life in\ngeneral.",
    "For this theory has so widened in its scope that its application has now\nextended beyond a particular group of pathologic states.",
    "It has in fact\nled to a new evaluation of the whole conduct of human life; a new\ncomprehension has developed which explains those things which formerly\nwere unexplained, and there is offered an understanding not only of the\nsymptoms of a neurosis and the phenomena of conduct but the product of\nthe mind as expressed in myths and religions.",
    "This amazing growth has proceeded steadily in an ever-widening fashion\ndespite opposition as violent as any of which we have knowledge in the\npast.",
    "The criticism originally directed towards the little understood\nand much disliked sexual conception now includes the further teachings\nof a psychology which by the application to it of such damning phrases\nas mystical, metaphysical and sacrilegious, is condemned as\nunscientific.",
    "To add to the general confusion and misunderstanding surrounding this\nnew school of thought there has arisen a division amongst the leaders\nthemselves, so that there now exist two schools led respectively by\nProfessor Sigmund Freud of Vienna and Dr. Carl Jung of Zurich, referred\nto in the literature as the Vienna School and the Zurich School.",
    "It is very easy to understand that criticism and opposition should\ndevelop against a psychology so difficult of comprehension, and so\ndisturbing to the ideas which have been held by humanity for ages; a\npsychology which furthermore requires a special technique as well as an\nobserver trained to recognize and appreciate in psychologic phenomena a\nverification of the statement that there is no such thing as chance, and\nthat every act and every expression has its own meaning, determined by\nthe inner feelings and wishes of the individual.",
    "It is not a simple matter to come out boldly and state that every\nindividual is to a large extent the determiner of his own destiny, for\nonly by poets and philosophers has this idea been put forth—not by\nscience; and it is a brave act to make this statement with full\nconsciousness of all its meaning, and to stand ready to prove it by\nscientific reasoning and procedure.",
    "Developed entirely through empirical investigation and through an\nanalysis of individual cases, Freudian psychology seems particularly to\nbelong to that conception of Max Müller’s that “An empirical\nacquaintance with facts rises to a scientific knowledge of facts as soon\nas the mind discovers beneath the multiplicity of single productions the\nunity of an organic system.”[1]",
    "Psychoanalysis is the name given to the method developed for reaching\ndown into the hidden depths of the individual to bring to light the\nunderlying motives and determinants of his symptoms and attitudes, and\nto reveal the unconscious tendencies which lie behind actions and\nreactions and which influence development and determine the relations of\nlife itself.",
    "The result of digging down into the hidden psyche has been\nto produce a mass of material from below the threshold of consciousness,\nso astonishing and disturbing and out of relation with the previously\nheld values, as to arouse in any one unfamiliar with the process the\nstrongest antagonism and criticism.",
    "Although originally studied only as a therapeutic method for the sick it\nwas soon realized through an analysis of normal people how slight were\nthe differences in the content of the unconscious of the sick and of the\nnormal.",
    "The differences observed were seen to be rather in the reactions\nto life and to the conflicts produced by contending forces in the\nindividual.",
    "These conflicts, usually not fully perceived by the individual, and\nhaving to do with objectionable desires and wishes that are not in\nkeeping with the conscious idea of self, produce marked effects which\nare expressed either in certain opinions, prejudices, attitudes of\nconduct, faulty actions, or in some definite pathologic symptom.",
    "As Dr.\nJung says, he who remains healthy has to struggle with the same\ncomplexes that cause the neurotic to fall ill.",
    "In a valuable book called “The Neighbor,” written by the late Professor\nN. Shaler of Harvard University, there occurs this very far-reaching\nstatement: “It is hardly too much to say that all the important errors\nof conduct, all the burdens of men or of societies are caused by the\ninadequacies in the association of the primal animal emotions with those\nmental powers which have been so rapidly developed in mankind.”",
    "This statement, reached by a process of reasoning and a method of\nthought and study entirely different from psychoanalysis, nevertheless\nso completely expresses in brief form the very basis of the postulates\ndeveloped through psychoanalysis that I quote it here.",
    "Such a statement\nmade in the course of a general examination of human relations does not\narouse opposition nor seem to be so difficult of acceptance.",
    "It appears\nto be the individual application of these conceptions that has roused\nsuch bitter antagonism and violent denunciations.",
    "Rightly understood and used, psychoanalysis may be compared to surgery,\nfor psychoanalysis stands in the same relation to the personality as\nsurgery does to the body, and they aim at parallel results.",
    "It is well recognized that in the last analysis nature is the real\nphysician, the healer of wounds; but prior to the development of our\nmodern asepsis and surgical technique the healing produced by nature was\nmost often of a very faulty and imperfect type—hideous scars, distorted\nand crippled limbs, with functions impaired or incapacitated, resulted\nfrom the wounds, or else nature was unable to cope with the hurt and the\ninjured one succumbed.",
    "Science has been steadily working for centuries with the aim of\nunderstanding nature and finding means to aid and co-operate with her so\nthat healing could take place with the least possible loss of function\nor permanent injury to the individual.",
    "Marvelous results have rewarded\nthese persistent efforts, as the brilliant achievements of surgery\nplainly indicate.",
    "Meantime, however, little thought was given to the possibility of any\nscientific method being available to help man overcome the wounds and\nconflicts taking place in his soul, hurts which retarded his development\nand progress as a personality, and which frequently in the struggle\nresulted in physical pains and symptoms of the most varied character.\n",
    "That was left solely to religion and metaphysics.",
    "Now, however, this\nsame assistance that surgery has given to the physical body,\npsychoanalysis attempts to give to the personality.",
    "That it cannot\nalways succeed is as much to be expected, and more, than that surgery\ndoes not always succeed, for the analytic work requires much of the\nindividual.",
    "No real result can be attained if he has not already\ndeveloped a certain quality of character and intelligence which makes it\npossible for him to submit himself to a facing of his naked soul, and to\nthe pain and suffering which this often entails.",
    "Here, as in no other\nrelation in life, an absolute truth and an absolute honesty are the only\nbasis of action, since deception of any kind deceives no one but the\nindividual himself and acts as a boomerang, defeating his own aims.",
    "Such deep searching and penetrating into the soul is not something to be\nundertaken lightly nor to be considered a trivial or simple matter, and\nthe fact is that where a strong compulsion is lacking, such as sickness\nor a situation too difficult to meet, much courage is required to\nundertake it.",
    "In order to understand this psychology which is pervading all realms of\nthought and seems destined to be a new psychological-philosophical\nsystem for the understanding and practical advancement of human life, it\nwill be necessary to go somewhat into detail regarding its development\nand present status.",
    "For in this new direction lies its greatest value\nand its greatest danger.",
    "The beginnings of this work were first published in 1895 in a book\nentitled “Studien über Hysterie,” and contained the joint investigations\ninto hysteria of Dr. Breuer of Vienna and his pupil Dr. Sigmund Freud.\n",
    "The results of their investigations seemed to show that the various\nsymptoms grouped under the title of hysteria were the result of\nemotionally colored reminiscences which, all unknown to the conscious\nwaking self, were really actively expressing themselves through the\nsurrogate form of symptoms and that these experiences, although\nforgotten by the patient, could be reproduced and the emotional content\ndischarged.",
    "Hypnosis was the means used to enable the physician to penetrate deeply\ninto the forgotten memories, for it was found through hypnosis that\nthese lost incidents and circumstances were not really lost at all but\nonly dropped from consciousness, and were capable of being revived when\ngiven the proper stimuli.",
    "The astonishing part about it was that with\nthe revival of these memories and their accompanying painful and\ndisturbing emotions, the symptoms disappeared.",
    "This led naturally to the\nconclusion that these symptoms were dependent upon some emotional\ndisturbance or psychic trauma which had been inadequately expressed, and\nthat in order to cure the patient one merely had to establish the\nconnection between the memory and the emotions which properly belonged\nto it, letting the emotion work itself out through a reproduction of the\nforgotten scene.",
    "With further investigation Freud found that hypnosis was unnecessary for\nthe revival of the forgotten experiences, and that it was possible to\nobtain the lost emotional material in the conscious and normal state.\n",
    "For this purpose the patient was encouraged to assume a passive,\nnon-critical attitude and simply let his thoughts flow, speaking of\nwhatever came into his mind, holding nothing back.",
    "During this free and\neasy discussion of his life and conditions, directed by the law of\nassociation of ideas, reference was invariably made to the experiences\nor thoughts which were the most affective and disturbing elements.",
    "It\nwas seen to be quite impossible to avoid this indirect revelation\nbecause of the strength of the emotions surrounding these ideas and the\neffect of the conscious wish to repress unpleasant feelings.",
    "This\nimportant group of ideas or impressions, with the feelings and emotions\nclustered around them which are betrayed through this process, was\ncalled by Jung a _complex_.",
    "However, with the touching of the _complex_ which always contains\nfeelings and emotions so painful or unpleasant as to be unacceptable to\nconsciousness, and which are therefore repressed and hidden, great\ndifficulties appeared, for very often the patient came to a sudden stop\nand could apparently recall nothing more.",
    "Memory gaps were frequent,\nrelations twisted, etc.",
    "Evidently some force banished these memories so\nthat the person was quite honest in saying that he could remember\nnothing or that there was nothing to tell.",
    "This kind of forgetfulness\nwas called _repression_, and is the normal mechanism by which nature\nprotects the individual from such painful feelings as are caused by\nunpleasant and unacceptable experiences and thoughts, the recognition of\nhis egoistic nature, and the often quite unbearable conflict of his\nweaknesses with his feelings of idealism.",
    "At this early time great attention was given towards developing a\ntechnique which would render more easy the reproduction of these\nforgotten memories, for with the abandonment of hypnosis it was seen\nthat some unknown active force was at work which not only banished\npainful memories and feelings, but also prevented their return; this was\ncalled _resistance_.",
    "This resistance was found to be the important\nmechanism which interfered with a free flow of thought and produced the\ngreatest difficulty in the further conduct of the analysis.",
    "It appeared\nunder various guises and frequently manifested itself in intellectual\nobjections based on reasoning ground, in criticism directed towards the\nanalyst, or in criticism of the method itself, and finally, often in a\ncomplete blocking of expression, so that until the resistance was broken\nnothing more could be produced.",
    "It was necessary then to find some aid by which these resistances could\nbe overcome and the repressed memories and feelings revived and set\nfree.",
    "For it was proven again and again that even though the person was\nnot at all aware of concealing within himself some emotionally\ndisturbing feeling or experience with which his symptoms were\nassociated, yet such was the fact, and that under proper conditions this\nmaterial could be brought into consciousness.",
    "This realm where these\nunknown but disturbing emotions were hidden was called the\n“Unconscious”—the “Unconscious” also being a name used arbitrarily to\nindicate all that material of which the person is not aware at the given\ntime—the not-conscious.",
    "This term is used very loosely in Freudian psychology and is not\nintended to provoke any academic discussion but to conform strictly to\nthe dictionary classification of a “negative concept which can neither\nbe described nor defined.”",
    "To say that an idea or feeling is unconscious\nmerely means to indicate that the individual is unaware at that time of\nits existence, or that all the material of which he is unaware at a\ngiven time is unconscious.",
    "With the discovery of the significance in relation to hysteria of these\nvaried experiences and forgotten memories which always led into the\nerotic realm and usually were carried far back into early childhood, the\ntheory of an infantile sexual trauma as a cause of this neurosis\ndeveloped.",
    "Contrary to the usual belief that children have no sexuality\nand that only at puberty does it suddenly arise, it was definitely shown\nthat there was a very marked kind of sexuality among children of the\nmost tender years, entirely instinctive and capable of producing a grave\neffect on the entire later life.",
    "However, further investigations carried into the lives of normal people\ndisclosed quite as many psychic and sexual traumas in their early\nchildhood as in the lives of the patients; therefore, the conception of\nthe “infantile sexual trauma” as the etiological factor was abandoned in\nfavor of “the infantilism of sexuality” itself.",
    "In other words, it was\nsoon realized that many of the sexual traumas which were placed in their\nearly childhood by these patients, did not really exist except in their\nown phantasies and probably were produced as a defence against the\nmemories of their own childish sexual activities.",
    "These experiences led\nto a deep investigation into the nature of the child’s sexuality and\ndeveloped the ideas which Freud incorporated in a work called “Three\nContributions to the Sexual Theory.”",
    "He found so many variations and\nmanifestations of sexual activity even among young children that he\nrealized that this activity was the normal, although entirely\nunconscious, expression of the child’s developing life, and while not\ncomparable to the adult sexuality, nevertheless produced a very definite\ninfluence and effect on the child’s life.",
    "These childish expressions of this instinct he called “polymorphous\nperverse,” because in many ways they resembled the various abnormalities\ncalled perversions when found among adults under certain conditions.",
    "In the light of these additional investigations Freud was led to change\nhis formulation, for instead of the symptoms of the neurotic patient\nbeing due to definite sexual experiences, they seemed to be determined\nby his reactions towards his own sexual constitution and the kind of\nrepression to which these instincts were subjected.",
    "Perhaps one of the greatest sources of misunderstanding and difficulty\nin this whole subject lies in the term sexuality, for Freud’s conception\nof this is entirely different from that of the popular sense.",
    "He\nconceives sexuality to be practically synonymous with the word _love_\nand to include under this term all those tender feelings and emotions\nwhich have had their origin in a primitive erotic source, even if now\ntheir primary aim is entirely lost and another substituted for it.",
    "It\nmust also be borne in mind that Freud strictly emphasizes the psychic\nside of sexuality and its importance, as well as the somatic expression.",
    "Therefore, to understand Freud’s theories, his very broad conception of\nthe term sexual must never be forgotten.",
    "Through this careful investigation of the psychic life of the\nindividual, the tremendous influence and importance of phantasy-making\nfor the fate was definitely shown.",
    "It was discovered that the indulgence\nin day-dreams and phantasies was practically universal not only among\nchildren but among adults, that even whole lives were being lived out in\na phantastic world created by the dreamer, a world wherein he could\nfulfil all those wishes and desires which were found to be too difficult\nor impossible to satisfy in the world of reality.",
    "Much of this phantasy thinking was seen to be scarcely conscious, but\narose from unrealized wishes, desires and strivings which could only\nexpress themselves through veiled symbols in the form of phantastic\nstructures not understood, nor fully recognized.",
    "Indeed, it is perhaps\none of the most common human experiences to find “queer thoughts,”\nundesired ideas and images, forcing themselves upon one’s attention to\nsuch an extent that the will has to be employed to push them out of\nmind.",
    "It is not unusual to discover long-forgotten impressions of\nchildhood assuming a phantastic shape in memory, and dwelt upon as\nthough they were still of importance.",
    "This material afforded a rich field for the searchers into the soul, for\nthrough the operation of the law of association of ideas these\nphantastic products, traced back to their origin, revealed the fact that\ninstead of being meaningless or foolish, they were produced by a\ndefinite process, and arose from distinct wishes and desires which\nunconsciously veiled themselves in these mysterious forms and pictures.",
    "It is conceded that the most completely unconscious product of an\nindividual is his dream, and therefore Professor Freud turned his\nattention from phantasies and day-dreams to the investigation of the\nnightly dreams of his patients to discover whether they would throw\nlight upon the painful feelings and ideas repressed out of\nconsciousness, and therefore inaccessible to direct revelation.",
    "This brilliant idea soon led to a rich fruiting, for it became evident\nthat contrary to the usual conception that the dream is a phantastic and\nabsurd jumble of heterogeneous fragments, having no real relation to the\nlife of the individual, it is full of meaning.",
    "In fact, it is usually\nconcerned with the problem of life most pressing at the time, which\nexpresses itself not directly, but in symbolic form so as to be\nunrecognized.",
    "In this way the individual gains an expression and\nfulfilment of his unrealized wish or desire.",
    "This discovery of the symbolic nature of the dream and the phantasy was\nbrought about entirely through the associative method and developed\nempirically through investigations of the dreams of many people.",
    "In this\nmanner it became evident that certain ideas and objects which recurred\nagain and again in the dreams and phantasies of different people were\ndefinitely associated with certain unconscious or unrecognized wishes\nand desires, and were repeatedly used by the mind to express these\nmeanings where a direct form was repressed and unallowed.",
    "Thus certain\ndream expressions and figures were in a general way considered to be\nrather definite symbols of these repressed ideas and feelings found in\nthe unconscious.",
    "Through a comparative and parallel study it soon\nappeared that there was a similar mechanism at work in myths and fairy\ntales and that the relationship between the dreams and phantasies of an\nindividual and the myths and folk tales of a people was so close that\nAbraham could say that the myth is a fragment of the infantile soul life\nof the race and the dream is the myth of the individual.",
    "Thus through relating his dreams the patient himself furnished the most\nimportant means of gaining access to the unconscious and disturbing\ncomplexes with which his symptoms were connected.",
    "Besides the dream analysis the patient furnished other means of\nrevelation of his complexes—his mannerisms and unconscious acts, his\nopening remarks to his physician, his emotional reactions to certain\nideas; in short the whole behavior and verbal expressions of the\nindividual reveal his inner nature and problems.",
    "Through all this work it became clear that in the emotional nature lay\nthe origin not only of the various nervous illnesses themselves, but\nalso of the isolated symptoms and individual idiosyncrasies and\npeculiarities which are the part of all humanity and that the pathogenic\ncause of the disturbances lies not in the ignorance of individuals, but\nin those inner resistances which are the underlying basis of this\nignorance.",
    "Therefore the aim of the therapy became not merely the relief of the\nignorance but the searching out and combating of these resistances.",
    "It becomes evident from even this brief description of the analytic\nprocedure that we are dealing with a very complex and delicate material,\nand with a technique which needs to make definite use of all influences\navailable for the help of the patient.",
    "It has long been recognized that\nthe relation established between physician and patient has a great\neffect upon the medical assistance which he is able to render—in other\nwords, if a confidence and personal regard developed in the patient\ntowards the physician, the latter’s advice was just so much more\nefficacious.",
    "This personal feeling has been frankly recognized and made\nof distinct service in psychoanalytic treatment under the name of\n_transference_.",
    "It is through the aid of this definite relationship\nwhich must be established in the one being analyzed towards the analyst\nthat it is possible to deal with the unconscious and organized\nresistances which so easily blind the individual and render the\nacceptance of the new valuations very difficult to the raw and sensitive\nsoul.",
    "Freud’s emphasis upon the rôle of the sexual instinct in the production\nof the neurosis and also in its determining power upon the personality\nof the normal individual does not imply that he does not also recognize\nother determinants at the root of human conduct, as for instance, the\ninstinct for preservation of life and the ego principle itself.",
    "But\nthese motives are not so violently forbidden and repressed as the sexual\nimpulse, and therefore, because of that repressive force and the\nstrength of the impulse he considers this primary in its influence upon\nthe human being.",
    "The importance of this instinct upon human life is clearly revealed by\nthe great place given to it under the name of love in art, literature,\npoetry, romance and all beauty from the beginning of recorded time.\n",
    "Viewed in this light it cannot seem extraordinary that a difficulty or\ndisturbance in this emotional field should produce such far-reaching\nconsequences for the individual.",
    "The sexual impulse is often compared\nwith that of hunger, and this craving and need lying in all humanity is\ncalled by Freud _libido_.",
    "THE OEDIPUS PROBLEM",
    "With further investigations into the nature of the repressed complexes a\nvery astonishing situation was revealed.",
    "The parental influence on\nchildren is something so well recognized and understood that to call\nattention to it sounds much like a banality.",
    "However, here an\nextraordinary discovery was made, for in tracing out the feelings and\nemotions of adults it became evident that this influence was paramount\nnot only for children but for adults as well; that the entire direction\nof lives was largely determined quite unconsciously by the parental\nassociations, and that, although adults, the emotional side of their\nnature was still infantile in type and demanded unconsciously the\ninfantile or childish relations.",
    "Freud traces out the commencement of the infantile attachment for the\nparents in this wise.",
    "In the beginning the child derives its first satisfaction and pleasure\nfrom the mother in the form of nutrition and care for its wants.",
    "In this\nfirst act of suckling Freud sees already a kind of sexual pleasure, for\nhe apparently identifies the pleasure principle and the sexual instinct\nand considers that the former is primarily rooted in the latter.",
    "At this\nearly time commence such various infantile actions unconnected with\nnutrition as thumbsucking, various movements of the body as rubbing,\nboring, pulling and other manifestations of a definite interest in its\nown body, a delight in nakedness, the pleasure exhibited in inflicting\npain on some object and its opposite, the pleasure from receiving pain.\n",
    "All of these afford the child pleasure and satisfaction, and because\nthey seem analogous to certain perversions in adults they are called by\nFreud the “polymorphous perverse sexuality” of childhood.",
    "The character\nof these instinctive actions which have nothing to do with any other\nperson, and through which the child attains pleasure from its own body,\ncaused Freud to term this phase of life as autoerotic after Havelock\nEllis.",
    "However, with the growth of the child there is a parallel\ndevelopment of the psychic elements of its sexual nature and now the\nmother, the original object of its love, primarily determined by its\nhelplessness and need, acquires a new valuation.",
    "The beginnings of the\nneed for a love object to satisfy the craving or libido of the child are\nearly in evidence and, following along sex lines in general, the little\nson prefers the mother and the daughter the father after the usual\npreference of the parents.",
    "At this early time children feel deeply the enormous importance of their\nparents and their entire world is bounded by the family circle.",
    "All the\nelements of the ego which the child possesses have now become manifest;\nlove, jealousy, curiosity, hate, etc., and those instincts are directed\nin the greatest degree towards the objects of their libido, namely the\nparents.",
    "With the growing ego of the child there is a development of\nstrong wishes and desires demanding satisfaction which can only be\ngratified by the mother; therefore there is aroused in the small son the\nfeeling of jealousy and anger towards the father in whom he sees a rival\nfor the affection of the mother and whom he would like to replace.",
    "This\ndesire in the soul of the child Freud calls the _Oedipus complex_ in\nrecognition of its analogy to the tragedy of King Oedipus who was drawn\nby his fate to kill his father and win his mother for a wife.",
    "Freud\npresents this as the _nuclear complex_ of every neurosis.",
    "At the basis of this complex, some trace of which can be found in every\nperson, Freud sees a definite incest wish towards the mother which only\nlacks the quality of consciousness.",
    "Because of moral reactions this wish\nis quickly subjected to repression through the operation of the “incest\nbarrier,” a postulate he compares to the incest taboo found among\ninferior peoples.",
    "At this time the child is beginning to develop its\ntypical sexual curiosity expressed by the question, “Where do I come\nfrom?”",
    "The interest and investigation of the child into this problem,\naided by observations and deductions from various actions and attitudes\nof the parents, who have no idea of the watchfulness of the child, lead\nhim, because of his imperfect knowledge and immature development, into\nmany false theories and ideas of birth.",
    "These infantile sexual theories\nare held by Freud to be determinative in the development of the child’s\ncharacter and also for the contents of the unconscious as expressed in a\nfuture neurosis.",
    "These various reactions of the child and his sexual curiosity are\nentirely normal and unavoidable, and if his development proceeds in an\norderly fashion then, at the time of definite object choice he will pass\nsmoothly over from the limitations of the family attachment out into the\nworld and find therein his independent existence.",
    "However, if the libido remains fixed on the first chosen object so that\nthe growing individual is unable to tear himself loose from these\nfamilial ties, then the incestuous bond is deepened with the developing\nsexual instinct and its accompanying need of a love object, and the\nentire future of the young personality endangered.",
    "For with the\ndevelopment of the incestuous bond the natural repressions deepen\nbecause the moral censor cannot allow these disturbing relations to\nbecome clear to the individual.",
    "Therefore, the whole matter is repressed\nmore deeply into the unconscious, and even a feeling of positive enmity\nand repulsion towards the parents is often developed in order to conceal\nand over-compensate for the impossible situation actually present.",
    "This persistence of the attachment of the libido to the original object,\nand the inability to find in this a suitable satisfaction for the adult\nneed, interferes with the normal development of the psycho-sexual\ncharacter, and it is due to this that the adult retains that\n“infantilism of sexuality” which plays so great a rôle in determining\nthe instability of the emotional life which so frequently leads into the\ndefinite neuroses.",
    "These were the conclusions reached and the ground on which Freudian\npsychology rested, regarding the etiology of the neurosis, and the\ntendencies underlying normal human mechanisms, when Dr. Carl Jung, the\nmost prominent of Freud’s disciples, and the leader of the Zurich\nschool, found himself no longer able to agree with Freud’s findings in\ncertain particulars, although the phenomena which Freud observed and the\ntechnique of psychoanalysis developed by Freud were the material on\nwhich Jung worked and the value of which he clearly emphasizes.",
    "The\ndifferences which have developed lay in his understanding and\ninterpretation of the phenomena observed.",
    "Beginning with the conception of libido itself as a term used to connote\nsexual hunger and craving, albeit the meaning of the word sexual was\nextended by Freud to embrace a much wider significance than common usage\nhas assigned it, Jung was unable to confine himself to this limitation.\n",
    "He conceived this longing, this urge or push of life as something\nextending beyond sexuality even in its wider sense.",
    "He saw in the term\nlibido a concept of unknown nature, comparable to Bergson’s élan vital,\na hypothetical energy of life, which occupies itself not only in\nsexuality but in various physiological and psychological manifestations\nsuch as growth, development, hunger, and all the human activities and\ninterests.",
    "This cosmic energy or urge manifested in the human being he\ncalls libido and compares it with the energy of physics.",
    "Although\nrecognizing, in common with Freud as well as with many others, the\nprimal instinct of reproduction as the basis of many functions and\npresent-day activities of mankind no longer sexual in character he\nrepudiates the idea of still calling them sexual, even though their\ndevelopment was a growth originally out of the sexual.",
    "Sexuality and its\nvarious manifestations Jung sees as most important channels occupied by\nlibido, but not the exclusive ones through which libido flows.",
    "This is an energic concept of life; and from this viewpoint this\nhypothetical energy of life or libido is a living power used\ninstinctively by man in all the automatic processes of his functioning;\nsuch very processes being but different manifestations of this energy.\n",
    "By virtue of its quality of mobility and change man, through his\nunderstanding and intelligence, has the power consciously to direct and\nuse his libido in definite and desired ways.",
    "In this conception of Jung will be seen an analogy to Bergson, who\nspeaks of “this change, this movement and becoming, this self-creation,\ncall it what you will, as the very stuff and reality of our being.",
    "”[2]",
    "In developing the energic conception of libido and separating it from\nFreud’s sexual definition, Jung makes possible the explanation of\ninterest in general, and provides a working concept by which not only\nthe specifically sexual, but the general activities and reactions of man\ncan be understood.",
    "If a person complains of no longer having interest in his work or of\nlosing interest in his surroundings, then one understands that his\nlibido is withdrawn from this object and that in consequence the object\nitself seems no longer attractive, whereas, as a matter of fact, the\nobject itself is exactly the same as formerly.",
    "In other words, it is the\nlibido that we bestow upon an object that makes it attractive and\ninteresting.",
    "The causes for the withdrawal of libido may be various and are usually\nquite different from those that the persons offer in explanation.",
    "It is\nthe task of psychoanalysis to discover the real reasons, which are\nusually hidden and unknown.",
    "On the other hand, when an individual\nexhibits an exaggerated interest or places an over-emphasis upon an idea\nor situation, then we know there is too much libido here and that we may\nfind as a consequence a corresponding depletion elsewhere.",
    "This leads directly into the second point of difference between Jung’s\nviews and those of Freud.",
    "This is concerned with those practically\nuniversal childish manifestations of sexuality called by Freud\n“polymorphous perverse” because of their similarity to those\nabnormalities of sexuality which occur in adults and are called\nperversions.",
    "Jung takes exception to this viewpoint.",
    "He sees in the various\nmanifestations of childhood the precursors or forerunners of the later\nfully developed sexuality, and instead of considering them perverse he\nconsiders them preliminary expressions of sexual coloring.",
    "He divides\nhuman life into three stages.",
    "The first stage up to about the third or\nfourth year, generally speaking, he calls the presexual stage, for there\nhe sees the libido or life energy occupied chiefly in the functions of\nnutrition and growth, and he draws an analogy between this period and\nthat of the caterpillar stage of the butterfly.",
    "The second stage includes the years from this time until puberty, and\nthis he speaks of as the prepubertal stage.",
    "The third period is that from puberty onward and can be considered the\ntime of maturity.",
    "It is in the earliest stage, the period of which varies greatly in\ndifferent individuals, that are fully inaugurated those various\nmanifestations which have so marked a sexual coloring that there can be\nno question of their relationship, although at that time sexuality in\nthe adult meaning of the word does not exist.",
    "Jung explains the polymorphism of these phenomena as arising from a\ngradual movement of the libido from exclusive service in the function of\nnutrition into new avenues which successively open up with the\ndevelopment of the child until the final inauguration of the sexual\nfunction proper at puberty.",
    "Normally these childish bad habits are\ngradually relinquished until the libido is entirely withdrawn from these\nimmature phases and with the ushering in of puberty for the first time\n“appears in the form of an undifferentiated sexual primitive power,\nclearly forcing the individual towards division, budding, etc.”",
    "However, if in the course of its movement from the function of nutrition\nto the sexual function the libido is arrested or retarded at any phase,\nthen a _fixation_ may result, creating a disturbance in the harmony of\nthe normal development.",
    "For, although the libido is retarded and remains\nclinging to some childish manifestation, time goes on and the physical\ngrowth of the child does not stand still.",
    "Soon a great contrast is\ncreated between the infantile manifestations of the emotional life and\nthe needs of the more adult individual, and the foundation is thus\nprepared for either the development of a definite neurosis or else for\nthose weaknesses of character or symptomatic disturbances which are not\nsufficiently serious to be called a neurosis.",
    "One of the most active and important forms of childish libido occupation\nis in phantasy making.",
    "The child’s world is one of imagery and\nmake-believe where he can create for himself that satisfaction and\nenjoyment which the world of reality so often denies.",
    "As the child grows\nand real demands of life are made upon him it becomes increasingly\nnecessary that his libido be taken away from his phantastic world and\nused for the required adaptation to reality needed by his age and\ncondition, until finally for the adult the freedom of the whole libido\nis necessary to meet the biological and cultural demands of life.",
    "Instead of thus employing the libido in the real world, however, certain\npeople never relinquish the seeking for satisfaction in the shadowy\nworld of phantasy and even though they make certain attempts at\nadaptation they are halted and discouraged by every difficulty and\nobstacle in the path of life and are easily pulled back into their inner\npsychic world.",
    "This condition is called a state of _introversion_.",
    "It is\nconcerned with the past and the reminiscences which belong thereto.\n",
    "Situations and experiences which should have been completed and finished\nlong ago are still dwelt upon and lived with.",
    "Images and matters which\nwere once important but which normally have no significance for their\nlater age are still actively influencing their present lives.",
    "The nature\nand character of these phantasy products are legion, and are easily\nrecognized in the emotional attitudes and pretensions, the childish\nillusions and exaggerations, the prejudices and inconsistencies which\npeople express in manifold forms.",
    "The actual situation is inadequately\nfaced; small matters are reacted towards in an exaggerated manner; or\nelse a frivolous attitude is maintained where real seriousness is\ndemanded.",
    "In other words, there is clearly manifested an inadequate\npsychic adaptation towards reality which is quite to be expected from\nthe child, but which is very discordant in the adult.",
    "The most important of these past influences is that of the parents.\n",
    "Because they are the first objects of the developing childish love, and\nafford the first satisfaction and pleasure to the child, they become the\nmodels for all succeeding efforts, as Freud has worked out.",
    "This he\ncalled the _nuclear_ or _root complex_ because this influence was so\npowerful it seemed to be the determining factor in all later\ndifficulties in the life of the individual.",
    "In this phase of the problem lies the third great difference between\nJung’s interpretation of the observed phenomena and that of Freud.",
    "Jung definitely recognizes that there are many neurotic persons who\nclearly exhibited in their childhood the same neurotic tendencies that\nare later exaggerated.",
    "Also that an almost overwhelming effect on the\ndestiny of these children is exercised by the influence of the parents,\nthe frequent over-anxiety or tenderness, the lack of sympathy or\nunderstanding, in other words, the complexes of the parent reacting upon\nthe child and producing in him love, admiration, fear, distrust, hate,\nrevolt.",
    "The greater the sensitiveness and impressionability of the\nchild, the more he will be stamped with the familial environment, and\nthe more he will unconsciously seek to find again in the world of\nreality the model of his own small world with all the pleasures and\nsatisfactions, or disappointments and unhappinesses with which it was\nfilled.",
    "This condition to be sure is not a recognized or a conscious one, for\nthe individual may think himself perfectly free from this past influence\nbecause he is living in the real world, and because actually there is a\ngreat difference between the present conditions and that of his childish\npast.",
    "He sees all this, intellectually, but there is a wide gap between\nthe intellectual grasp of a situation and the emotional development, and\nit is the latter realm wherein lies the disharmony.",
    "However, although\nmany ideas and feelings are connected with the parents, analysis reveals\nvery often that they are only subjective and that in reality they bear\nlittle resemblance to the actual past situation.",
    "Therefore, Jung speaks\nno longer of the real father and mother but uses the term imago or image\nto represent the father or mother, because the feelings and phantasies\nfrequently do not deal with the real parents but with the distorted and\nsubjective image created by the imagination of the individual.",
    "Following this distinction Jung sees in the Oedipus complex of Freud\nonly a symbol for the “childish desire towards the parents and for the\nconflict which this craving evokes,” and cannot accept the theory that\nin this early stage of childhood the mother has any real sexual\nsignificance for the child.",
    "The demands of the child upon the mother, the jealousy so often\nexhibited, are at first connected with the rôle of the mother as\nprotector, caretaker and supplier of nutritive wants, and only later,\nwith the germinating eroticism, does the child’s love become admixed\nwith the developing sexual quality.",
    "The chief love objects are still the\nparents and he naturally continues to seek and to find in them\nsatisfaction for all his desires.",
    "In this way the typical conflict is\ndeveloped which in the son is directed towards the father and in the\ndaughter towards the mother.",
    "This jealousy of the daughter towards the\nmother is called the _Electra complex_ from the myth of Electra who took\nrevenge on her mother for the murder of the husband because she was in\nthis way deprived of her father.",
    "Normally as puberty is attained the child gradually becomes more or less\nfreed from his parents, and upon the degree in which this is\naccomplished depends his health and future well-being.",
    "This demand of nature upon the young individual to free himself from the\nbonds of his childish dependency and to find in the world of reality his\nindependent existence is so imperious and dominating that it frequently\nproduces in the child the greatest struggles and severest conflicts, the\nperiod being characterized symbolically as a _self-sacrifice_ by Jung.",
    "It frequently happens that the young person is so closely bound in the\nfamily relations that it is only with the greatest difficulty that he\ncan attain any measure of freedom and then only very imperfectly, so\nthat the libido sexualis can only express itself in certain feelings and\nphantasies which clearly reveal the existence of the complex until then\nentirely hidden and unrealized.",
    "Now commences the secondary struggle\nagainst the unfilial and immoral feelings with a consequent development\nof intense resistances expressing themselves in irritation, anger,\nrevolt and antagonism against the parents, or else in an especially\ntender, submissive and yielding attitude which over-compensates for the\nrebellion and reaction held within.",
    "This struggle and conflict gives rise to the unconscious phantasy of\nself-sacrifice which really means the sacrificing of the childish\ntendencies and love type in order to free libido; for his nature demands\nthat he attain the capacity for the accomplishment of his own personal\nfulfilment, the satisfaction of which belongs to the developed man and\nwoman.",
    "This conception has been worked out in detail by Jung in the book which\nis herein presented to English readers.",
    "We now come to the most important of Jung’s conceptions in that it bears\npractically upon the treatment of certain types of the neuroses and\nstands theoretically in direct opposition to Freud’s hypothesis.",
    "While\nrecognizing fully the influence of the parents and of the sexual\nconstitution of the child, Jung refuses to see in this infantile past\nthe real cause for the later development of the illness.",
    "He definitely\nplaces the cause of the pathogenic conflict _in the present moment_ and\nconsiders that in seeking for the cause in the distant past one is only\nfollowing the desire of the patient, which is to withdraw himself as\nmuch as possible from the present important period.",
    "The conflict is produced by some important task or duty which is\nessential biologically and practically for the fulfilment of the ego of\nthe individual, but before which an obstacle arises from which he\nshrinks, and thus halted cannot go on.",
    "With this interference in the\npath of progression libido is stored up and a _regression_ takes place\nwhereby there occurs a reanimation of past ways of libido occupation\nwhich were entirely normal to the child, but which for the adult are no\nlonger of value.",
    "These regressive infantile desires and phantasies now\nalive and striving for satisfaction are converted into symptoms, and in\nthese surrogate forms obtain a certain gratification, thus creating the\nexternal manifestations of the neurosis.",
    "Therefore Jung does not ask\nfrom what psychic experience or point of fixation in childhood the\npatient is suffering, but what is the present duty or task he is\navoiding, or what obstacle in his life’s path he is unable to overcome?\nWhat is the cause of his regression to past psychic experiences?",
    "Following this theory Jung expresses the view that the elaborate\nphantasies and dreams produced by these patients are really forms of\ncompensation or artificial substitutes for the unfulfilled adaptation to\nreality.",
    "The sexual content of these phantasies and dreams is only\napparently and not actually expressive of a real sexual desire or incest\nwish, but is a regressive employment of sexual forms to symbolically\nexpress a present-day need when the attainment of the present ego demand\nseems too difficult or impossible, and no adaptation is made to what is\npossible for the individual’s capability.[3]",
    "With this statement Jung throws a new light on the work of analytic\npsychology and on the conception of the neurotic symptoms, and renders\npossible of understanding the many apparent incongruities and\nconflicting observations which have been so disturbing to the critics.",
    "It now becomes proper to ask what has been established by all this mass\nof investigation into the soul, and what is its value not only as a\ntherapeutic measure for the neurotic sufferer, but also for the normal\nhuman being?",
    "First and perhaps most important is the recognition of a definite\npsychological determinism.",
    "Instead of human life being filled with\nfoolish, meaningless or purposeless actions, errors and thoughts, it can\nbe demonstrated that no expression or manifestation of the psyche,\nhowever trifling or inconsistent in appearance, is really lawless or\nunmotivated.",
    "Only a possession of the technique is necessary in order to\nreveal, to any one desirous of knowing, the existence of the unconscious\ndeterminants of his mannerisms, trivial expressions, acts and behavior,\ntheir purpose and significance.",
    "This leads into the second fundamental conception, which is perhaps even\nless considered than the foregoing, and that is the relative value of\nthe conscious mind and thought.",
    "It is the general attitude of people to\njudge themselves by their surface motives, to satisfy themselves by\nsaying or thinking “this is what I want to do or say” or “I intended to\ndo thus and so,” but somehow what one thought, one intended to say or\nexpected to do is very often the contrary of what actually is said or\ndone.",
    "Every one has had these experiences when the gap between the\nconscious thought and action was gross enough to be observed.",
    "It is also\na well known experience to consciously desire something very much and\nwhen it is obtained to discover that this in no wise satisfied or\nlessened the desire, which was then transferred to some other object.\n",
    "Thus one became cognizant of the fact that the feeling and idea\npresented by consciousness as the desire was an error.",
    "What is the\ndifficulty in these conditions?",
    "Evidently some other directing force\nthan that of which we are aware is at work.",
    "Dr. G. Stanley Hall uses a very striking symbol when he compares the\nmind to an iceberg floating in the ocean with one-eighth visible above\nthe water and seven-eighths below—the one-eighth above being that part\ncalled conscious and the seven-eighths below that which we call the\nunconscious.",
    "The influence and controlling power of the unconscious\ndesires over our thoughts and acts are in this relative proportion.\n",
    "Faint glimmers of other motives and interests than those we accept or\nwhich we believe, often flit into consciousness.",
    "These indications, if\nstudied or valued accurately, would lead to the realization that\nconsciousness is but a single stage and but one form of expression of\nmind.",
    "Therefore its dictum is but one, often untrustworthy, approach to\nthe great question as to what is man’s actual psychic accomplishment,\nand as to what in particular is the actual soul development of the\nindividual.",
    "A further contribution of equal importance has been the empiric\ndevelopment of a dynamic theory of life; the conception that life is in\na state of flux—movement—leading either to construction or destruction.\n",
    "Through the development man has reached he has attained the power by\nmeans of his intelligence and understanding of definitely directing to a\ncertain extent this life energy or libido into avenues which serve his\ninterest and bring a real satisfaction for the present day.",
    "When man through ignorance and certain inherent tendencies fails to\nrecognize his needs or his power to fulfil them, or to adapt himself to\nthe conditions of reality of the present time, there is then produced\nthat reanimation of infantile paths by which an attempt is made to gain\nfulfilment or satisfaction through the production of symptoms or\nattitudes.",
    "The acceptance of these statements demands the recognition of the\nexistence of an infantile sexuality and the large part played by it in\nthe later life of the individual.",
    "Because of the power and imperious\ninfluence exerted by the parents upon the child, and because of the\nunconscious attachment of his libido to the original object, the mother,\nand the perseverance of this first love model in the psyche, he finds it\nvery difficult, on reaching the stage of adult development and the time\nfor seeking a love object outside of the family, to gain a satisfactory\nmodel.",
    "It is exceedingly important for parents and teachers to recognize the\nrequirements of nature, which, beginning with puberty, imperiously\ndemand of the young individual a separation of himself from the parent\nstem and the development of an independent existence.",
    "In our complex\nmodern civilization this demand of nature is difficult enough of\nachievement for the child who has the heartiest and most intelligent\nco-operation of his parents and environment—but for the one who has not\nonly to contend with his own inner struggle for his freedom but has in\naddition the resistance of his parents who would hold him in his\nchildhood at any cost, because they cannot endure the thought of his\nseparation from them, the task becomes one of the greatest magnitude.",
    "It\nis during this period when the struggle between the childish inertia and\nnature’s urge becomes so keen, that there occur the striking\nmanifestations of jealousy, criticism, irritability all usually directed\nagainst the parents, of defiance of parental authority, of runaways and\nvarious other psychic and nervous disorders known to all.",
    "This struggle, which is the first great task of mankind and the one\nwhich requires the greatest effort, is that which is expressed by Jung\nas the self-sacrifice motive—the sacrifice of the childish feelings and\ndemands, and of the irresponsibility of this period, and the assumption\nof the duties and tasks of an individual existence.",
    "It is this great theme which Jung sees as the real motive lying hidden\nin the myths and religions of man from the beginning, as well as in the\nliterature and artistic creations of both ancient and modern time, and\nwhich he works out with the greatest wealth of detail and painstaking\neffort in the book herewith presented.",
    "This necessitates a recognition and revaluation of the enormous\nimportance and influence of the ego and the sexual instinct upon the\nthought and reaction of man, and also predicates a displacement of the\npsychological point of gravity from the will and intellect to the realm\nof the emotions and feelings.",
    "The desired end is a synthesis of these\ntwo paths or the use of the intellect constructively in the service of\nthe emotions in order to gain for the best interest of the individual\nsome sort of co-operative reaction between the two.",
    "No one dealing with analytic psychology can fail to be struck by the\ntremendous and unnecessary burdens which man has placed upon himself,\nand how greatly he has increased the difficulties of adaptation by his\nrigid intellectual views and moral formulas, and by his inability to\nadmit to himself that he is actually just a human being imperfect, and\ncontaining within himself all manner of tendencies, good and bad, all\nstriving for some satisfactory goal.",
    "Further, that the refusal to see\nhimself in this light instead of as an ideal person in no way alters the\nactual condition, and that in fact, through the cheap pretense of being\nable only to consider himself as a very virtuous person, or as shocked\nand hurt when observing the “sins” of others, he actually is prevented\nfrom developing his own character and bringing his own capacities to\ntheir fullest expressions.",
    "There is frequently expressed among people the idea of how fortunate it\nis that we cannot see each other’s thoughts, and how disturbing it would\nbe if our real feelings could be read.",
    "But what is so shameful in these\nsecrets of the soul?",
    "They are in reality our own egoistic desires all\nstriving, longing, wishing for satisfaction, for happiness; those\ndesires which instinctively crave their own gratification but which can\nonly be really fulfilled by adapting them to the real world and to the\nsocial group.",
    "Why is it that it is so painful for man to admit that the prime\ninfluence in all human endeavor is found in the ego itself, in its\ndesires, wishes, needs and satisfactions, in short, in its need for\nself-expression and self-perpetuation, the evolutionary impetus in life?",
    "The basis for the unpleasantness of this idea may perhaps be found in an\ninner resistance in nature itself which forces man to include others in\nhis scheme, lest his own greedy desires should serve to destroy him.",
    "But\neven with this inner demand and all the ethical and moral teachings of\ncenturies it is everywhere evident that man has only very imperfectly\nlearned that it is to his own interest to consider his neighbor and that\nit is impossible for him to ignore the needs of the body social of which\nhe is a part.",
    "Externally, the recognition of the strength of the ego\nimpulse is objectionable because of the ideal conception that\nself-striving and so-called selfish seeking are unworthy, ignoble and\nincompatible with a desirable character and must be ignored at all cost.",
    "The futility of this attitude is to be clearly seen in the failure after\nall these centuries to even approximate it, as evidenced in our human\nrelations and institutions, and is quite as ineffectual in this realm as\nin that of sexuality where the effort to overcome this imperious\ndomination has been attempted by lowering the instinct, and seeing in it\nsomething vile or unclean, something unspeakable and unholy.",
    "Instead of\ndestroying the power of sexuality this struggle has only warped and\ndistorted, injured and mutilated the expression; for not without\ndestruction of the individual can these fundamental instincts be\ndestroyed.",
    "Life itself has needs and imperiously demands expression\nthrough the forms created.",
    "All nature answers to this freely and simply\nexcept man.",
    "His failure to recognize himself as an instrument through\nwhich the life energy is coursing and the demands of which must be\nobeyed, is the cause of his misery.",
    "Despite his possession of intellect\nand self-consciousness, he cannot without disaster to himself refuse the\ntasks of life and the fulfilment of his own needs.",
    "Man’s great task is\nthe adaptation of himself to reality and the recognition of himself as\nan instrument for the expression of life according to his individual\npossibilities.",
    "It is in his privilege as a self-creator that his highest purpose is\nfound.",
    "The value of self-consciousness lies in the fact that man is enabled to\nreflect upon himself and learn to understand the true origin and\nsignificance of his actions and opinions, that he may adequately value\nthe real level of his development and avoid being self-deceived and\ntherefore inhibited from finding his biological adaptation.",
    "He need no\nlonger be unconscious of the motives underlying his actions or hide\nhimself behind a changed exterior, in other words, be merely a series of\nreactions to stimuli as the mechanists have it, but he may to a certain\nextent become a self-creating and self-determining being.",
    "Indeed, there seems to be an impulse towards adaptation quite as Bergson\nsees it, and it would seem to be a task of the highest order to use\nintelligence to assist one’s self to work with this impulse.",
    "Through the investigation of these different avenues leading into the\nhidden depths of the human being and through the revelation of the\nmotives and influences at work there, although astonishing to the\nuninitiated, a very clear and definite conception of the actual human\nrelationship—brotherhood—of all mankind is obtained.",
    "It is this\nrecognition of these common factors basically inherent in humanity from\nthe beginning and still active, which is at once both the most hopeful\nand the most feared and disliked part of psychoanalysis.",
    "It is disliked by those individuals who have prided themselves upon\ntheir superiority and the distinction between their reactions and\nmotives and those of ordinary mankind.",
    "In other words, they attempt to\nbecome personalities through elevating themselves and lowering others,\nand it is a distinct blow to discover that beneath these pretensions lie\nthe very ordinary elements shared in common by all.",
    "On the other hand,\nto those who have been able to recognize their own weaknesses and have\nsuffered in the privacy of their own souls, the knowledge that these\nthings have not set them apart from others, but that they are the common\nproperty of all and that no one can point the finger of scorn at his\nfellow, is one of the greatest experiences of life and is productive of\nthe greatest relief.",
    "It is feared by many who realize that in these painfully acquired\nrepressions and symptoms lie their safety and their protection from\ndirectly facing and dealing with tendencies and characteristics with\nwhich they feel unable to cope.",
    "The repression and the accompanying\nsymptoms indicate a difficulty and a struggle, and in this way are a\nsort of compromise or substitute formation which permit, although only\nin a wasteful and futile manner, the activity of the repressed\ntendencies.",
    "Nevertheless, to analyze the individual back to his original\ntendencies and reveal to him the meaning of these substitute formations\nwould be a useless procedure in which truly “the last state of that man\nwould be worse than the first” if the work ceased there.",
    "The aim is not\nto destroy those barriers upon which civilized man has so painfully\nclimbed and to reduce him to his primitive state, but, where these have\nfailed or imperfectly succeeded, to help him to attain his greatest\npossibilities with less expenditure of energy, by less wasteful methods\nthan nature provides.",
    "In this achievement lies the hopeful and valuable\nside of this method—the development of the synthesis.",
    "It is hopeful\nbecause now a way is opened to deal with these primitive tendencies\nconstructively, and render their effects not only harmless but useful,\nby utilizing them in higher aims, socially and individually valuable and\nsatisfactory.",
    "This is what has occurred normally in those individuals who seem capable\nand constructive personalities; in those creative minds that give so\nmuch to the race.",
    "They have converted certain psychological tendencies\nwhich could have produced useless symptoms or destructive actions into\nvaluable productions.",
    "Indeed it is not uncommon for strong, capable\npersons to state themselves that they knew they could have been equally\ncapable of a wasteful or destructive life.",
    "This utilization of the\nenergy or libido freed by removing the repressions and the lifting of\ninfantile tendencies and desires into higher purposes and directions\nsuitable for the individual at his present status is called\n_sublimation_.",
    "It must not be understood by this discussion that geniuses or wonderful\npersonalities can be created through analysis, for this is not the aim\nof the procedure.",
    "Its purpose is to remove the inhibitions and\nrestrictions which interfere with the full development of the\npersonality, to help individuals attain to that level where they really\nbelong, and to prepare people to better understand and meet life whether\nthey are neurotic sufferers or so-called “normal people” with the\ndifficulties and peculiarities which belong to all.",
    "This reasoning and method of procedure is only new when the application\nis made to the human being.",
    "In all improvements of plants and animals\nthese general principles have been recognized and their teachings\nconstructively utilized.",
    "Luther Burbank, that plant wizard whose work is known to all the world,\nsays, “A knowledge of the battle of the tendencies within a plant is the\nvery basis of all plant improvement,” and “it is not that the work of\nplant improvement brings with it, incidentally, as people mistakenly\nthink, a knowledge of these forces, it is the knowledge of these forces,\nrather, which makes plant improvement possible.”",
    "Has this not been also the mistake of man regarding himself, and the\ncause, partly at least, of his failure to succeed in actually reaching a\nmore advanced and stable development?",
    "This recognition of man’s biological relationship to all life and the\npractical utilization of this recognition, necessitates a readjustment\nof thought and asks for an examination and reconsideration of the facts\nof human conduct which are observable by any thoughtful person.",
    "A quiet\nand progressive upheaval of old ideas has taken place and is still going\non.",
    "Analytic psychology attempts to unify and value all of the various\nphenomena of man which have been observed and noted at different times\nby isolated investigators of isolated manifestations and thus bring some\norderly sequence into the whole.",
    "It offers a method whereby the\nrelations of the human being biologically to all other living forms can\nbe established, the actual achievement of man himself adequately valued,\nand opens a vista of the possibilities of improvement in health,\nhappiness and accomplishment for the human being.",

    "INTRODUCTION",
    "Any one who can read Freud’s “Interpretation of the Dream” without\nscientific rebellion at the newness and apparently unjustified daring of\nits analytical presentation, and without moral indignation at the\nastonishing nudity of the dream interpretation, and who can allow this\nunusual array of facts to influence his mind calmly and without\nprejudice, will surely be deeply impressed at that place where Freud\ncalls to mind the fact that an individual psychologic conflict, namely,\nthe Incest Phantasy, is the essential root of that powerful ancient\ndramatic material, the Oedipus legend.",
    "The impression made by this\nsimple reference may be likened to that wholly peculiar feeling which\narises in us if, for example, in the noise and tumult of a modern street\nwe should come across an ancient relic—the Corinthian capital of a\nwalled-in column, or a fragment of inscription.",
    "Just a moment ago we\nwere given over to the noisy ephemeral life of the present, when\nsomething very far away and strange appears to us, which turns our\nattention to things of another order; a glimpse away from the incoherent\nmultiplicity of the present to a higher coherence in history.",
    "Very\nlikely it would suddenly occur to us that on this spot where we now run\nbusily to and fro a similar life and activity prevailed two thousand\nyears ago in somewhat other forms; similar passions moved mankind, and\nman was likewise convinced of the uniqueness of his existence.",
    "I would\nliken the impression which the first acquaintance with the monuments of\nantiquity so easily leaves behind to that impression which Freud’s\nreference to the Oedipus legend makes—for while we are still engaged\nwith the confusing impressions of the variability of the Individual\nSoul, suddenly there is opened a revelation of the simple greatness of\nthe Oedipus tragedy—that never extinguished light of the Grecian\ntheatre.",
    "This breadth of outlook carries in itself something of revelation.",
    "For\nus, the ancient psychology has long since been buried among the shadows\nof the past; in the schoolroom one could scarcely repress a sceptical\nsmile when one indiscreetly reckoned the comfortable matronly age of\nPenelope and the age of Jocasta, and comically compared the result of\nthe reckoning with the tragic-erotic struggles in the legend and drama.\n",
    "We did not know at that time (and who knows even to-day?)",
    "that the\nmother can be the all-consuming passion of the son, which perhaps\nundermines his whole life and tragically destroys it, so that not even\nthe magnitude of the Oedipus Fate seems one jot overdrawn.",
    "Rare and\npathologically understood cases like Ninon de Lenclos and her son[4] lie\ntoo far removed from most of us to give a living impression.",
    "But when we\nfollow the paths traced out by Freud, we arrive at a recognition of the\npresent existence of such possibilities, which, although they are too\nweak to enforce incest, are still strong enough to cause disturbances of\nconsiderable magnitude in the soul.",
    "The admission of such possibilities\nto one’s self does not occur without a great burst of moral revulsion.\n",
    "Resistances arise which only too easily dazzle the intellect, and,\nthrough that, make knowledge of self impossible.",
    "Whenever we succeed,\nhowever, in stripping feelings from more scientific knowledge, then that\nabyss which separates our age from the antique is bridged, and, with\nastonishment, we see that Oedipus is still a living thing for us.",
    "The\nimportance of such an impression should not be undervalued.",
    "We are\ntaught by this insight that there is an identity of elementary human\nconflicts existing independent of time and place.",
    "That which affected\nthe Greeks with horror still remains true, but it is true for us only\nwhen we give up a vain illusion that we are different—that is to say,\nmore moral, than the ancients.",
    "We of the present day have nearly\nsucceeded in forgetting that an indissoluble common bond binds us to the\npeople of antiquity.",
    "With this truth a path is opened to the\nunderstanding of the ancient mind; an understanding which so far has not\nexisted, and, on one side, leads to an inner sympathy, and, on the other\nside, to an intellectual comprehension.",
    "Through buried strata of the\nindividual soul we come indirectly into possession of the living mind of\nthe ancient culture, and, just precisely through that, do we win that\nstable point of view outside our own culture, from which, for the first\ntime, an objective understanding of their mechanisms would be possible.\n",
    "At least that is the hope which we get from the rediscovery of the\nOedipus problem.",
    "The enquiry made possible by Freud’s work has already resulted\nfruitfully; we are indebted to this stimulation for some bold attacks\nupon the territory of the history of the human mind.",
    "There are the works\nof Riklin,[5] Abraham,[6] Rank,[7] Maeder,[8] Jones,[9]—recently\nSilberer has joined their ranks with a beautiful investigation entitled\n“Phantasie und Mythus.",
    "”[10]",
    "We are indebted to Pfister[11] for a\ncomprehensive work which cannot be overlooked here, and which is of much\nimportance for Christian religious psychology.",
    "The leading purpose of\nthese works is the unlocking of historical problems through the\napplication of psychoanalytic knowledge; that is to say, knowledge drawn\nfrom the activity of the modern unconscious mind concerning specific\nhistorical material.",
    "I must refer the reader entirely to the specified works, in order that\nhe may gain information concerning the extent and the kind of insight\nwhich has already been obtained.",
    "The explanations are in many cases\ndubious in particulars; nevertheless, this detracts in no way from the\ntotal result.",
    "It would be significant enough if only the far-reaching\nanalogy between the psychologic structure of the historical relics and\nthe structure of the recent individual psychologic products alone were\ndemonstrated.",
    "This proof is possible of attainment for every intelligent\nperson through the work done up to this time.",
    "The analogy prevails\nespecially in symbolism, as Riklin, Rank, Maeder, and Abraham have\npointed out with illuminating examples; it is also shown in the\nindividual mechanisms of unconscious work, that is to say in repression,\ncondensation, etc., as Abraham explicitly shows.",
    "Up to the present time the psychoanalytic investigator has turned his\ninterest chiefly to the analysis of the individual psychologic problems.\n",
    "It seems to me, however, that in the present state of affairs there is a\nmore or less imperative demand for the psychoanalyst to broaden the\nanalysis of the individual problems by a comparative study of historical\nmaterial relating to them, just as Freud has already done in a masterly\nmanner in his book on “Leonardo da Vinci.”[12]",
    "For, just as the\npsychoanalytic conceptions promote understanding of the historic\npsychologic creations, so reversedly historical materials can shed new\nlight upon individual psychologic problems.",
    "These and similar\nconsiderations have caused me to turn my attention somewhat more to the\nhistorical, in the hope that, out of this, new insight into the\nfoundations of individual psychology might be won.",
    "CHAPTER I\n                  CONCERNING THE TWO KINDS OF THINKING",
    "It is a well-known fact that one of the principles of analytic\npsychology is that the dream images are to be understood symbolically;\nthat is to say, that they are not to be taken literally just as they are\npresented in sleep, but that behind them a hidden meaning has to be\nsurmised.",
    "It is this ancient idea of a dream symbolism which has\nchallenged not only criticism, but, in addition to that, the strongest\nopposition.",
    "That dreams may be full of import, and, therefore, something\nto be interpreted, is certainly neither a strange nor an extraordinary\nidea.",
    "This has been familiar to mankind for thousands of years, and,\ntherefore, seems much like a banal truth.",
    "The dream interpretations of\nthe Egyptians and Chaldeans, and the story of Joseph who interpreted\nPharaoh’s dreams, are known to every one, and the dream book of\nArtemidorus is also familiar.",
    "From countless inscribed monuments of all\ntimes and peoples we learn of foreboding dreams, of significant, of\nprophetic and also of curative dreams which the Deity sent to the sick,\nsleeping in the temple.",
    "We know the dream of the mother of Augustus, who\ndreamt she was to be with child by the Deity transformed into a snake.\n",
    "We will not heap up references and examples to bear witness to the\nexistence of a belief in the symbolism of dreams.",
    "When an idea is so\nold, and is so generally believed, it is probably true in some way, and,\nindeed, as is mostly the case, _is not literally true, but is true\npsychologically_.",
    "In this distinction lies the reason why the old fogies\nof science have from time to time thrown away an inherited piece of\nancient truth; because it was not literal but psychologic truth.",
    "For\nsuch discrimination this type of person has at no time had any\ncomprehension.",
    "From our experience, it is hardly conceivable that a God existing\noutside of ourselves causes dreams, or that the dream, eo ipso, foresees\nthe future prophetically.",
    "When we translate this into the psychologic,\nhowever, then the ancient theories sound much more reconcilable, namely,\n_the dream arises from a part of the mind unknown to us, but none the\nless important, and is concerned with the desires for the approaching\nday_.",
    "This psychologic formula derived from the ancient superstitious\nconception of dreams, is, so to speak, exactly identified with the\nFreudian psychology, which assumes a rising wish from the unconscious to\nbe the source of the dream.",
    "As the old belief teaches, the Deity or the Demon speaks in symbolic\nspeech to the sleeper, and the dream interpreter has the riddle to\nsolve.",
    "In modern speech we say this means that the dream is a _series of\nimages, which are apparently contradictory and nonsensical, but arise in\nreality from psychologic material which yields a clear meaning_.",
    "Were I to suppose among my readers a far-reaching ignorance of dream\nanalysis, then I should be obliged to illustrate this statement with\nnumerous examples.",
    "To-day, however, these things are quite well known,\nso that one must proceed carefully with every-day dream material, out of\nconsideration for a public educated in these matters.",
    "It is a special\ninconvenience that no dream can be recounted without being obliged to\nadd to it half a life’s history which affords the individual foundations\nof the dream, but there are some few typical dreams which can be told\nwithout too great a ballast.",
    "One of these is the dream of the sexual\nassault, which is especially prevalent among women.",
    "A girl sleeping\nafter an evening happily spent in dancing, dreams that a robber breaks\nopen her door noisily and stabs through her body with a lance.",
    "This\ntheme, which explains itself, has countless variations, some simple,\nsome complicated.",
    "Instead of the lance it is a sword, a dagger, a\nrevolver, a gun, a cannon, a hydrant, a watering pot; or the assault is\na burglary, a pursuit, a robbery, or it is some one hidden in the closet\nor under the bed.",
    "Or the danger may be illustrated by wild animals; for\ninstance, a horse which throws the dreamer to the ground and kicks her\nin the body with his hind foot; lions, tigers, elephants with\nthreatening trunks, and finally snakes in endless variety.",
    "Sometimes the\nsnake creeps into the mouth, sometimes it bites the breast like\nCleopatra’s legendary asp, sometimes it comes in the rôle of the\nparadisical snake, or in the variations of Franz Stuck, whose pictures\nof snakes bear the significant titles “Vice,” “Sin,” “Lust.”",
    "The mixture\nof lust and anxiety is expressed incomparably in the very atmosphere of\nthese pictures, and far more brutally, indeed, than in Mörike’s charming\npoem.",

    "All these things are simple, and need no explanation to be intelligible.\n",
    "Somewhat more complicated, but still unmistakable, is the dream of a\nwoman; she sees the triumphal arch of Constantine.",
    "A cannon stands\nbefore it, to the right of it a bird, to the left a man.",

    "These few references to the symbolic nature of dreams are perhaps\nsufficient.",
    "For whomsoever the proof may appear insufficient, and it is\ncertainly insufficient for a beginner, further evidence may be found in\nthe fundamental work of Freud, and in the works of Stekel and Rank which\nare fuller in certain particulars.",
    "We must assume here that the dream\nsymbolism is an established fact, in order to bring to our study a mind\nsuitably prepared for an appreciation of this work.",
    "We would not be\nsuccessful if we, on the contrary, were to be astonished at the idea\nthat an intellectual image can be projected into our conscious psychic\nactivity; an image which apparently obeys such wholly other laws and\npurposes than those governing the conscious psychic product.",
    "_Why are dreams symbolic?_",
    "Every “why” in psychology is divided into two\nseparate questions: first, _for what purpose are dreams symbolic_?",
    "We\nwill answer this question only to abandon it at once.",
    "Dreams are\nsymbolic in order that they can not be understood; in order that the\nwish, which is the source of the dream, may remain unknown.",
    "The question\nwhy this is so and not otherwise, leads us out into the far-reaching\nexperiences and trains of thought of the Freudian psychology.",
    "Here the second question interests us, viz., _",
    "How is it that dreams are\nsymbolic?_",
    "That is to say, from where does this capacity for symbolic\nrepresentation come, of which we, in our conscious daily life, can\ndiscover apparently no traces?",
    "Let us examine this more closely.",
    "Can we really discover nothing\nsymbolic in our every-day thought?",
    "Let us follow our trains of thought;\nlet us take an example.",
    "We think of the war of 1870 and 1871.",
    "We think\nabout a series of bloody battles, the siege of Strassburg, Belfort,\nParis, the Treaty of Peace, the foundation of the German Empire, and so\non.",
    "How have we been thinking?",
    "We start with an idea, or super-idea, as\nit is also called, and without thinking of it, but each time merely\nguided by a feeling of direction, we think about individual\nreminiscences of the war.",
    "In this we can find nothing symbolic, and our\nwhole conscious thinking proceeds according to this type.[13]",
    "If we observe our thinking very narrowly, and follow an intensive train\nof thought, as, for example, the solution of a difficult problem, then\nsuddenly we notice that we are thinking in words, that in wholly\nintensive thinking we begin to speak to ourselves, or that we\noccasionally write down the problem, or make a drawing of it so as to be\nabsolutely clear.",
    "It must certainly have happened to any one who has\nlived for some time in a foreign country, that after a certain period he\nhas begun to think in the language of the country.",
    "A very intensive\ntrain of thinking works itself out more or less in _word form_; that is,\nif one wants to express it, to teach it, or to convince any one of it.\n",
    "Evidently it directs itself wholly to the outside world.",
    "To this extent,\nthis directed or logical thinking is a reality thinking,[14] having a\nreal existence for us; that is to say, a thinking which adjusts itself\nto actual conditions,[15] where we, expressed in other words, imitate\nthe succession of objectively real things, so that the images in our\nmind follow after each other in the same strictly causal succession as\nthe historical events outside of our mind.[16]",
    "We call this thinking, thinking with directed attention.",
    "It has, in\naddition, the peculiarity that one is tired by it, and that, on this\naccount, it is set into action only for a time.",
    "Our whole vital\naccomplishment, which is so expensive, is adaptation to environment; a\npart of it is the directed thinking, which, biologically expressed, is\nnothing but a process of psychic assimilation, which, as in every vital\naccomplishment, leaves behind a corresponding exhaustion.",
    "The material with which we think is _language and speech concept_, a\nthing which has been used from time immemorial as something external, a\nbridge for thought, and which has a single purpose—that of\ncommunication.",
    "As long as we think directedly, we think for others and\nspeak to others.[17]",
    "Speech is originally a system of emotional and imitative sounds—sounds\nwhich express terror, fear, anger, love; and sounds which imitate the\nnoises of the elements, the rushing and gurgling of water, the rolling\nof thunder, the tumults of the winds, the tones of the animal world, and\nso on; and, finally, those which represent a combination of the sounds\nof perception and of affective reaction.[18]",
    "Likewise in the more or\nless modern languages, large quantities of onomatopoetic relics are\nretained; for example, sounds for the movement of water,—",
    "Rauschen, risseln, rûschen, rinnen, rennen, to rush, ruscello,\n  ruisseau, river, Rhein.",
    "Wasser, wissen, wissern, pissen, piscis, fisch.",
    "Thus language is originally and essentially nothing but a system of\nsigns or symbols, which denote real occurrences, or their echo in the\nhuman soul.",
    "Therefore one must decidedly agree with Anatole France,[19] when he\nsays,",
    "“What is thought, and how do we think?",
    "We think with words; that alone\n  is sensual and brings us back to nature.",
    "Think of it!",
    "The\n  metaphysician has only the perfected cry of monkeys and dogs with\n  which to construct the system of the world.",
    "That which he calls\n  profound speculation and transcendent method is to put end to end in\n  an arbitrary order the natural sounds which cry out hunger, fear, and\n  love in the primitive forests, and to which were attached little by\n  little the meanings which one believed to be abstract, when they were\n  only crude.",
    "“Do not fear that the succession of small cries, feeble and stifled,\n  which compose a book of philosophy, will teach us so much regarding\n  the universe, that we can live in it no longer.”",
    "Thus is our directed thinking, and even if we were the loneliest and\nfurthest removed from our fellows, this thinking is nothing but the\nfirst notes of a long-drawn-out call to our companions that water had\nbeen found, that we had killed the bear, that a storm was approaching,\nor that wolves were prowling around the camp.",
    "A striking paradox of\nAbélard’s which expresses in a very intuitive way the whole human\nlimitation of our complicated thinking process, reads,—“_Sermo generatur\nab intellectu et generat intellectum_.”[20]",
    "Any system of philosophy, no matter how abstract, represents in means\nand purpose nothing more than an extremely cleverly developed\ncombination of original nature sounds.[21]",
    "Hence arises the desire of a\nSchopenhauer or a Nietzsche for recognition and understanding, and the\ndespair and bitterness of their loneliness.",
    "One might expect, perhaps,\nthat a man full of genius could pasture in the greatness of his own\nthoughts, and renounce the cheap approbation of the crowd which he\ndespises; yet he succumbs to the more powerful impulse of the herd\ninstinct.",
    "His searching and his finding, his call, belong to the herd.",
    "When I said just now that directed thinking is properly a thinking with\nwords, and quoted that clever testimony of Anatole France as drastic\nproof of it, a misunderstanding might easily arise, namely, that\ndirected thinking is really only “word.”",
    "That certainly would go too\nfar.",
    "Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider sense than\nthat of speech, which is in itself only the expression of the formulated\nthought which is capable of being communicated in the widest sense.\n",
    "Otherwise, the deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity\nfor thinking, which is not the case in reality.",
    "Without any knowledge of\nthe spoken word, he has his “language.”",
    "This language, considered from\nthe standpoint of history, or in other words, directed thinking, is here\na descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance, Wundt[22]\nexpresses it.",
    "“A further important result of that co-operation of sound and sign\n  interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually lose\n  altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and turn into\n  signs for general ideas and for the expression of the apperceptive\n  functions of relation and comparison and their products.",
    "In this\n  manner abstract thought develops, which, because it would not be\n  possible without the change of meaning lying at the root of it, is\n  indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical reciprocal\n  action out of which the development of language takes place.”",
    "Jodl[23] denies the identity of language and thought, because, for one\nreason, one and the same psychic fact might be expressed in different\nlanguages in different ways.",
    "From that he draws the conclusion that a\n“super-language thinking” exists.",
    "Certainly there is such a thing,\nwhether with Erdmann one considers it “hypologisch,” or with Jodl as\n“super-language.”",
    "Only this is not logical thinking.",
    "My conception of it\nagrees with the noteworthy contribution made by Baldwin, which I will\nquote here word for word.[24]",
    "“The transmission from pre-judgmental to judgmental meaning is just\n  that from knowledge which has social confirmation to that which gets\n  along without it.",
    "The meanings utilized for judgment are those already\n  developed in their presuppositions and applications through the\n  confirmation of social intercourse.",
    "Thus, the personal judgment,\n  trained in the methods of social rendering, and disciplined by the\n  interaction of its social world, projects its content into that world\n  again.",
    "In other words, the platform for all movement into the\n  assertion of individual judgment—the level from which new experience\n  is utilized—is already and always socialized; and it is just this\n  movement that we find reflected in the actual results as the sense of\n  the ‘appropriateness’ or synomic character of the meaning rendered.",
    "“Now the development of thought, as we are to see in more detail, is\n  by a method essentially of trial and error, of experimentation, of the\n  use of meanings as worth more than they are as yet recognized to be\n  worth.",
    "The individual must use his own thoughts, his established\n  knowledges, his grounded judgments, for the embodiment of his new\n  inventive constructions.",
    "He erects his thought as we say\n  ‘schematically’—in logic terms, ‘problematically,’ conditionally,\n  disjunctively; projecting into the world an opinion still peculiar to\n  himself, as if it were true.",
    "_",
    "Thus all discovery proceeds.",
    "_",
    "But this\n  is, from the linguistic point of view, still to use the current\n  language, still to work by meanings already embodied in social and\n  conventional usage.",
    "“Language grows, therefore, just as thought does, by never losing its\n  synomic or dual reference; its meaning is both personal and social.",
    "“It is the register of tradition, the record of racial conquest, the\n  deposit of all the gains made by the genius of individuals....",
    "The\n  social copy-system, thus established, reflects the judgmental\n  processes of the race, and in turn becomes the training school of the\n  judgment of new generations.",
    "“Most of the training of the self, whereby the vagaries of personal\n  reaction to fact and image are reduced to the basis of sound judgment,\n  comes through the use of speech.",
    "When the child speaks, he lays before\n  the world his suggestion for a general or common meaning.",
    "The\n  reception he gets confirms or refutes him.",
    "In either case he is\n  instructed.",
    "His next venture is now from a platform of knowledge on\n  which the newer item is more nearly convertible into the common coin\n  of effective intercourse.",
    "The point to notice here is not so much the\n  exact mechanism of the exchange—secondary conversion—by which this\n  gain is made, as the training in judgment that the constant use of it\n  affords.",
    "In each case, effective judgment is the common judgment.",
    "“Here the object is to point out that it is secured by the development\n  of a function _whose rise is directly ad hoc_, directly for the social\n  experimentation by which growth in personal competence is advanced as\n  well—_the function of speech_.",
    "“In language, therefore, to sum up the foregoing, we have the\n  tangible—the actual—the historical—instrument of the development and\n  conservation of psychic meaning.",
    "It is the material evidence and proof\n  of the _concurrence of social and personal judgment_.",
    "In it synomic\n  meaning, judged as ‘appropriate,’ becomes ‘social’ meaning, held as\n  socially generalized and acknowledged.”",
    "These arguments of Baldwin abundantly emphasize the wide-reaching\nlimitations of thinking caused by language.[25]",
    "These limitations are of\nthe greatest significance, both subjectively and objectively; at least\ntheir meaning is great enough to force one to ask one’s self if, after\nall, in regard to independence of thought, Franz Mauthner, thoroughly\nsceptical, is not really correct in his view that thinking is speech and\nnothing more.",
    "Baldwin expresses himself more cautiously and reservedly;\nnevertheless, his inner meaning is plainly in favor of the primacy of\nspeech (naturally not in the sense of the spoken word); the directed\nthinking, or as we might perhaps call it, the thinking in internal\nspeech, is the manifest instrument of culture, and we do not go astray\nwhen we say that the powerful work of education which the centuries have\ngiven to directed thinking has produced, just through the peculiar\ndevelopment of thinking from the individual subjective into the social\nobjective, a practical application of the human mind to which we owe\nmodern empiricism and technic, and which occurs for absolutely the first\ntime in the history of the world.",
    "Inquisitive minds have often tormented\nthemselves with the question why the undoubtedly extraordinary knowledge\nof mathematics and principles and material facts united with the\nunexampled art of the human hand in antiquity never arrived at the point\nof developing those known technical statements of fact, for instance,\nthe principles of simple machines, beyond the realm of the amusing and\ncurious to a real technic in the modern sense.",
    "There is necessarily only\none answer to this; the ancients almost entirely, with the exception of\na few extraordinary minds, lacked the capacity to allow their interest\nto follow the transformations of inanimate matter to the extent\nnecessary for them to be able to reproduce the process of nature,\ncreatively and through their own art, by means of which alone they could\nhave succeeded in putting themselves in possession of the force of\nnature.",
    "That which they lacked was training in directed thinking, or, to\nexpress it psychoanalytically, the ancients did not succeed in tearing\nloose the libido which might be sublimated, from the other natural\nrelations, and did not turn voluntarily to anthropomorphism.",
    "The secret\nof the development of culture lies in the _mobility of the libido_, and\nin its capacity for transference.",
    "It is, therefore, to be assumed that\nthe directed thinking of our time is a more or less modern acquisition,\nwhich was lacking in earlier times.",
    "But with that we come to a further question, viz., what happens if we do\nnot think directedly?",
    "Then our thinking lacks the major idea, and the\nfeeling of direction which emanates from that.[26] We no longer compel\nour thoughts along a definite track, but let them float, sink and mount\naccording to their own gravity.",
    "According to Kulpe[27] thinking is a\nkind of inner will action, the absence of which necessarily leads to an\nautomatic play of ideas.",
    "James understands the non-directed thinking, or\n“merely associative” thinking, as the ordinary one.",
    "He expresses himself\nabout that in the following manner:",
    "“Our thought consists for the great part of a series of images, one of\n  which produces the other; _a sort of passive dream-state of which the\n  higher animals are also capable_.",
    "This sort of thinking leads,\n  nevertheless, to reasonable conclusions of a practical as well as of a\n  theoretical nature.",
    "“As a rule, the links of this sort of irresponsible thinking, which\n  are accidentally bound together, are empirically concrete things, not\n  abstractions.”",
    "We can, in the following manner, complete these definitions of William\nJames.",
    "This sort of thinking does not tire us; it quickly leads us away\nfrom reality into phantasies of the past and future.",
    "Here, thinking in\nthe form of speech ceases, image crowds upon image, feeling upon\nfeeling; more and more clearly one sees a tendency which creates and\nmakes believe, not as it truly is, but as one indeed might wish it to\nbe.[28]",
    "The material of these thoughts which turns away from reality,\ncan naturally be only the past with its thousand memory pictures.",
    "The\ncustomary speech calls this kind of thinking “dreaming.”",
    "Whoever attentively observes himself will find the general custom of\nspeech very striking, for almost every day we can see for ourselves how,\nwhen falling asleep, phantasies are woven into our dreams, so that\nbetween the dreams of day and night there is not so great a difference.\n",
    "Thus we have two forms of thinking—_directed thinking_ and _dream or\nphantasy thinking_.",
    "The first, working for communication with speech\nelements, is troublesome and exhausting; the latter, on the contrary,\ngoes on without trouble, working spontaneously, so to speak, with\nreminiscences.",
    "The first creates innovations, adaptations, imitates\nreality and seeks to act upon it.",
    "The latter, on the contrary, turns\naway from reality, sets free subjective wishes, and is, in regard to\nadaptation, wholly unproductive.[29]",
    "Let us leave aside the query as to why we possess these two different\nways of thinking, and turn back to the second proposition, namely, how\ncomes it that we have two different ways of thinking?",
    "I have intimated\nabove that history shows us that directed thinking was not always as\ndeveloped as it is at present.",
    "In this age the most beautiful expression\nof directed thinking is science, and the technic fostered by it.",
    "Both\nthings are indebted for their existence simply to an energetic education\nin directed thinking.",
    "At the time, however, when a few forerunners of\nthe present culture, like the poet Petrarch, first began to appreciate\nNature understandingly[30] there was already in existence an equivalent\nfor our science, to wit, scholasticism.[31] This took its objects from\nthe phantasies of the past, and it gave to the mind a dialectic training\nin directed thinking.",
    "The only success which beckoned the thinker was\nrhetorical victory in disputation, and not a visible transformation of\nreality.",
    "The subjects of thinking were often astonishingly phantastical; for\nexample, questions were discussed, such as how many angels could have a\nplace on the point of a needle?",
    "Whether Christ could have done his work\nof redemption equally well if he had come into the world as a pea?",
    "The\npossibility of such problems, to which belong the metaphysical problems\nin general, viz., to be able to know the unknowable, shows us of what\npeculiar kind that mind must have been which created such things which\nto us are the height of absurdity.",
    "Nietzsche had guessed, however, at\nthe biological background of this phenomenon when he spoke of the\n“beautiful tension” of the Germanic mind which the Middle Ages created.\n",
    "Taken historically, scholasticism, in the spirit of which persons of\ntowering intellectual powers, such as Thomas of Aquinas, Duns Scotus,\nAbélard, William of Occam and others, have labored, is the mother of the\nmodern scientific attitude, and a later time will see clearly how and in\nwhat scholasticism still furnishes living undercurrents to the science\nof to-day.",
    "Its whole nature lies in dialectic gymnastics which have\nraised the symbol of speech, the word, to an almost absolute meaning, so\nthat it finally attained to that substantiality which expiring antiquity\ncould lend to its _logos_ only temporarily, through attributes of\nmystical valuation.",
    "The great work of scholasticism, however, appears to\nbe the foundation of firmly knitted intellectual sublimation, the\n_conditio sine qua non_ of the modern scientific and technical spirit.",
    "Should we go further back into history, we shall find that which to-day\nwe call science, dissolved into an indistinct cloud.",
    "The modern\nculture-creating mind is incessantly occupied in stripping off all\nsubjectivity from experience, and in finding those formulas which bring\nNature and her forces to the best and most fitting expression.",
    "It would\nbe an absurd and entirely unjustified self-glorification if we were to\nassume that we are more energetic or more intelligent than the\nancients—our materials for knowledge have increased, but not our\nintellectual capacity.",
    "For this reason, we become immediately as\nobstinate and insusceptible in regard to new ideas as people in the\ndarkest times of antiquity.",
    "Our knowledge has increased but not our\nwisdom.",
    "The main point of our interest is displaced wholly into material\nreality; antiquity preferred a mode of thought which was more closely\nrelated to a phantastic type.",
    "Except for a sensitive perspicuity towards\nworks of art, not attained since then, we seek in vain in antiquity for\nthat precise and concrete manner of thinking characteristic of modern\nscience.",
    "We see the antique spirit create not science but mythology.\n",
    "Unfortunately, we acquire in school only a very paltry conception of the\nrichness and immense power of life of Grecian mythology.",
    "Therefore, at first glance, it does not seem possible for us to assume\nthat that energy and interest which to-day we put into science and\ntechnic, the man of antiquity gave in great part to his mythology.",
    "That,\nnevertheless, gives the explanation for the bewildering changes, the\nkaleidoscopic transformations and new syncretistic groupings, and the\ncontinued rejuvenation of the myths in the Grecian sphere of culture.\n",
    "Here, we move in a world of phantasies, which, little concerned with the\nouter course of things, flows from an inner source, and, constantly\nchanging, creates now plastic, now shadowy shapes.",
    "This phantastical\nactivity of the ancient mind created artistically _par excellence_.",
    "The\nobject of the interest does not seem to have been to grasp hold of the\n“how” of the real world as objectively and exactly as possibly, but to\næsthetically adapt subjective phantasies and expectations.",
    "There was\nvery little place among ancient people for the coldness and disillusion\nwhich Giordano Bruno’s thoughts on eternity and Kepler’s discoveries\nbrought to modern humanity.",
    "The naïve man of antiquity saw in the sun\nthe great Father of the heaven and the earth, and in the moon the\nfruitful good Mother.",
    "Everything had its demons; they animated equally a\nhuman being and his brother, the animal.",
    "Everything was considered\naccording to its anthropomorphic or theriomorphic attributes, as human\nbeing or animal.",
    "Even the disc of the sun was given wings or four feet,\nin order to illustrate its movement.",
    "Thus arose an idea of the universe\nwhich was not only very far from reality, but was one which corresponded\nwholly to subjective phantasies.",
    "We know, from our own experience, this state of mind.",
    "It is an infantile\nstage.",
    "To a child the moon is a man or a face or a shepherd of the\nstars.",
    "The clouds in the sky seem like little sheep; the dolls drink,\neat and sleep; the child places a letter at the window for the\nChrist-child; he calls to the stork to bring him a little brother or\nsister; the cow is the wife of the horse, and the dog the husband of the\ncat.",
    "We know, too, that lower races, like the negroes, look upon the\nlocomotive as an animal, and call the drawers of the table the child of\nthe table.",
    "As we learn through Freud, the dream shows a similar type.",
    "Since the\ndream is unconcerned with the real condition of things, it brings the\nmost heterogeneous matter together, and a world of impossibilities takes\nthe place of realities.",
    "Freud finds progression characteristic of\nthinking when awake; that is to say, the advancement of the thought\nexcitation from the system of the inner or outer perception through the\n“endopsychic” work of association, conscious and unconscious, to the\nmotor end; that is to say, towards innervation.",
    "In the dream he finds\nthe reverse, namely, regression of the thought excitation from the\npreconscious or unconscious to the system of perception, by the means of\nwhich the dream receives its ordinary impression of sensuous\ndistinctness, which can rise to an almost hallucinating clearness.",
    "The\ndream thinking moves in a retrograde manner towards the raw material of\nmemory.",
    "“The structure of the dream thoughts is dissolved during the\nprogress of regression into its raw material.”",
    "The reanimation of the\noriginal perception is, however, only one side of regression.",
    "The other\nside is regression to the infantile memory material, which might also be\nunderstood as regression to the original perception, but which deserves\nespecial mention on account of its independent importance.",
    "This\nregression might, indeed, be considered as “historical.”",
    "The dream,\naccording to this conception, might also be described as _the substitute\nof the infantile scene, changed through transference into the recent\nscene_.",
    "The infantile scene cannot carry through its revival; it must be\nsatisfied with its return as a dream.",
    "From this conception of the\nhistorical side of regression, it follows consequently that the modes of\nconclusion of the dream, in so far as one may speak of them, must show\nat the same time an analogous and infantile character.",
    "This is truly the\ncase, as experience has abundantly shown, so that to-day every one who\nis familiar with the subject of dream analysis confirms Freud’s\nproposition that _dreams are a piece of the conquered life of the\nchildish soul_.",
    "Inasmuch as the childish psychic life is undeniably of\nan archaic type, this characteristic belongs to the dream in quite an\nunusual degree.",
    "Freud calls our attention to this especially.",
    "“The dream, which fulfils its wishes by a short, regressive path,\n  affords us only an example of the primary method of working of the\n  psychic apparatus, which has been abandoned by us as unsuitable.",
    "That\n  which once ruled in the waking state, when the psychical life was\n  still young and impotent, appears to be banished to the dream life, in\n  somewhat the same way as the bow and arrow, those discarded, primitive\n  weapons of adult humanity, have been relegated to the nursery.",
    "”[32]",
    "All this experience suggests to us that we draw a parallel between the\nphantastical, mythological thinking of antiquity and the similar\nthinking of children, between the lower human races and dreams.[33]",
    "This\ntrain of thought is not a strange one for us, but quite familiar through\nour knowledge of comparative anatomy and the history of development,\nwhich show us how the structure and function of the human body are the\nresults of a series of embryonic changes which correspond to similar\nchanges in the history of the race.",
    "Therefore, the supposition is\njustified that ontogenesis corresponds in psychology to phylogenesis.\n",
    "Consequently, it would be true, as well, that the state of infantile\nthinking in the child’s psychic life, as well as in dreams, is nothing\nbut a re-echo of the prehistoric and the ancient.[34]",
    "In regard to this, Nietzsche takes a very broad and remarkable\nstandpoint.[35]",
    "“In our sleep and in our dreams we pass through the whole thought of\n  earlier humanity.",
    "I mean, in the same way that man reasons in his\n  dreams, he reasoned when in the waking state many thousands of years.\n  ",
    "The first _causa_ which occurred to his mind in reference to anything\n  that needed explanation, satisfied him and passed for truth.",
    "In the\n  dream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within\n  us, for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty\n  developed, and which is still developing in every individual.",
    "The\n  dream carries us back into earlier states of human culture, and\n  affords us a means of understanding it better.",
    "The dream thought is so\n  easy to us now, because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the\n  interminable stages of evolution during which this phantastic and\n  facile form of theorizing has prevailed.",
    "To a certain extent the dream\n  is a restorative for the brain, which during the day is called upon to\n  meet the severe demands for trained thought, made by the conditions of\n  a higher civilization.",
    "“From these facts, we can understand how lately more acute logical\n  thinking, the taking seriously of cause and effect, has been\n  developed; when our functions of reason and intelligence still reach\n  back involuntarily to those primitive forms of conclusion, and we live\n  about half our lives in this condition.”",
    "We have already seen that Freud, independently of Nietzsche, has reached\na similar standpoint from the basis of dream analysis.",
    "The step from\nthis established proposition to the perception of the myths as familiar\ndream images is no longer a great one.",
    "Freud has formulated this\nconclusion himself.[36]",
    "“The investigation of this folk-psychologic formation, myths, etc., is\n  by no means finished at present.",
    "To take an example of this, however,\n  it is probable that the myths correspond to the distorted residue of\n  wish phantasies of whole nations, the secularized dreams of young\n  humanity.”",
    "Rank[37] understands the myths in a similar manner, as a mass dream of\nthe people.[38] Riklin[39] has insisted rightly upon the dream mechanism\nof the fables, and Abraham[40] has done the same for the myths.",
    "He says:",
    "“The myth is a fragment of the infantile soul-life of the people.”",
    "and",
    "“Thus the myth is a _sustained, still remaining_ fragment from the\n  infantile soul-life of the people, and the dream is the myth of the\n  individual.”",
    "An unprejudiced reading of the above-mentioned authors will certainly\nallay all doubts concerning the intimate connection between dream\npsychology and myth psychology.",
    "The conclusion results almost from\nitself, that the age which created the myths thought childishly—that is\nto say, phantastically, as in our age is still done, to a very great\nextent (associatively or analogically) in dreams.",
    "The beginnings of myth\nformations (in the child), the taking of phantasies for realities, which\nis partly in accord with the historical, may easily be discovered among\nchildren.",
    "One might raise the objection that the mythological inclinations of\nchildren are implanted by education.",
    "The objection is futile.",
    "Has\nhumanity at all ever broken loose from the myths?",
    "Every man has eyes and\nall his senses to perceive that the world is dead, cold and unending,\nand he has never yet seen a God, nor brought to light the existence of\nsuch from empirical necessity.",
    "On the contrary, there was need of a\nphantastic, indestructible optimism, and one far removed from all sense\nof reality, in order, for example, to discover in the shameful death of\nChrist really the highest salvation and the redemption of the world.\n",
    "Thus one can indeed withhold from a child the substance of earlier myths\nbut not take from him the need for mythology.",
    "One can say, that should\nit happen that all traditions in the world were cut off with a single\nblow, then with the succeeding generation, the whole mythology and\nhistory of religion would start over again.",
    "Only a few individuals\nsucceed in throwing off mythology in a time of a certain intellectual\nsupremacy—the mass never frees itself.",
    "Explanations are of no avail;\nthey merely destroy a transitory form of manifestation, but not the\ncreating impulse.",
    "Let us again take up our earlier train of thought.",
    "We spoke of the ontogenetic re-echo of the phylogenetic psychology among\nchildren, we saw that phantastic thinking is a characteristic of\nantiquity, of the child, and of the lower races; but now we know also\nthat our modern and adult man is given over in large part to this same\nphantastic thinking, which enters as soon as the directed thinking\nceases.",
    "A lessening of the interest, a slight fatigue, is sufficient to\nput an end to the directed thinking, the exact psychological adaptation\nto the real world, and to replace it with phantasies.",
    "We digress from\nthe theme and give way to our own trains of thought; if the slackening\nof the attention increases, then we lose by degrees the consciousness of\nthe present, and the phantasy enters into possession of the field.",
    "Here the important question obtrudes itself: How are phantasies created?\n",
    "From the poets we learn much about it; from science we learn little.",
    "The\npsychoanalytic method, presented to science by Freud, shed light upon\nthis for the first time.",
    "It showed us that there are typical cycles.",
    "The\nstutterer imagines he is a great orator.",
    "The truth of this, Demosthenes,\nthanks to his energy, has proven.",
    "The poor man imagines himself to be a\nmillionaire, the child an adult.",
    "The conquered fight out victorious\nbattles with the conquerer; the unfit torments or delights himself with\nambitious plans.",
    "We imagine that which we lack.",
    "The interesting question\nof the “why” of all this we must here leave unanswered, while we return\nto the historic problem: From what source do the phantasies draw their\nmaterials?[41]",
    "We chose, as an example, a typical phantasy of puberty.",
    "A\nchild in that stage before whom the whole frightening uncertainty of the\nfuture fate opens, puts back the uncertainty into the past, through his\nphantasy, and says, “If only I were not the child of my ordinary\nparents, but the child of a rich and fashionable count, and had been\nmerely passed over to my parents, then some day a golden coach would\ncome, and the count would take his child back with him to his wonderful\ncastle,” and so it goes on, as in Grimm’s Fairy Tales which the mother\ntells to her children.[42] With a normal child, it stops with the\nfugitive, quickly-passing idea which is soon covered over and forgotten.\n",
    "However, at one time, and that was in the ancient world of culture, the\nphantasy was an openly acknowledged institution.",
    "The heroes,—I recall\nRomulus and Remus, Semiramis, Moses and many others,—have been separated\nfrom their real parents.[43] Others are directly sons of gods, and the\nnoble races derive their family trees from heroes and gods.",
    "As one sees\nby this example, the phantasy of modern humanity is nothing but a\nre-echo of an old-folk-belief, which was very widespread originally.[44]\nThe ambitious phantasy chooses, among others, a form which is classic,\nand which once had a true meaning.",
    "The same thing holds good in regard\nto the sexual phantasy.",
    "In the preamble we have spoken of dreams of\nsexual assault: the robber who breaks into the house and commits a\ndangerous act.",
    "That, too, is a mythological theme, and in the\nprehistoric era was certainly a reality too.[45]",
    "Wholly apart from the\nfact that the capture of women was something general in the lawless\nprehistoric times, it was also a subject of mythology in cultivated\nepochs.",
    "I recall the capture of Proserpina, Deianira, Europa, the Sabine\nwomen, etc.",
    "We must not forget that, even to-day, marriage customs exist\nin various regions which recall the ancient custom of marriage by\ncapture.",
    "The symbolism of the instrument of coitus was an inexhaustible material\nfor ancient phantasy.",
    "It furnished a widespread cult that was designated\nphallic, the object of reverence of which was the phallus.",
    "The companion\nof Dionysus was Phales, a personification of the phallus proceeding from\nthe phallic Herme of Dionysus.",
    "The phallic symbols were countless.",
    "Among\nthe Sabines, the custom existed for the bridegroom to part the bride’s\nhair with a lance.",
    "The bird, the fish and the snake were phallic\nsymbols.",
    "In addition, there existed in enormous quantities theriomorphic\nrepresentations of the sexual instinct, in connection with which the\nbull, the he-goat, the ram, the boar and the ass were frequently used.\n",
    "An undercurrent to this choice of symbol was furnished by the sodomitic\ninclination of humanity.",
    "When in the dream phantasy of modern man, the\nfeared man is replaced by an animal, there is recurring in the\nontogenetic re-echo the same thing which was openly represented by the\nancients countless times.",
    "There were he-goats which pursued nymphs,\nsatyrs with she-goats; in still older times in Egypt there even existed\na shrine of a goat god, which the Greeks called Pan, where the\nHierodules prostituted themselves with goats.[46]",
    "It is well known that\nthis worship has not died out, but continues to live as a special custom\nin South Italy and Greece.[47]",
    "To-day we feel for such a thing nothing but the deepest abhorrence, and\nnever would admit it still slumbered in our souls.",
    "Nevertheless, just as\ntruly as the idea of the sexual assault is there, so are these things\nthere too; which we should contemplate still more closely,—not through\nmoral eye-glasses, with horror, but with interest as a natural science,\nsince these things are venerable relics of past culture periods.",
    "We\nhave, even to-day, a clause in our penal code against sodomy.",
    "But that\nwhich was once so strong as to give rise to a worship among a highly\ndeveloped people has probably not wholly disappeared from the human soul\nduring the course of a few generations.",
    "We may not forget that since the\nsymposium of Plato, in which homo-sexuality faces us on the same level\nwith the so-called “normal sexuality,” only eighty generations have\npassed.",
    "And what are eighty generations?",
    "They shrink to an imperceptible\nperiod of time when compared with the space of time which separates us\nfrom the homo-Neandertalensis or Heidelbergensis.",
    "I might call to mind,\nin this connection, some choice thoughts of the great historian\nGuglielmo Ferrero:[48]",
    "“It is a very common belief that the further man is separated from the\n  present by time, the more does he differ from us in his thoughts and\n  feelings; that the psychology of humanity changes from century to\n  century, like fashions of literature.",
    "Therefore, no sooner do we find\n  in past history an institution, a custom, a law or a belief a little\n  different from those with which we are familiar, than we immediately\n  search for some complex meanings, which frequently resolve themselves\n  into phrases of doubtful significance.",
    "“Indeed, man does not change so quickly; his psychology at bottom\n  remains the same, and even if his culture varies much from one epoch\n  to another, it does not change the functioning of his mind.",
    "The\n  fundamental laws of the mind remain the same, at least during the\n  short historical period of which we have knowledge, and all phenomena,\n  even the most strange, must be capable of explanation by those common\n  laws of the mind which we can recognize in ourselves.”",
    "The psychologist should accept this viewpoint without reservation as\npeculiarly applicable to himself.",
    "To-day, indeed, in our civilization\nthe phallic processions, the Dionysian mysteries of classical Athens,\nthe barefaced Phallic emblems, have disappeared from our coins, houses,\ntemples and streets; so also have the theriomorphic representations of\nthe Deity been reduced to small remnants, like the Dove of the Holy\nGhost, the Lamb of God and the Cock of Peter adorning our church towers.\n",
    "In the same way, the capture and violation of women have shrunken away\nto crimes.",
    "Yet all of this does not affect the fact that we, in\nchildhood, go through a period in which the impulses toward these\narchaic inclinations appear again and again, and that through all our\nlife we possess, side by side with the newly recruited, directed and\nadapted thought, a phantastic thought which corresponds to the thought\nof the centuries of antiquity and barbarism.",
    "Just as our bodies still\nkeep the reminders of old functions and conditions in many old-fashioned\norgans, so our minds, too, which apparently have outgrown those archaic\ntendencies, nevertheless bear the marks of the evolution passed through,\nand the very ancient re-echoes, at least dreamily, in phantasies.",
    "The symbolism which Freud has discovered, is revealed as an expression\nof a thinking and of an impulse limited to the dream, to wrong conduct,\nand to derangements of the mind, which form of thinking and impulse at\none time ruled as the mightiest influence in past culture epochs.",
    "The question of _whence_ comes the inclination and ability which enables\nthe mind to express itself symbolically, brings us to the distinction\nbetween the two kinds of thinking—the directed and adapted on one hand,\nand the subjective, fed by our own egotistic wishes, on the other.",
    "The\nlatter form of thinking, presupposing that it were not constantly\ncorrected by the adapted thinking, must necessarily produce an\noverwhelmingly subjectively distorted idea of the world.",
    "We regard this\nstate of mind as infantile.",
    "It lies in our individual past, and in the\npast of mankind.",
    "With this we affirm the important fact that man in his phantastic\nthinking has kept a condensation of the psychic history of his\ndevelopment.",
    "An extraordinarily important task, which even to-day is\nhardly possible, is to give a systematic description of phantastic\nthinking.",
    "One may, at the most, sketch it.",
    "While directed thinking is a\nphenomenon conscious throughout,[49] the same cannot be asserted of\nphantastic thinking.",
    "Doubtless, a great part of it still falls entirely\nin the realm of the conscious, but, at least, just as much goes along in\nhalf shadows, and generally an undetermined amount in the unconscious;\nand this can, therefore, be disclosed only indirectly.[50] By means of\nphantastic thinking, directed thinking is connected with the oldest\nfoundations of the human mind, which have been for a long time beneath\nthe threshold of the consciousness.",
    "The products of this phantastic\nthinking arising directly from the consciousness are, first, waking\ndreams, or day-dreams, to which Freud, Flournoy, Pick and others have\ngiven special attention; then the dreams which offer to the\nconsciousness, at first, a mysterious exterior, and win meaning only\nthrough the indirectly inferred unconscious contents.",
    "Lastly, there is a\nso-called wholly unconscious phantasy system in the split-off complex,\nwhich exhibits a pronounced tendency towards the production of a\ndissociated personality.[51]",
    "Our foregoing explanations show wherein the products arising from the\nunconscious are related to the mythical.",
    "From all these signs it may be\nconcluded that the soul possesses in some degree historical strata, the\noldest stratum of which would correspond to the unconscious.",
    "The result\nof that must be that an introversion occurring in later life, according\nto the Freudian teaching, seizes upon regressive infantile reminiscences\ntaken from the individual past.",
    "That first points out the way; then,\nwith stronger introversion and regression (strong repressions,\nintroversion psychoses), there come to light pronounced traits of an\narchaic mental kind which, under certain circumstances, might go as far\nas the re-echo of a once manifest, archaic mental product.",
    "This problem deserves to be more thoroughly discussed.",
    "As a concrete\nexample, let us take the history of the pious Abbé Oegger which Anatole\nFrance has communicated to us.[52]",
    "This priest was a hypercritical man,\nand much given to phantasies, especially in regard to one question,\nviz., the fate of Judas; whether he was really damned, as the teaching\nof the church asserts, to everlasting punishment, or whether God had\npardoned him after all.",
    "Oegger sided with the intelligent point of view\nthat God, in his all-wisdom, had chosen Judas as an instrument, in order\nto bring about the highest point of the work of redemption by\nChrist.[53] This necessary instrument, without the help of which the\nhuman race would not have been a sharer in salvation, could not possibly\nbe damned by the all-good God.",
    "In order to put an end to his doubts,\nOegger went one night to the church, and made supplication for a sign\nthat Judas was saved.",
    "Then he felt a heavenly touch upon his shoulder.\n",
    "Following this, Oegger told the Archbishop of his resolution to go out\ninto the world to preach God’s unending mercy.",
    "Here we have a richly developed phantasy system before us.",
    "It is\nconcerned with the subtle and perpetually undecided question as to\nwhether the legendary figure of Judas is damned or not.",
    "The Judas legend\nis, in itself, mythical material, viz., the malicious betrayal of a\nhero.",
    "I recall Siegfried and Hagen, Balder and Loki.",
    "Siegfried and\nBalder were murdered by a faithless traitor from among their closest\nassociates.",
    "This myth is moving and tragic—it is not honorable battle\nwhich kills the noble, but evil treachery.",
    "It is, too, an occurrence\nwhich is historical over and over again.",
    "One thinks of Cæsar and Brutus.\n",
    "Since the myth of such a deed is very old, and still the subject of\nteaching and repetition, it is the expression of a psychological fact,\nthat envy does not allow humanity to sleep, and that all of us carry, in\na hidden recess of our heart, a deadly wish towards the hero.",
    "This rule\ncan be applied generally to mythical tradition.",
    "_",
    "It does not set forth\nany account of the old events, but rather acts in such a way that it\nalways reveals a thought common to humanity, and once more rejuvenated.",
    "_\n",
    "Thus, for example, the lives and deeds of the founders of old religions\nare the purest condensations of typical, contemporaneous myths, behind\nwhich the individual figure entirely disappears.[54]",
    "But why does our pious Abbé torment himself with the old Judas legend?\n",
    "He first went into the world to preach the gospel of mercy, and then,\nafter some time, he separated from the Catholic church and became a\nSwedenborgian.",
    "Now we understand his Judas phantasy.",
    "_",
    "He was the Judas_\nwho betrayed his Lord.",
    "Therefore, first of all, he had to make sure of\nthe divine mercy, in order to be Judas in peace.",
    "This case throws a light upon the mechanism of the phantasies in\ngeneral.",
    "The known, conscious phantasy may be of mythical or other\nmaterial; it is not to be taken seriously as such, for it has an\nindirect meaning.",
    "If we take it, however, as important per se, then the\nthing is not understandable, and makes one despair of the efficiency of\nthe mind.",
    "But we saw, in the case of Abbé Oegger, that his doubts and\nhis hopes did not turn upon the historical problem of Judas, but upon\nhis own personality, which wished to win a way to freedom for itself\nthrough the solution of the Judas problem.",
    "_",
    "The conscious phantasies tell us of mythical or other material of\nundeveloped or no longer recognized wish tendencies in the soul._",
    "As is\neasily to be understood, an innate tendency, an acknowledgment of which\none refuses to make, and which one treats as non-existent, can hardly\ncontain a thing that may be in accord with our conscious character.",
    "It\nconcerns the tendencies which are considered immoral, and as generally\nimpossible, and the strongest resentment is felt towards bringing them\ninto the consciousness.",
    "What would Oegger have said had he been told\nconfidentially that he was preparing himself for the Judas rôle?",
    "And\nwhat in ourselves do we consider immoral and non-existent, or which we\nat least wish were non-existent?",
    "It is that which in antiquity lay\nwidespread on the surface, viz., sexuality in all its various\nmanifestations.",
    "Therefore, we need not wonder in the least when we find\nthis at the base of most of our phantasies, even if the phantasies have\na different appearance.",
    "Because Oegger found the damnation of Judas\nincompatible with God’s goodness, he thought about the conflict in that\nway; that is the conscious sequence.",
    "Along with this is the unconscious\nsequence; because Oegger himself wished to be a Judas, he first made\nsure of the goodness of God.",
    "To Oegger, Judas was the symbol of his own\nunconscious tendency, and he made use of this symbol in order to be able\nto meditate over his unconscious wish.",
    "The direct coming into\nconsciousness of the Judas wish would have been too painful for him.\n",
    "_",
    "Thus, there must be typical myths which are really the instruments of a\nfolk-psychological complex treatment.",
    "_",
    "Jacob Burckhardt seems to have\nsuspected this when he once said that every Greek of the classical era\ncarried in himself a fragment of the Oedipus, just as every German\ncarries a fragment of Faust.[55]",
    "The problem which the simple story of the Abbé Oegger has brought\nclearly before us confronts us again when we prepare to examine\nphantasies which owe their existence this time to an exclusively\nunconscious work.",
    "We are indebted for the material which we will use in\nthe following chapters to the useful publication of an American woman,\nMiss Frank Miller, who has given to the world some poetical\nunconsciously formed phantasies under the title, “Quelque faits\nd’imagination créatrice subconsciente.",
    "”—_Vol.",
    "V., Archives de\nPsychologie, 1906._[56]",
    "CHAPTER II\n                         THE MILLER PHANTASIES",
    "We know, from much psychoanalytic experience, that whenever one recounts\nhis phantasies or his dreams, he deals not only with the most important\nand intimate of his problems, but with the one the most painful at that\nmoment.[57]",
    "Since in the case of Miss Miller we have to do with a complicated\nsystem, we must give our attention carefully to the particulars which I\nwill discuss, following as best I can Miss Miller’s presentation.",
    "In the first chapter, “Phénomènes de suggestion passagère ou\nd’autosuggestion instantanée,” Miss Miller gives a list of examples of\nher unusual suggestibility, which she herself considers as a symptom of\nher nervous temperament; for example, she is excessively fond of caviar,\nwhereas some of her relatives loathe it.",
    "However, as soon as any one\nexpresses his loathing, she herself feels momentarily the same loathing.\n",
    "I do not need to emphasize especially the fact that such examples are\nvery important in individual psychology; that caviar is a food for which\nnervous women frequently have an especial predilection, is a fact well\nknown to the psychoanalyst.",
    "Miss Miller has an extraordinary faculty for taking other people’s\nfeelings upon herself, and of identification; for example, she\nidentifies herself to such a degree in “Cyrano” with the wounded\nChristian de Neuvillette, that she feels in her own breast a truly\npiercing pain at that place where Christian received the deadly blow.",
    "From the viewpoint of analytic psychology, the theatre, aside from any\nesthetic value, may be considered as an institution for the treatment of\nthe mass complex.",
    "The enjoyment of the comedy, or of the dramatic plot\nending happily is produced by an unreserved identification of one’s own\ncomplexes with the play.",
    "The enjoyment of tragedy lies in the thrilling\nyet satisfactory feeling that something which might occur to one’s self\nis happening to another.",
    "The sympathy of our author with the dying\nChristian means that there is in her a complex awaiting a similar\nsolution, which whispers softly to her “hodie tibi, cras mihi,” and that\none may know exactly what is considered the effectual moment Miss Miller\nadds that she felt a pain in her breast, “Lorsque Sarah Bernhardt se\nprécipite sur lui pour étancher le sang de sa blessure.”",
    "Therefore the\neffectual moment is when the love between Christian and Roxane comes to\na sudden end.",
    "If we glance over the whole of Rostand’s play, we come upon certain\nmoments, the effect of which one cannot easily escape and which we will\nemphasize here because they have meaning for all that follows.",
    "Cyrano de\nBergerac, with the long ugly nose, on account of which he undertakes\ncountless duels, loves Roxane, who, for her part unaware of it, loves\nChristian, because of the beautiful verses which really originate from\nCyrano’s pen, but which apparently come from Christian.",
    "Cyrano is the\nmisunderstood one, whose passionate love and noble soul no one suspects;\nthe hero who sacrifices himself for others, and, dying, just in the\nevening of life, reads to her once more Christian’s last letter, the\nverses which he himself had composed.",
    "“Roxane, adieu, je vais mourir!\n           ",
    "C’est pour ce soir, je crois, ma bien-aimée!\n           ",
    "J’ai l’âme lourde encore d’amour inexprimé.\n           ",
    "Et je meurs!",

    "Cyrano, who under the hateful exterior of his body hid a soul so much\nmore beautiful, is a yearner and one misunderstood, and his last triumph\nis that he departs, at least, with a clean shield—“Sans un pli et sans\nune tache.”",
    "The identification of the author with the dying Christian,\nwho in himself is a figure but little impressive and sympathetic,\nexpresses clearly that a sudden end is destined for her love just as for\nChristian’s love.",
    "The tragic intermezzo with Christian, however, is\nplayed as we have seen upon a background of much wider significance,\nviz., the misunderstood love of Cyrano for Roxane.",
    "Therefore, the\nidentification with Christian has only the significance of a substitute\nmemory (“deckerinnerung”), and is really intended for Cyrano.",
    "That this\nis just what we might expect will be seen in the further course of our\nanalysis.",
    "Besides this story of identification with Christian, there follows as a\nfurther example an extraordinarily plastic memory of the sea, evoked by\nthe sight of a photograph of a steamboat on the high seas.",
    "(“Je sentis\nles pulsations des machines, le soulèvement des vagues, le balancement\ndu navire.”)",
    "We may mention here the supposition that there are connected with sea\njourneys particularly impressive and strong memories which penetrate\ndeeply into the soul and give an especially strong character to the\nsurface memories through unconscious harmony.",
    "To what extent the\nmemories assumed here agree with the above mentioned problem we shall\nsee in the following pages.",
    "This example, following at this time, is singular:",
    "Once, while in\nbathing, Miss Miller wound a towel around her hair, in order to protect\nit from a wetting.",
    "At the same moment she had the following strong\nimpression:",
    "“Il me sembla que j’étais sur un piédestal, une véritable statue\n  égyptienne, avec tous ses détails: membres raides, un pied en avant,\n  la main tenant des insignes,” and so on.",
    "Miss Miller identified herself, therefore, with an Egyptian statue, and\nnaturally the foundation for this was a subjective pretension.",
    "That is\nto say, “I am like an Egyptian statue, just as stiff, wooden, sublime\nand impassive,” qualities for which the Egyptian statue is proverbial.\n",
    "One does not make such an assertion to one’s self without an inner\ncompulsion, and the correct formula might just as well be, “as stiff,\nwooden, etc., as an Egyptian statue I might indeed be.”",
    "The sight of\none’s own unclothed body in a bath has undeniable effects for the\nphantasy, which can be set at rest by the above formula.[58]",
    "The example which follows this, emphasizes the author’s personal\ninfluence upon an artist:",
    "“J’ai réussi à lui faire rendre des paysages, comme ceux du lac Léman,\n  où il n’a jamais été, et il prétendait que je pouvais lui faire rendre\n  des choses qu’il n’avait jamais vues, et lui donner la sensation d’une\n  atmosphère ambiante qu’il n’avait jamais sentie; bref que je me\n  servais de lui comme lui-même se servait de son crayon, c’est à dire\n  comme d’un simple instrument.”",
    "This observation stands in abrupt contrast to the phantasy of the\nEgyptian statue.",
    "Miss Miller had here the unspoken need of emphasizing\nher almost magic effect upon another person.",
    "This could not have\nhappened, either, without an unconscious need, which is particularly\nfelt by one who does not often succeed in making an emotional impression\nupon a fellow being.",
    "With that, the list of examples which are to picture Miss Miller’s\nautosuggestibility and suggestive effect, is exhausted.",
    "In this respect,\nthe examples are neither especially striking nor interesting.",
    "From an\nanalytical viewpoint, on the contrary, they are much more important,\nsince they afford us a glance into the soul of the writer.",
    "Ferenczi[59]\nhas taught us in an excellent work what is to be thought about\nsuggestibility, that is to say, that these phenomena win new aspects in\nthe light of the Freudian libido theory, in so much as their effects\nbecome clear through “Libido-besetzungen.”",
    "This was already indicated\nabove in the discussion of the examples, and in the greatest detail\nregarding the identification with Christian.",
    "The identification becomes\neffective by its receiving an influx of energy from the strongly\naccentuated thought and emotional feeling underlying the Christian\nmotif.",
    "Just the reverse is the suggestive effect of the individual in an\nespecial capacity for concentrating interest (that is to say, libido)\nupon another person, by which the other is unconsciously compelled to\nreaction (the same or opposed).",
    "The majority of the examples concern\ncases where Miss Miller is put under the effects of suggestion; that is\nto say, when the libido has spontaneously gained possession of certain\nimpressions, and this is impossible if the libido is dammed up to an\nunusual degree by the lack of application to reality.",
    "Miss Miller’s\nobservations about suggestibility inform us, therefore, of the fact that\nthe author is pleased to tell us in her following phantasies something\nof the history of her love.",
    "CHAPTER III\n                          THE HYMN OF CREATION",
    "The second chapter in Miss Miller’s work is entitled, “Gloire à Dieu.\n",
    "Poème onirique.”",
    "When twenty years of age, Miss Miller took a long journey through\nEurope.",
    "We leave the description of it to her:",
    "“After a long and rough journey from New York to Stockholm, from there\n  to Petersburg and Odessa, I found it a true pleasure[60] to leave the\n  world of inhabited cities—and to enter the world of waves, sky and\n  silence—I stayed hours long on deck to dream, stretched out in a\n  reclining chair.",
    "The histories, legends and myths of the different\n  countries which I saw in the distance, came back to me indistinctly\n  blended together in a sort of luminous mist, in which things lost\n  their reality, while the dreams and thoughts alone took on somewhat\n  the appearance of reality.",
    "At first, I even avoided all company and\n  kept to myself, lost wholly in my dreams, where all that I knew of\n  great, beautiful and good came back into my consciousness with new\n  strength and new life.",
    "I also employed a great part of my time writing\n  to my distant friends, reading and sketching out short poems about the\n  regions visited.",
    "Some of these poems were of a very serious\n  character.”",
    "It may seem superfluous, perhaps, to enter intimately into all these\ndetails.",
    "If we recall, however, the remark made above,—that when people\nlet their unconscious speak, they always tell us the most important\nthings of their intimate selves—then even the smallest detail appears to\nhave meaning.",
    "Valuable personalities invariably tell us, through their\nunconscious, things that are generally valuable, so that patient\ninterest is rewarded.",
    "Miss Miller describes here a state of “introversion.”",
    "After the life of\nthe cities with their many impressions had been absorbing her interest\n(with that already discussed strength of suggestion which powerfully\nenforced the impression) she breathed freely upon the ocean, and after\nso many external impressions, became engrossed wholly in the internal\nwith intentional abstraction from the surroundings, so that things lost\ntheir reality and dreams became truth.",
    "We know from psychopathology that\ncertain mental disturbances[61] exist which are first manifested by the\nindividuals shutting themselves off slowly, more and more, from reality\nand sinking into their phantasies, during which process, in proportion\nas the reality loses its hold, the inner world gains in reality and\ndetermining power.[62]",
    "This process leads to a certain point (which\nvaries with the individual) when the patients suddenly become more or\nless conscious of their separation from reality.",
    "The event which then\nenters is the pathological excitation: that is to say, the patients\nbegin to turn towards the environment, with diseased views (to be sure)\nwhich, however, still represent the compensating, although unsuccessful,\nattempt at transference.[63] The methods of reaction are, naturally,\nvery different.",
    "I will not concern myself more closely about this here.",
    "This type appears to be generally a psychological rule which holds good\nfor all neuroses and, therefore, also for the normal in a much less\ndegree.",
    "We might, therefore, expect that Miss Miller, after this\nenergetic and persevering introversion, which had even encroached for a\ntime upon the feeling of reality, would succumb anew to an impression of\nthe real world and also to just as suggestive and energetic an influence\nas that of her dreams.",
    "Let us proceed with the narrative:",
    "“But as the journey drew to an end, the ship’s officers outdid\n  themselves in kindness (tout ce qu’il y a de plus empressé et de plus\n  aimable) and I passed many amusing hours teaching them English.",
    "On the\n  Sicilian coast, in the harbor of Catania, I wrote a sailor’s song\n  which was very similar to a song well known on the sea, (Brine, wine\n  and damsels fine).",
    "The Italians in general all sing very well, and one\n  of the officers who sang on deck during night watch, had made a great\n  impression upon me and had given me the idea of writing some words\n  adapted to his melody.",
    "Soon after that, I was very nearly obliged to\n  reverse the well-known saying, ‘Veder Napoli e poi morir,’—that is to\n  say, suddenly I became very ill, although not dangerously so.",
    "I\n  recovered to such an extent, however, that I could go on land to visit\n  the sights of the city in a carriage.",
    "This day tired me very much, and\n  since we had planned to see Pisa the following day, I went on board\n  early in the evening and soon lay down to sleep without thinking of\n  anything more serious than the beauty of the officers and the ugliness\n  of the Italian beggars.”",
    "One is somewhat disappointed at meeting here, instead of the expected\nimpression of reality, rather a small intermezzo, a flirtation.\n",
    "Nevertheless, one of the officers, the singer, had made a great\nimpression (il m’avait fait beaucoup d’impression).",
    "The remark at the\nclose of the description, “sans songer à rien de plus sérieux qu’à",
    "la\nbeauté des officiers,” and so on, diminishes the seriousness of the\nimpression, it is true.",
    "The assumption, however, that the impression\nopenly influenced the mood very much, is supported by the fact that a\npoem upon a subject of such an erotic character came forth immediately,\n“Brine, wine and damsels fine,” and in the singer’s honor.",
    "One is only\ntoo easily inclined to take such an impression lightly, and one admits\nso gladly the statements of the participators when they represent\neverything as simple and not at all serious.",
    "I dwell upon this\nimpression at length, because it is important to know that an erotic\nimpression after such an introversion, has a deep effect and is\nundervalued, possibly, by Miss Miller.",
    "The suddenly passing sickness is\nobscure and needs a psychologic interpretation which cannot be touched\nupon here because of lack of data.",
    "The phenomena now to be described can\nonly be explained as arising from a disturbance which reaches to the\nvery depths of her being.",
    "“From Naples to Livorno, the ship travelled for a night, during which\n  I slept more or less well,—my sleep, however, is seldom deep or\n  dreamless.",
    "It seemed to me as if my mother’s voice wakened me, just at\n  the end of the following dream.",
    "At first I had a vague conception of\n  the words, ‘When the morning stars sang together,’ which were the\n  praeludium of a certain confused representation of creation and of the\n  mighty chorals resounding through the universe.",
    "In spite of the\n  strange, contradictory and confused character which is peculiar to the\n  dream, there was mingled in it the chorus of an oratorio which has\n  been given by one of the foremost musical societies of New York, and\n  with that were also memories of Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost.’",
    "Then from\n  out of this whirl, there slowly emerged certain words, which arranged\n  themselves into three strophes and, indeed, they seemed to be in my\n  own handwriting on ordinary blue-lined writing paper on a page of my\n  old poetry book which I always carried around with me; in short, they\n  appeared to me exactly as some minutes later they were in reality in\n  my book.”",
    "Miss Miller now wrote down the following poem, which she rearranged\nsomewhat a few months later, to make it more nearly, in her opinion,\nlike the dream original.",
    "“When the Eternal first made Sound\n              A myriad ears sprang out to hear,\n              And throughout all the Universe\n              There rolled an echo deep and clear:\n              All glory to the God of Sound!",
    "“When the Eternal first made Light\n              A myriad eyes sprang out to look,\n              And hearing ears and seeing eyes\n              Once more a mighty choral took:\n              All glory to the God of Light!",
    "“When the Eternal first gave Love\n              A myriad hearts sprang into life;\n              Ears filled with music, eyes with light;\n              Pealed forth with hearts with love all rife:\n              All glory to the God of Love!”",
    "Before we enter upon Miss Miller’s attempt to bring to light through her\nsuppositions[64] the root of this subliminal creation, we will attempt a\nshort analytic survey of the material already in our possession.",
    "The\nimpression on the ship has already been properly emphasized, so that we\nneed have no further difficulty in gaining possession of the dynamic\nprocess which brought about this poetical revelation.",
    "It was made clear\nin the preceding paragraphs that Miss Miller possibly had not\ninconsiderably undervalued the importance of the erotic impression.",
    "This\nassumption gains in probability through experience, which shows that,\nvery generally, relatively weak erotic impressions are greatly\nundervalued.",
    "One can see this best in cases where those concerned,\neither from social or moral grounds, consider an erotic relation as\nsomething quite impossible; for example, parents and children, brothers\nand sisters, relations (homosexual) between older and younger men, and\nso on.",
    "If the impression is relatively slight, then it does not exist at\nall for the participators; if the impression is strong, then a tragic\ndependence arises, which may result in some great nonsense, or be\ncarried to any extent.",
    "This lack of understanding can go unbelievably\nfar; mothers, who see the first erections of the small son in their own\nbed, a sister who half-playfully embraces her brother, a twenty-year-old\ndaughter who still seats herself on her father’s lap, and then has\n“strange” sensations in her “abdomen.”",
    "They are all morally indignant to\nthe highest degree if one speaks of “sexuality.”",
    "Finally, our whole\neducation is carried on with the tacit agreement to know as little as\npossible of the erotic, and to spread abroad the deepest ignorance in\nregard to it.",
    "It is no wonder, therefore, that the judgment, _in\npuncto_, of the importance of an erotic impression is generally unsafe\nand inadequate.",
    "Miss Miller was under the influence of a deep erotic impression, as we\nhave seen.",
    "Because of the sum-total of the feelings aroused by this, it\ndoes not seem that this impression was more than dimly realized, for the\ndream had to contain a powerful repetition.",
    "From analytic experience,\none knows that the early dreams which patients bring for analysis are\nnone the less of especial interest, because of the fact that they bring\nout criticisms and valuations of the physician’s personality, which\npreviously, would have been asked for directly in vain.",
    "They enrich the\nconscious impression which the patient had of his physician, and often\nconcerning very important points.",
    "They are naturally erotic observations\nwhich the unconscious was forced to make, just because of the quite\nuniversal undervaluation and uncertain judgment of the relatively weak\nerotic impression.",
    "In the drastic and hyperbolic manner of expression of\nthe dream, the impression often appears in almost unintelligible form on\naccount of the immeasurable dimension of the symbol.",
    "A further\npeculiarity which seems to rest upon the historic strata of the\nunconscious, is this—that an erotic impression, to which conscious\nacknowledgment is denied, usurps an earlier and discarded transference\nand expresses itself in that.",
    "Therefore, it frequently happens, for\nexample, that among young girls at the time of their first love,\nremarkable difficulties develop in the capacity for erotic expression,\nwhich may be reduced analytically to disturbances through a regressive\nattempt at resuscitation of the father image, or the “Father-Imago.",
    "”[65]",
    "Indeed, one might presume something similar in Miss Miller’s case, for\nthe idea of the masculine creative deity is a derivation, analytically\nand historically psychologic, of the “Father-Imago,”[66] and aims, above\nall, to replace the discarded infantile father transference in such a\nway that for the individual the passing from the narrow circle of the\nfamily into the wider circle of human society may be simpler or made\neasier.",
    "In the light of this reflection, we can see, in the poem and its\n“Praeludium,” the religious, poetically formed product of an\nintroversion depending upon the surrogate of the “Father-Imago.”",
    "In\nspite of the incomplete apperception of the effectual impression,\nessential component parts of this are included in the idea of\ncompensation, as marks, so to speak, of its origin.",
    "(Pfister has coined\nfor this the striking expression, “Law of the Return of the Complex.”)\n",
    "The effectual impression was that of the officer singing in the night\nwatch, “When the morning stars sang together.”",
    "The idea of this opened a\nnew world to the girl.",
    "(Creation.)",
    "This creator has created tone, then light, and then love.",
    "That the first\nto be created should have been tone, can be made clear only\nindividually, for there is no cosmogony except the Gnosis of Hermes, a\ngenerally quite unknown system, which would have such tendencies.",
    "But\nnow we might venture a conjecture, which is already apparent, and which\nsoon will be proven thoroughly, viz., the following chain of\nassociations: the singer—the singing morning stars—the God of tone—the\nCreator—the God of Light—(of the sun)—(of the fire)—and of Love.",
    "The links of this chain are proven by the material, with the exception\nof sun and fire, which I put in parentheses, but which, however, will be\nproven through what follows in the further course of the analysis.",
    "All\nof these expressions, with one exception, belong to erotic speech.",
    "(“My\nGod, star, light; my sun, fire of love, fiery love,” etc.)",
    "“Creator”\nappears indistinct at first, but becomes understandable through the\nreference to the undertone of Eros, to the vibrating chord of Nature,\nwhich attempts to renew itself in every pair of lovers, and awaits the\nwonder of creation.",
    "Miss Miller had taken pains to disclose the unconscious creation of her\nmind to her understanding, and, indeed through a procedure which agrees\nin principle with psychoanalysis, and, therefore, leads to the same\nresults as psychoanalysis.",
    "But, as usually happens with laymen and\nbeginners, Miss Miller, because she had no knowledge of psychoanalysis,\nleft off at the thoughts which necessarily bring the deep complex lying\nat the bottom of it to light in an indirect, that is to say, censored\nmanner.",
    "More than this, a simple method, merely the carrying out of the\nthought to its conclusion, is sufficient to discover the meaning.",
    "Miss\nMiller finds it astonishing that her unconscious phantasy does not,\nfollowing the Mosaic account of creation, put light in the first place,\ninstead of tone.",
    "Now follows an explanation, theoretically constructed and correct ad\nhoc, the hollowness of which is, however, characteristic of all similar\nattempts at explanation.",
    "She says:",
    "“It is perhaps interesting to recall that Anaxagoras also had the\n  Cosmos arise out of chaos through a sort of whirlwind, which does not\n  happen usually without producing sound.[67]",
    "But at this time I had\n  studied no philosophy, and knew nothing either of Anaxagoras or of his\n  theories about the ‘νοῦς,’ which I, unconsciously, was openly\n  following.",
    "At that time, also, I was equally in complete ignorance of\n  Leibnitz, and, therefore, knew nothing of his doctrine ‘dum Deus\n  calculat, fit mundus.’”",
    "Miss Miller’s references to Anaxagoras and to Leibnitz both refer to\ncreation by means of thought; that is to say, that divine thought alone\ncould bring forth a new material reality, a reference at first not\nintelligible, but which will soon, however, be more easily understood.",
    "We now come to those fancies from which Miss Miller principally drew her\nunconscious creation.",
    "“In the first place, there is the ‘Paradise Lost’ by Milton, which we\n  had at home in the edition illustrated by Doré, and which had often\n  delighted me from childhood.",
    "Then the ‘Book of Job,’ which had been\n  read aloud to me since the time of my earliest recollection.",
    "Moreover,\n  if one compares the first words of ‘Paradise Lost’ with my first\n  verse, one notices that there is the same verse measure.",
    "“‘Of man’s first disobedience ...",
    "“‘When the Eternal first made sound.’",
    "“My poem also recalls various passages in Job, and one or two places\n  in Handel’s Oratorio ‘The Creation,’ which came out very indistinctly\n  in the first part of the dream.”[68]",
    "The “Lost Paradise” which, as is well known, is so closely connected\nwith the beginning of the world, is made more clearly evident by the\nverse—",
    "“Of man’s first disobedience”",
    "which is concerned evidently with the fall, the meaning of which need\nnot be shown any further.",
    "I know the objection which every one\nunacquainted with psychoanalysis will raise, viz., that Miss Miller\nmight just as well have chosen any other verse as an example, and that,\naccidentally, she had taken the first one that happened to appear which\nhad this content, also accidentally.",
    "As is well known, the criticism\nwhich we hear equally from our medical colleagues, and from our\npatients, is generally based on such arguments.",
    "This misunderstanding\narises from the fact that the law of causation in the psychical sphere\nis not taken seriously enough; that is to say, there are no accidents,\nno “just as wells.”",
    "It is so, and there is, therefore, a sufficient\nreason at hand why it is so.",
    "It is moreover true that Miss Miller’s poem\nis connected with the fall, wherein just that erotic component comes\nforth, the existence of which we have surmised above.",
    "Miss Miller neglects to tell which passages in Job occurred to her mind.\n",
    "These, unfortunately, are therefore only general suppositions.",
    "Take\nfirst, the analogy to the Lost Paradise.",
    "Job lost all that he had, and\nthis was due to an act of Satan, who wished to incite him against God.\n",
    "In the same way mankind, through the temptation of the serpent, lost\nParadise, and was plunged into earth’s torments.",
    "The idea, or rather the\nmood which is expressed by the reference to the Lost Paradise, is Miss\nMiller’s feeling that she had lost something which was connected with\nsatanic temptation.",
    "To her it happened, just as to Job, that she\nsuffered innocently, for she did not fall a victim to temptation.",
    "Job’s\nsufferings are not understood by his friends;[69] no one knows that\nSatan has taken a hand in the game, and that Job is truly innocent.",
    "Job\nnever tires of avowing his innocence.",
    "Is there a hint in that?",
    "We know\nthat certain neurotic and especially mentally diseased people\ncontinually defend their innocence against non-existent attacks;\nhowever, one discovers at a closer examination that the patient, while\nhe apparently defends his innocence without reason, fulfils with that a\n“Deckhandlung,” the energy for which arises from just those impulses,\nwhose sinful character is revealed by the contents of the pretended\nreproach and calumny.[70]",
    "Job suffered doubly, on one side through the loss of his fortune, on the\nother through the lack of understanding in his friends; the latter can\nbe seen throughout the book.",
    "The suffering of the misunderstood recalls\nthe figure of Cyrano de Bergerac—he too suffered doubly, on one side\nthrough hopeless love, on the other side through misunderstanding.",
    "He\nfalls, as we have seen, in the last hopeless battle against “Le\nMensonge, les Compromis, les Préjugés, les Lâchetés et la Sottise.—Oui,\nVous m’arrachez tout le laurier et la rose!”",
    "Job laments",
    "“God delivereth me to the ungodly,\n      And casteth me into the hands of the wicked,\n      I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;\n      ",
    "Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:",
    "“_He hath also set me up for his mark.\n      ",
    "His archers compass me round about_;\n      ",
    "He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;\n      He poureth out my gall upon the ground.\n      ",
    "He breaketh me with breach upon breach;\n      ",
    "He runneth upon me like a giant.",
    "”—_Job_ xvi: 11–15.",
    "The analogy of feeling lies in the suffering of the hopeless struggle\nagainst the more powerful.",
    "It is as if this conflict were accompanied\nfrom afar by the sounds of “creation,” which brings up a beautiful and\nmysterious image belonging to the unconscious, and which has not yet\nforced its way up to the light of the upper world.",
    "We surmise, rather\nthan know, that this battle has really something to do with creation,\nwith the struggles between negations and affirmations.",
    "The references to\nRostand’s “Cyrano” through the identification with Christian, to\nMilton’s “Paradise Lost,” to the sorrows of Job, misunderstood by his\nfriends, betray plainly that in the soul of the poet something was\nidentified with these ideas.",
    "She also has suffered like Cyrano and Job,\nhas lost paradise, and dreams of “creation,”—creation by means of\nthought—fruition through the whirlwind of Anaxagoras.[71]",
    "We once more submit ourselves to Miss Miller’s guidance:",
    "“I remember that when fifteen years old, I was once very much stirred\n  up over an article, read aloud to me by my mother, concerning the idea\n  which spontaneously produced its object.",
    "I was so excited that I could\n  not sleep all night because of thinking over and over again what that\n  could mean.",
    "“From the age of nine to sixteen, I went every Sunday to a\n  Presbyterian Church, in charge of which, at that time, was a very\n  cultured minister.",
    "In one of the earliest memories which I have\n  retained of him, I see myself as a very small girl sitting in a very\n  large pew, continually endeavoring to keep myself awake and pay\n  attention, without in the least being able to understand what he meant\n  when he spoke to us of Chaos, Cosmos and the Gift of Love (don\n  d’amour).”",
    "There are also rather early memories of the awakening of puberty (nine\nto sixteen) which have connected the idea of the cosmos springing from\nchaos with the “don d’amour.”",
    "The medium in which these associations\noccur is the memory of a certain very much honored ecclesiastic who\nspoke those dark words.",
    "From the same period of time comes the\nremembrance of that excitement about the idea of the “creative thought”\nwhich from itself “produced its object.”",
    "Here are two ways of creation\nintimated: the creative thought, and the mysterious reference to the\n“don d’amour.”",
    "At the time when I had not yet understood the nature of psychoanalysis,\nI had a fortunate opportunity of winning through continual observation a\ndeep insight into the soul of a fifteen-year-old girl.",
    "Then I\ndiscovered, with astonishment, what the contents of the unconscious\nphantasies are, and how far removed they are from those which a girl of\nthat age shows outwardly.",
    "There are wide-reaching phantasies of truly\nmythical fruitfulness.",
    "The girl was, in the split-off phantasy, the\nrace-mother of uncounted peoples.[72] If we deduct the poetically spoken\nphantasy of the girl, elements are left which at that age are common to\nall girls, for the unconscious content is to an infinitely greater\ndegree common to all mankind than the content of the individual\nconsciousness.",
    "For it is the condensation of that which is historically\nthe average and ordinary.",
    "Miss Miller’s problem at this age was the common human problem: “How am\nI to be creative?”",
    "Nature knows but one answer to that: “Through the\nchild (don d’amour!).”",
    "“But how is the child attained?”",
    "Here the\nterrifying problem emerges, which, as our analytic experience shows, is\nconnected with the father,[73] where it cannot be solved; because the\noriginal sin of incest weighs heavily for all time upon the human race.\n",
    "The strong and natural love which binds the child to the father, turns\naway in those years during which the humanity of the father would be all\ntoo plainly recognized, to the higher forms of the father, to the\n“Fathers” of the church, and to the Father God,[74] visibly represented\nby them, and in that there lies still less possibility of solving the\nproblem.",
    "However, mythology is not lacking in consolations.",
    "Has not the\n_logos_ become flesh too?",
    "Has not the divine _pneuma_, even the _logos_,\nentered the Virgin’s womb and lived among us as the son of man?",
    "That\nwhirlwind of Anaxagoras was precisely the divine νοῦς which from out of\nitself has become the world.",
    "Why do we cherish the image of the Virgin\nMother even to this day?",
    "Because it is always comforting and says\nwithout speech or noisy sermon to the one seeking comfort, “I too have\nbecome a mother,”—through the “idea which spontaneously produces its\nobject.”",
    "I believe that there is foundation enough at hand for a sleepless night,\nif those phantasies peculiar to the age of puberty were to become\npossessed of this idea—the results would be immeasurable!",
    "All that is\npsychologic has an under and an over meaning, as is expressed in the\nprofound remark of the old mystic: οὐρανὸς ἄνο, οὐρανὸς κάτο, αἰθέρα\nἄνο, αἰθέρα κάτο, πᾶν τοῦτο ἄνο, πᾶν τοῦτο κάτο, τοῦτο λαβὲ καὶ\nεὐτυχει[75]—",
    "We would show but slight justice, however, to the intellectual\noriginality of our author, if we were satisfied to trace back the\ncommotion of that sleepless night absolutely and entirely to the sexual\nproblem in a narrow sense.",
    "That would be but one-half, and truly, to\nmake use of the mystic’s expression, only the under half.",
    "The other half\nis the intellectual sublimation, which strives to make true in its own\nway the ambiguous expression of “the idea which produces its object\nspontaneously,”—_ideal creation in place of the real_.",
    "In such an intellectual accomplishment of an evidently very capable\npersonality, the prospect of a spiritual fruitfulness is something which\nis worthy of the highest aspiration, since for many it will become a\nnecessity of life.",
    "Also this side of the phantasy explains, to a great\nextent, the excitement, for it is a thought with a presentiment of the\nfuture; one of those thoughts which arise, to use one of Maeterlinck’s\nexpressions,[76] from the “inconscient supérieur,” that “prospective\npotency” of subliminal combinations.[77]",
    "I have had the opportunity of observing certain cases of neuroses of\nyears’ duration, in which, at the time of the beginning of the illness\nor shortly before, a dream occurred, often of visionary clarity.",
    "This\nimpressed itself inextinguishably upon the memory, and in analysis\nrevealed a hidden meaning to the patient which anticipated the\nsubsequent events of life; that is to say, their psychologic\nmeaning.[78] I am inclined to grant this meaning to the commotion of\nthat restless night, because the resulting events of life, in so far as\nMiss Miller consciously and unconsciously unveils them to us, are\nentirely of a nature to confirm the supposition that that moment is to\nbe considered as the inception and presentiment of a sublimated aim in\nlife.",
    "Miss Miller concludes the list of her fancies with the following\nremarks:",
    "“The dream seemed to me to come from a mixture of the representation\n  of ‘Paradise Lost,’ ‘Job,’ and ‘Creation,’ with ideas such as ‘thought\n  which spontaneously produces its object’: ‘the gift of love,’ ‘chaos,\n  and cosmos.’”",
    "In the same way as colored splinters of glass are combined in a\nkaleidoscope, in her mind fragments of philosophy, æsthetics and\nreligion would seem to be combined—",
    "“under the stimulating influence of the journey, and the countries\n  hurriedly seen, combined with the great silence and the indescribable\n  charm of the sea.",
    "‘Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus.’",
    "‘Only this,\n  and nothing more!’”",
    "With these words, Miss Miller shows us out, politely and energetically.\n",
    "Her parting words in her negation, confirmed over again in English,\nleave behind a curiosity; viz., what position is to be negated by these\nwords?",
    "“Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus”—that is to say, really, only\n“le charme impalpable de la mer”—and the young man who sang melodiously\nduring the night watch is long since forgotten, and no one is to know,\nleast of all the dreamer, that he was a morning star, who came before\nthe creation of a new day.[79]",
    "One should take care lest he satisfy\nhimself and the reader with a sentence such as “ce ne fut que cela.”\n",
    "Otherwise, it might immediately happen that one would become disturbed\nagain.",
    "This occurs to Miss Miller too, since she allowed an English\nquotation to follow,—“Only this, and nothing more,” without giving the\nsource, it is true.",
    "The quotation comes from an unusually effective\npoem, “The Raven” by Poe.",
    "The line referred to occurs in the following:",
    "“While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping\n     As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—\n     ‘’Tis some visitor.’",
    "I muttered, ‘tapping at my chamber door’—\n                         Only this, and nothing more.”",
    "The spectral raven knocks nightly at his door and reminds the poet of\nhis irrevocably lost “Lenore.”",
    "The raven’s name is “Nevermore,” and as a\nrefrain to every verse he croaks his horrible “Nevermore.”",
    "Old memories\ncome back tormentingly, and the spectre repeats inexorably “Nevermore.”\n",
    "The poet seeks in vain to frighten away the dismal guest; he calls to\nthe raven:",
    "“‘Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend,’ I shrieked,\n    upstarting—\n ‘Get thee back into the tempest and the night’s Plutonian shore!\n ",
    "Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n ",
    "Leave my loneliness unbroken, quit the bust above my door!\n ",
    "Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!’\n                     Quoth the raven, ‘Nevermore.’”",
    "That quotation, which, apparently, skips lightly over the situation,\n“Only this, and nothing more,” comes from a text which depicts in an\naffecting manner the despair over the lost Lenore.",
    "That quotation also\nmisleads our poet in the most striking manner.",
    "Therefore, she\nundervalues the erotic impression and the wide-reaching effect of the\ncommotion caused by it.",
    "It is this undervaluation, which Freud has\nformulated more precisely as “repression,” which is the reason why the\nerotic problem does not attain directly conscious treatment, and from\nthis there arise “these psychologic riddles.”",
    "The erotic impression\nworks in the unconscious, and, in its stead, pushes symbols forth into\nconsciousness.",
    "Thus, one plays hide-and-seek with one’s self.",
    "First, it\nis “the morning stars which sing together”; then “Paradise Lost”; then\nthe erotic yearning clothes itself in an ecclesiastical dress and utters\ndark words about “World Creation” and finally rises into a religious\nhymn to find there, at last, a way out into freedom, a way against which\nthe censor of the moral personality can oppose nothing more.",
    "The hymn\ncontains in its own peculiar character the marks of its origin.",
    "It thus\nhas fulfilled itself—the “Law of the Return of the Complex.”",
    "The night\nsinger, in this circuitous manner of the old transference to the\nFather-Priest, has become the “Eternal,” the “Creator,” the _God of\nTone, of Light, of Love_.",
    "The indirect course of the libido seems to be a way of sorrow; at least\n“Paradise Lost” and the parallel reference to Job lead one to that\nconclusion.",
    "If we take, in addition to this, the introductory intimation\nof the identification with Christian, which we see concludes with\nCyrano, then we are furnished with material which pictures the indirect\ncourse of the libido as truly a way of sorrow.",
    "It is the same as when\nmankind, after the sinful fall, had the burden of the earthly life to\nbear, or like the tortures of Job, who suffered under the power of Satan\nand of God, and who himself, without suspecting it, became a plaything\nof the superhuman forces which we no longer consider as metaphysical,\nbut as metapsychological.",
    "Faust also offers us the same exhibition of\nGod’s wager.",
    "_Mephistopheles_:",
    "What will you bet?",
    "There’s still a chance to gain him\n          If unto me full leave you give\n          Gently upon my road to train him!",
    "_Satan_:",
    "But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will\n  curse thee to thy face.—_Job_ i: 11.",
    "While in Job the two great tendencies are characterized simply as good\nand bad, the problem in Faust is a pronouncedly erotic one; viz., the\nbattle between sublimation and eros, in which the Devil is strikingly\ncharacterized through the fitting rôle of the erotic tempter.",
    "The erotic\nis lacking in Job; at the same time Job is not conscious of the conflict\nwithin his own soul; he even continuously disputes the arguments of his\nfriends who wish to convince him of evil in his own heart.",
    "To this\nextent, one might say that Faust is considerably more honorable since he\nopenly confesses to the torments of his soul.",
    "Miss Miller acts like Job; she says nothing, and lets the evil and the\ngood come from the other world, from the metapsychologic.",
    "Therefore, the\nidentification with Job is also significant in this respect.",
    "A wider,\nand, indeed, a very important analogy remains to be mentioned.",
    "The\ncreative power, which love really is, rightly considered from the\nnatural standpoint, remains as the real attribute of the Divinity,\nsublimated from the erotic impression; therefore, in the poem God is\npraised throughout as Creator.",
    "Job offers the same illustration.",
    "Satan is the destroyer of Job’s\nfruitfulness.",
    "God is the fruitful one himself, therefore, at the end of\nthe book, he gives forth, as an expression of his own creative power,\nthis hymn, filled with lofty poetic beauty.",
    "In this hymn, strangely\nenough, two unsympathetic representatives of the animal kingdom,\nbehemoth and the leviathan, both expressive of the crudest force\nconceivable in nature, are given chief consideration; the behemoth being\nreally the phallic attribute of the God of Creation.",
    "“Behold now behemoth, which I made as well as thee;\n      ",
    "He eateth grass as an ox.\n      Lo, now; his strength is in his loins,\n      And his force is in the muscles of his belly.\n      ",
    "He moveth his tail like a cedar:\n      ",
    "The sinews of his thighs are knit together.\n      ",
    "His bones are as tubes of brass;\n      ",
    "His limbs are like bars of iron.\n      ",
    "He is the chief of the ways of God:\n      ",
    "He only that made him giveth him his sword....\n      Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;\n      ",
    "He is confident though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.\n      ",
    "Shall any take him when he is on the watch.\n      ",
    "Or pierce through his nose with a snare?\n      ",
    "Canst thou draw leviathan with a fish-hook?\n      Or press down his tongue with a cord?...\n      ",
    "Lay thy hand upon him;\n      Remember the battle and do no more.\n      ",
    "None is so fierce that dare stir him up:\n      ",
    "Who then is he that can stand before me?\n      ",
    "Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?\n      ",
    "Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.”\n                        —_Job_ xl:",
    "15–20, 23–24; xli: 1, 8, 10–11.",
    "God says this in order to bring his power and omnipotence impressively\nbefore Job’s eyes.",
    "God is like the behemoth and the leviathan; the\nfruitful nature giving forth abundance,—the untamable wildness and\nboundlessness of nature,—and the overwhelming danger of the unchained\npower.[80]",
    "But what has destroyed Job’s earthly paradise?",
    "The unchained power of\nnature.",
    "As the poet lets it be seen here, God has simply turned his\nother side outwards for once; the side which man calls the devil, and\nwhich lets loose all the torments of nature on Job, naturally for the\npurpose of discipline and training.",
    "The God who created such\nmonstrosities, before whom the poor weak man stiffens with anxiety,\ntruly must hide qualities within himself which are food for thought.\n",
    "This God lives in the heart, in the unconscious, in the realm of\nmetapsychology.",
    "There is the source of the anxiety before the\nunspeakably horrible, and of the strength to withstand the horrors.",
    "The\nperson, that is to say his conscious “I,” is like a plaything, like a\nfeather which is whirled around by different currents of air; sometimes\nthe sacrifice and sometimes the sacrificer, and he cannot hinder either.\n",
    "The Book of Job shows us God at work both as creator and destroyer.",
    "Who\nis this God?",
    "A thought which humanity in every part of the world and in\nall ages has brought forth from itself and always again anew in similar\nforms; a power in the other world to which man gives praise, a power\nwhich creates as well as destroys, an idea necessary to life.",
    "Since,\npsychologically understood, the divinity is nothing else than a\nprojected complex of representation which is accentuated in feeling\naccording to the degree of religiousness of the individual, so God is to\nbe considered as the representative of a certain sum of energy (libido).\n",
    "This energy, therefore, appears projected (metaphysically) because it\nworks from the unconscious outwards, when it is dislodged from there, as\npsychoanalysis shows.",
    "As I have earlier made apparent in the “Bedeutung\ndes Vaters,” the religious instinct feeds upon the incestuous libido of\nthe infantile period.",
    "In the principal forms of religion which now\nexist, the father transference seems to be at least the moulding\ninfluence; in older religions, it seems to be the influence of the\nmother transference which creates the attributes of the divinity.",
    "The\nattributes of the divinity are omnipotence, a sternly persecuting\npaternalism ruling through fear (Old Testament) and a loving paternalism\n(New Testament).",
    "These are the attributes of the libido in that wide\nsense in which Freud has conceived this idea empirically.",
    "In certain\npagan and also in certain Christian attributes of divinity the maternal\nstands out strongly, and in the former the animal also comes into the\ngreatest prominence.[81] Likewise, the infantile, so closely interwoven\nwith religious phantasies, and from time to time breaking forth so\nviolently, is nowhere lacking.[82]",
    "All this points to the sources of the\ndynamic states of religious activity.",
    "These are those impulses which in\nchildhood are withdrawn from incestuous application through the\nintervention of the incest barrier and which, especially at the time of\npuberty, as a result of affluxes of libido coming from the still\nincompletely employed sexuality, are aroused to their own peculiar\nactivity.",
    "As is easily understood, that which is valuable in the\nGod-creating idea is not the form but the power, the libido.",
    "The\nprimitive power which Job’s Hymn of Creation vindicates, the\nunconditional and inexorable, the unjust and the superhuman, are truly\nand rightly attributes of libido, which “lead us unto life,” which “let\nthe poor be guilty,” and against which struggle is in vain.",
    "Nothing\nremains for mankind but to work in harmony with this will.",
    "Nietzsche’s\n“Zarathustra” teaches us this impressively.",
    "We see that in Miss Miller the religious hymn arising from the\nunconscious is the compensating amend for the erotic; it takes a great\npart of its materials from the infantile reminiscences which she\nreawakened into life by the introversion of the libido.",
    "Had this\nreligious creation not succeeded (and also had another sublimated\napplication been eliminated) then Miss Miller would have yielded to the\nerotic impression, either to its natural consequence or to a negative\nissue, which would have replaced the lost success in love by a\ncorrespondingly strong sorrow.",
    "It is well known that opinions are much\ndivided concerning the worth of this issue of an erotic conflict, such\nas Miss Miller has presented to us.",
    "It is thought to be much more\nbeautiful to solve unnoticed an erotic tension, in the elevated feelings\nof religious poetry, in which perhaps many other people can find joy and\nconsolation.",
    "One is wrong to storm against this conception from the\nradical standpoint of fanaticism for truth.",
    "I think that one should view with philosophic admiration the strange\npaths of the libido and should investigate the purposes of its\ncircuitous ways.",
    "It is not too much to say that we have herewith dug up the erotic root,\nand yet the problem remains unsolved.",
    "Were there not bound up with that\na mysterious purpose, probably of the greatest biological meaning, then\ncertainly twenty centuries would not have yearned for it with such\nintense longing.",
    "Doubtless, this sort of libidian current moves in the\nsame direction as, taken in the widest sense, did that ecstatic ideal of\nthe Middle Ages and of the ancient mystery cults, one of which became\nthe later Christianity.",
    "There is to be seen biologically in this ideal\nan exercise of psychologic projection (of the paranoidian mechanism, as\nFreud would express it).[83]",
    "The projection consists in the repressing\nof the conflict into the unconscious and the setting forth of the\nrepressed contents into seeming objectivity, which is also the formula\nof paranoia.",
    "The repression serves, as is well known, for the freeing\nfrom a painful complex from which one must escape by all means because\nits compelling and oppressing power is feared.",
    "The repression can lead\nto an apparent complete suppression which corresponds to a strong\nself-control.",
    "Unfortunately, however, self-control has limits which are\nonly too narrowly drawn.",
    "Closer observation of people shows, it is true,\nthat calm is maintained at the critical moment, but certain results\noccur which fall into two categories.",
    "_",
    "First_, the suppressed effect comes to the surface immediately\nafterwards; seldom directly, it is true, but ordinarily in the form of a\ndisplacement to another object (e. g. a person is, in official\nrelations, polite, submissive, patient, and so on, and turns his whole\nanger loose upon his wife or his subordinates).",
    "_",
    "Second_, the suppressed effect creates compensations elsewhere.",
    "For\nexample, people who strive for excessive ethics, who try always to\nthink, feel, and act altruistically and ideally, avenge themselves,\nbecause of the impossibility of carrying out their ideals, by subtle\nmaliciousness, which naturally does not come into their own\nconsciousness as such, but which leads to misunderstandings and unhappy\nsituations.",
    "Apparently, then, all of these are only “especially\nunfortunate circumstances,” or they are the guilt and malice of other\npeople, or they are tragic complications.",
    "One is, indeed, freed of the conscious conflict, nevertheless it lies\ninvisible at one’s feet, and is stumbled over at every step.",
    "The technic\nof the apparent suppressing and forgetting is inadequate because it is\nnot possible of achievement in the last analysis—it is in reality a mere\nmakeshift.",
    "The religious projection offers a much more effectual help.\n",
    "In this one keeps the conflict in sight (care, pain, anxiety, and so on)\nand gives it over to a personality standing outside of one’s self, the\nDivinity.",
    "The evangelical command teaches us this:",
    "“Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.",
    "”—_I Peter_\n  v: 7.",
    "“In nothing be anxious; but in every thing by prayer and\n  supplication ... let your requests be made known unto God.”—_Phil._\n  iv: 6.",
    "One must give the burdening complex of the soul consciously over to the\nDeity; that is to say, associate it with a definite representation\ncomplex which is set up as objectively real, as a person who answers\nthose questions, for us unanswerable.",
    "To this inner demand belongs the\ncandid avowal of sin and the Christian humility presuming such an\navowal.",
    "Both are for the purpose of making it possible for one to\nexamine one’s self and to know one’s self.[84] One may consider the\nmutual avowal of sins as the most powerful support to this work of\neducation (“Confess, therefore, your sins one to another.”—James",
    "v: 16).\n",
    "These measures aim at a conscious recognition of the conflicts,\nthoroughly psychoanalytic, which is also _a conditio sine qua non_ of\nthe psychoanalytic condition of recovery.",
    "Just as psychoanalysis in the\nhands of the physician, a secular method, sets up the real object of\ntransference as the one to take over the conflicts of the oppressed and\nto solve them, so the Christian religion sets up the Saviour, considered\nas real; “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness\nof sins....” (Eph.",
    "i: 7 and Col. i: 14.)[85] He is the deliverer and\nredeemer of our guilt, a God who stands above sin, “who did no sin,\nneither was guile found in his mouth” (Pet. ii: 22).",
    "“Who his own self\nbare our sins in his body upon the tree” (Pet. ii: 24).",
    "“Therefore\nChrist has been sacrificed once to take away the sins of many” (Heb. ix:\n28).",
    "The God, thus thought of, is distinguished as innocent in himself\nand as the self-sacrificer.",
    "(These qualities are true also for that\namount of energy—libido—which belongs to the representation complex\ndesignated the Redeemer.)",
    "The conscious projection towards which the\nChristian education aims, offers, therefore, a double benefit: first,\none is kept conscious of the conflict (sins) of two opposing tendencies\nmutually resistant, and through this one prevents a known trouble from\nbecoming, by means of repressing and forgetting, an unknown and\ntherefore so much more tormenting sorrow.",
    "Secondly, one lightens one’s\nburden by surrendering it to him to whom all solutions are known.",
    "One\nmust not forget that the individual psychologic roots of the Deity, set\nup as real by the pious, are concealed from him, and that he, although\nunaware of this, still bears the burden alone and is still alone with\nhis conflict.",
    "This delusion would lead infallibly to the speedy breaking\nup of the system, for Nature cannot indefinitely be deceived, but the\npowerful institution of Christianity meets this situation.",
    "The command\nin the book of James is the best expression of the psychologic\nsignificance of this: “Bear ye one another’s burdens.",
    "”[86]",
    "This is emphasized as especially important in order to preserve society\nupright through mutual love (Transference); the Pauline writings leave\nno doubt about this:",

    "”—_Heb._",
    "x: 24–25.",
    "We might say that the real transference taught in the Christian\ncommunity is the condition absolutely necessary for the efficacy of the\nmiracle of redemption; the first letter of John comes out frankly with\nthis:",
    "“He that loveth his brother abideth in the light.",
    "”—_I John_ ii: 10.",
    "“If we love one another, God abideth in us.",
    "”—_I John_ iv: 12.",
    "The Deity continues to be efficacious in the Christian religion only\nupon the foundation of brotherly love.",
    "Consequently, here too the\nmystery of redemption is the unresisting real transference.[87] One may\nproperly ask one’s self, for what then is the Deity useful, if his\nefficacy consists only in the _real transference_?",
    "To this also the\nevangelical message has a striking answer:",
    "“Men are all brothers in Christ.”",

    "_",
    "ix: 28.",
    "The condition of transference among brothers is to be such as between\nman and Christ, a spiritual one.",
    "As the history of ancient cults and\ncertain Christian sects shows, this explanation of the Christian\nreligion is an especially important one biologically, for the\npsychologic intimacy creates certain shortened ways between men which\nlead only too easily to that from which Christianity seeks to release\nthem, namely to the sexual relation with all those consequences and\nnecessities under which the really already highly civilized man had to\nsuffer at the beginning of our Christian era.",
    "For just as the ancient\nreligious experience was regarded distinctly as a bodily union with the\nDeity,[88] just so was worship permeated with sexuality of every kind.\n",
    "Sexuality lay only too close to the relations of people with each other.\n",
    "The moral degeneracy of the first Christian century produced a moral\nreaction arising out of the darkness of the lowest strata of society\nwhich was expressed in the second and third centuries at its purest in\nthe two antagonistic religions, Christianity on the one side, and\nMithracism on the other.",
    "These religions strove after precisely that\nhigher form of social intercourse symbolic of a projected “become flesh”\nidea (logos), whereby all those strongest impulsive energies of the\narchaic man, formerly plunging him from one passion into another,[89]\nand which seemed to the ancients like the compulsion of the evil\nconstellations, as εἱμαρμένη,[90] and which in the sense of later ages\nmight be translated as the driving force of the libido,[91] the δύναμις\nκινητική[92] of Zeno, could be made use of for social preservation.[93]",

    "“Do you ever come across a man unafraid in danger, untouched by\n  desires, happy in misfortune, peaceful in the midst of a storm,\n  elevated above ordinary mortals, on the same plane as the gods, does\n  not reverence seize you?",
    "Are you not compelled to say, ‘Such an\n  exalted being is certainly something different from the miserable body\n  which he inhabits?’",
    "A divine strength rules there, such an excellent\n  mind, full of moderation, raised above all trivialities, which smiles\n  at that which we others fear or strive after: a heavenly power\n  animates such a person, a thing of this kind does not exist without\n  the coöperation of a deity.",
    "The largest part of such a being belongs\n  to the region from which he came.",
    "Just as the sun’s rays touch the\n  earth in reality and yet are at home only there from whence they come,\n  so an eminent holy man associates with us.",
    "He is sent to us that we\n  may learn to know the divine better, and although with us, still\n  really belongs to his original home.",
    "He looks thither and reaches\n  towards it; among us he walks as an exalted being.”",
    "The people of this age had grown ripe for identification with the λόγος\n(word) “become flesh,” for the founding of a new fellowship, united by\none idea,[94] in the name of which people could love each other and call\neach other brothers.[95]",
    "The old vague idea of a μεσίτης (Messiah), of a\nmediator in whose name new ways of love would be created, became a fact,\nand with that humanity made an immense step forward.",
    "This had not been\nbrought about by a speculative, completely sophisticated philosophy, but\nby an elementary need in the mass of people vegetating in spiritual\ndarkness.",
    "The profoundest necessities had evidently driven them towards\nthat, since humanity did not thrive in a state of dissoluteness.[96]",
    "The\nmeaning of those cults—I speak of Christianity and Mithracism—is clear;\nit is a moral restraint of animal impulses.[97] The dynamic appearance\nof both religions betrays something of that enormous feeling of\nredemption which animated the first disciples and which we to-day\nscarcely know how to appreciate, for these old truths are empty to us.\n",
    "Most certainly we should still understand it, had our customs even a\nbreath of ancient brutality, for we can hardly realize in this day the\nwhirlwinds of the unchained libido which roared through the ancient Rome\nof the Cæsars.",
    "The civilized man of the present day seems very far\nremoved from that.",
    "He has become merely neurotic.",
    "So for us the\nnecessities which brought forth Christianity have actually been lost,\nsince we no longer understand their meaning.",
    "We do not know against what\nit had to protect us.[98] For enlightened people, the so-called\nreligiousness has already approached very close to a neurosis.",
    "In the\npast two thousand years Christianity has done its work and has erected\nbarriers of repression, which protect us from the sight of our own\n“sinfulness.”",
    "The elementary emotions of the libido have come to be\nunknown to us, for they are carried on in the unconscious; therefore,\nthe belief which combats them has become hollow and empty.",
    "Let whoever\ndoes not believe that a mask covers our religion, obtain an impression\nfor himself from the appearance of our modern churches, from which style\nand art have long since fled.",
    "With this we turn back to the question from which we digressed, namely,\nwhether or not Miss Miller has created something valuable with her poem.\n",
    "If we bear in mind under what psychologic or moral conditions\nChristianity came into existence; that is to say, at a time when fierce\nbrutality was an every-day spectacle, then we understand the religious\nseizure of the whole personality and the worth of that religion which\ndefended the people of the Roman culture against the visible storms of\nwickedness.",
    "It was not difficult for those people to remain conscious of\nsin, for they saw it every day spread out before their eyes.",
    "The\nreligious product was at that time the accomplishment of the total\npersonality.",
    "Miss Miller not only undervalues her “sins,” but the\nconnection between the “depressing and unrelenting need” and her\nreligious product has even escaped her.",
    "Thus her poetical creation\ncompletely loses the living value of a religious product.",
    "It is not much\nmore than a sentimental transformation of the erotic which is secretly\ncarried out close to consciousness and principally possesses the same\nworth as the manifest content of the dream[99] with its uncertain and\ndelusive perishableness.",
    "Thus the poem is properly only a dream become\naudible.",
    "To the degree that the modern consciousness is eagerly busied with\nthings of a wholly other sort than religion, religion and its object,\noriginal sin, have stepped into the background; that is to say, into the\nunconscious in great part.",
    "Therefore, to-day man believes neither in the\none nor in the other.",
    "Consequently the Freudian school is accused of an\nimpure phantasy, and yet one might convince one’s self very easily with\na rather fleeting glance at the history of ancient religions and morals\nas to what kind of demons are harbored in the human soul.",
    "With this\ndisbelief in the crudeness of human nature is bound up the disbelief in\nthe power of religion.",
    "The phenomenon, well known to every\npsychoanalyst, of the unconscious transformation of an erotic conflict\ninto religious activity is something _ethically wholly worthless_ and\nnothing but an hysterical production.",
    "Whoever, on the other hand, to his\nconscious sin just as consciously places religion in opposition, does\nsomething the greatness of which cannot be denied.",
    "This can be verified\nby a backward glance over history.",
    "Such a procedure is sound religion.\n",
    "_",
    "The unconscious recasting of the erotic into something religious lays\nitself open to the reproach of a sentimental and ethically worthless\npose._",
    "By means of the secular practice of the naïve projection which is, as we\nhave seen, nothing else than a veiled or indirect real-transference\n(through the spiritual, through the logos), Christian training has\nproduced a widespread weakening of the animal nature so that a great\npart of the strength of the impulses could be set free for the work of\nsocial preservation and fruitfulness.[100]",
    "This abundance of libido, to\nmake use of this singular expression, pursues with a budding renaissance\n(for example Petrarch) a course which outgoing antiquity had already\nsketched out as religious; viz., the way of the transference to\nnature.[101]",
    "The transformation of this libidinous interest is in great\npart due to the Mithraic worship, which was a nature religion in the\nbest sense of the word;[102] while the primitive Christians exhibited\nthroughout an antagonistic attitude to the beauties of this world.[103]\nI remember the passage of St. Augustine mentioned by J. Burckhardt:",
    "“Men draw thither to admire the heights of the mountains and the\n  powerful waves of the sea—and to turn away from themselves.”",
    "The foremost authority on the Mithraic cult, Franz Cumont,[104] says as\nfollows:",
    "“The gods were everywhere and mingled in all the events of daily life.\n  ",
    "The fire which cooked the means of nourishment for the believers and\n  which warmed them; the water which quenched their thirst and cleansed\n  them; also the air which they breathed, and the day which shone for\n  them, were the objects of their homage.",
    "Perhaps no religion has given\n  to its adherents in so large a degree as Mithracism opportunity for\n  prayer and motive for devotion.",
    "When the initiated betook himself in\n  the evening to the sacred grotto concealed in the solitude of the\n  forest, at every step new sensations awakened in his heart some\n  mystical emotion.",
    "The stars that shone in the sky, the wind that\n  whispered in the foliage, the spring or brook which hastened murmuring\n  to the valley, even the earth which he trod under his feet, were in\n  his eyes divine; and all surrounding nature a worshipful fear of the\n  infinite forces that swayed the universe.”",
    "These fundamental thoughts of Mithracism, which, like so much else of\nthe ancient spiritual life, arose again from their grave during the\nrenaissance are to be found in the beautiful words of Seneca:[105]",
    "“When you enter a grove peopled with ancient trees, higher than the\n  ordinary, and whose boughs are so closely interwoven that the sky\n  cannot be seen, the stately shadows of the wood, the privacy of the\n  place, and the awful gloom cannot but strike you, as with the presence\n  of a deity, or when we see some cave at the foot of a mountain\n  penetrating the rocks, not made by human hands, but hollowed out to\n  great depths by nature; it fills the mind with a religious fear; we\n  venerate the fountain-heads of great rivers; the sudden eruption of a\n  vast body of water from the secret places of the earth, obtains an\n  altar: we adore likewise the springs of warm baths, and either the\n  opaque quality or immense depths, hath made some lakes sacred.”",
    "All this disappeared in the transitory world of the Christian, only to\nbreak forth much later when the thought of mankind had achieved that\n_independence of the idea_ which could resist the æsthetic impression,\nso that thought was no longer fettered by the emotional effects of the\nimpression, but could rise to reflective observation.",
    "Thus man entered\ninto a new and independent relation to nature whereby the foundation was\nlaid for natural science and technique.",
    "With that, however, there\nentered in for the first time a displacement of the weight of interest;\nthere arose again real-transference which has reached its greatest\ndevelopment in our time.",
    "Materialistic interest has everywhere become\nparamount.",
    "Therefore, the realms of the spirit, where earlier the\ngreatest conflicts and developments took place, lie deserted and fallow;\nthe world has not only lost its God as the sentimentalists of the\nnineteenth century bewail, but also to some extent has lost its soul as\nwell.",
    "One, therefore, cannot wonder that the discoveries and doctrines\nof the Freudian school, with their wholly psychologic views, meet with\nan almost universal disapproval.",
    "Through the change of the centre of\ninterest from the inner to the outer world, the knowledge of nature has\nincreased enormously in comparison with that of earlier times.",
    "By this\nthe anthropomorphic conception of the religious dogmas has been\ndefinitely thrown open to question; therefore, the present-day religions\ncan only with the greatest difficulty close their eyes to this fact; for\nnot only has the intense interest been diverted from the Christian\nreligion, but criticism and the necessary correction have increased\ncorrespondingly.",
    "The Christian religion seems to have fulfilled its\ngreat biological purpose, in so far as we are able to judge.",
    "It has led\nhuman thought to independence, and has lost its significance, therefore,\nto a yet undetermined extent; in any case its dogmatic contents have\nbecome related to Mithracism.",
    "In consideration of the fact that this\nreligion has rendered, nevertheless, inconceivable service to education,\none cannot reject it “eo ipso” to-day.",
    "It seems to me that we might\nstill make use in some way of its form of thought, and especially of its\ngreat wisdom of life, which for two thousand years has been proven to be\nparticularly efficacious.",
    "The stumbling block is the _unhappy\ncombination of religion and morality_.",
    "That must be overcome.",
    "There\nstill remain traces of this strife in the soul, the lack of which in a\nhuman being is reluctantly felt.",
    "It is hard to say in what such things\nconsist; for this, ideas as well as words are lacking.",
    "If, in spite of\nthat, I attempt to say something about it, I do it parabolically, using\nSeneca’s words:[106]",
    "“Nothing can be more commendable and beneficial if you persevere in\n  the pursuit of wisdom.",
    "It is what would be ridiculous to wish for when\n  it is in your power to attain it.",
    "There is no need to lift up your\n  hands to Heaven, or to pray the servant of the temple to admit you to\n  the ear of the idol that your prayers may be heard the better.",
    "God is\n  near thee; he is with thee.",
    "Yes, Lucilius, a holy spirit resides\n  within us, the observer of good and evil, and our constant guardian.\n  ",
    "And as we treat him, he treats us; no good man is without a God.",
    "Could\n  any one ever rise above the power of fortune without his assistance?\n  ",
    "It is he that inspires us with thoughts, upright, just and pure.",
    "We do\n  not, indeed, pretend to say what God; but that a God dwells in the\n  breast of every good man is certain.”",
    "CHAPTER IV\n                          THE SONG OF THE MOTH",
    "A little later Miss Miller travelled from Geneva to Paris.",
    "She says:",
    "“My weariness on the railway was so great that I could hardly sleep an\n  hour.",
    "It was terrifically hot in the ladies’ carriage.”",
    "At four o’clock in the morning she noticed a moth that flew against the\nlight in her compartment.",
    "She then tried to go to sleep again.",
    "Suddenly\nthe following poem took possession of her mind.",
    "_The Moth to the Sun_",
    "“I longed for thee when first I crawled to consciousness.\n       ",
    "My dreams were all of thee when in the chrysalis I lay.\n       ",
    "Oft myriads of my kind beat out their lives\n       Against some feeble spark once caught from thee.\n       ",
    "And one hour more—and my poor life is gone;\n       ",
    "Yet my last effort, as my first desire, shall be\n       ",
    "But to approach thy glory; then, having gained\n       One raptured glance, I’ll die content.\n       ",
    "For I, the source of beauty, warmth and life\n       Have in his perfect splendor once beheld.”",
    "Before we go into the material which Miss Miller offers us for the\nunderstanding of the poem, we will again cast a glance over the\npsychologic situation in which the poem originated.",
    "Some months or weeks\nappear to have elapsed since the last direct manifestation of the\nunconscious that Miss Miller reported to us; about this period we have\nhad no information.",
    "We learn nothing about the moods and phantasies of\nthis time.",
    "If one might draw a conclusion from this silence it would be\npresumably that in the time which elapsed between the two poems, really\nnothing of importance had happened, and that, therefore, this poem is\nagain but a voiced fragment of the unconscious working of the complex\nstretching out over months and years.",
    "It is highly probable that it is\nconcerned with the same complex as before.[107]",
    "The earlier product, a\nhymn of creation full of hope, has, however, but little similarity to\nthe present poem.",
    "The poem lying before us has a truly hopeless,\nmelancholy character; moth and sun, two things which never meet.",
    "One\nmust in fairness ask, is a moth really expected to rise to the sun?",
    "We\nknow indeed the proverbial saying about the moth that flew into the\nlight and singed its wings, but not the legend of the moth that strove\ntowards the sun.",
    "Plainly, here, two things are connected in her thoughts\nthat do not belong together; first, the moth which fluttered around the\nlight so long that it burnt itself; and then, the idea of a small\nephemeral being, something like the day fly, which, in lamentable\ncontrast to the eternity of the stars, longs for an imperishable\ndaylight.",
    "This idea reminds one of Faust:",
    "“Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight’s glow\n       The green-embosomed houses glitter;\n       The glow retreats, done is the day of toil,\n       It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;\n       Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil\n       Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!\n       ",
    "Then would I see eternal Evening gild\n       The silent world beneath me glowing....\n       ",
    "Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;\n       The new-born impulse fires my mind,—\n       I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,\n       ",
    "The day before me and the night behind,\n       Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,—\n       A glorious dream!",
    "though now the glories fade.\n       ",
    "Alas!",
    "the wings that lift the mind no aid\n       Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.”",
    "Not long afterwards, Faust sees “the black dog roving there through\ncornfields and stubble,” the dog who is the same as the devil, the\ntempter, in whose hellish fires Faust has singed his wings.",
    "When he\nbelieved that he was expressing his great longing for the beauty of the\nsun and the earth, “he went astray thereover” and fell into the hands of\n“the Evil One.”",
    "“Yes, resolute to reach some brighter distance,\n            On earth’s fair sun I turn my back.”",
    "This is what Faust had said shortly before, in true recognition of the\nstate of affairs.",
    "The honoring of the beauty of nature led the Christian\nof the Middle Ages to pagan thoughts which lay in an antagonistic\nrelation to his conscious religion, just as once Mithracism was in\nthreatening competition with Christianity, for Satan often disguises\nhimself as an angel of light.[108]",
    "The longing of Faust became his ruin.",
    "The longing for the Beyond had\nbrought as a consequence a loathing for life, and he stood on the brink\nof self-destruction.[109]",
    "The longing for the beauty of this world led\nhim anew to ruin, into doubt and pain, even to Marguerite’s tragic\ndeath.",
    "His mistake was that he followed after both worlds with no check\nto the driving force of his libido, like a man of violent passion.",
    "Faust\nportrays once more the folk-psychologic conflict of the beginning of the\nChristian era, but what is noteworthy, in a reversed order.",
    "Against what fearful powers of seduction Christ had to defend himself by\nmeans of his hope of the absolute world beyond, may be seen in the\nexample of Alypius in Augustine.",
    "If any of us had been living in that\nperiod of antiquity, he would have seen clearly that that culture must\ninevitably collapse because humanity revolted against it.",
    "It is well\nknown that even before the spread of Christianity a remarkable\nexpectation of redemption had taken possession of mankind.",
    "The following\neclogue of Virgil might well be a result of this mood:",
    "“Ultima Cumæi venit jam carminis ætas;[110]\n           Magnus ab integro Sæclorum nascitur ordo,\n           Jam redit et Virgo,[111] redeunt Saturnia regna;\n           Jam nova progenies cælo demittitur alto.\n           ",
    "Tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum\n           Desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,\n           Casta fave Lucina: tuus jam regnat Apollo.",
    "“Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,\n           Inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.\n           Ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit\n           Permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis,\n           Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.",
    "”[112]",
    "The turning to asceticism resulting from the general expansion of\nChristianity brought about a new misfortune to many: monasticism and the\nlife of the anchorite.[113]",
    "Faust takes the reverse course; for him the ascetic ideal means death.\n",
    "He struggles for freedom and wins life, at the same time giving himself\nover to the Evil One; but through this he becomes the bringer of death\nto her whom he loves most, Marguerite.",
    "He tears himself away from pain\nand sacrifices his life in unceasing useful work, through which he saves\nmany lives.[114] His double mission as saviour and destroyer has already\nbeen hinted in a preliminary manner:",
    "_Wagner_:",
    "With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou\n              Receive the people’s honest veneration!",
    "_Faust_:",
    "Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,\n          Among these vales and hills surrounding,\n          Worse than the pestilence, have passed.\n          ",
    "Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;\n          And I must hear, by all the living,\n          The shameless murderers praised at last!",
    "A parallel to this double rôle is that text in the Gospel of Matthew\nwhich has become historically significant:",
    "“I came not to send peace, but a sword.",
    "”—_Matt.",
    "_",
    "x: 34.",
    "Just this constitutes the deep significance of Goethe’s Faust, that he\nclothes in words a problem of modern man which has been turning in\nrestless slumber since the Renaissance, just as was done by the drama of\nOedipus for the Hellenic sphere of culture.",
    "What is to be the way out\nbetween the Scylla of renunciation of the world and the Charybdis of the\nacceptance of the world?",
    "The hopeful tone, voiced in the “Hymn to the God of Creation,” cannot\ncontinue very long with our author.",
    "The pose simply promises, but does\nnot fulfil.",
    "The old longing will come again, for it is a peculiarity of\nall complexes worked over merely in the unconscious[115] that they lose\nnothing of their original amount of affect.",
    "Meanwhile, their outward\nmanifestations can change almost endlessly.",
    "One might therefore consider\nthe first poem as an unconscious longing to solve the conflict through\npositive religiousness, somewhat in the same manner as they of the\nearlier centuries decided their conscious conflicts by opposing to them\nthe religious standpoint.",
    "This wish does not succeed.",
    "Now with the\nsecond poem there follows a second attempt which turns out in a\ndecidedly more material way; its thought is unequivocal.",
    "Only once\n“having gained one raptured glance ...” and then—to die.",
    "From the realms of the religious world, the attention, just as in\nFaust,[116] turns towards the sun of this world, and already there is\nsomething mingled with it which has another sense, that is to say, _the\nmoth which fluttered so long around the light that it burnt its wings_.",
    "We now pass to that which Miss Miller offers for the better\nunderstanding of the poem.",
    "She says:",
    "“This small poem made a profound impression upon me.",
    "I could not, of\n  course, find immediately a sufficiently clear and direct explanation\n  for it.",
    "However, a few days later when I once more read a certain\n  philosophical work, which I had read in Berlin the previous winter,\n  and which I had enjoyed very much, (I was reading it aloud to a\n  friend), I came across the following words: ‘La même aspiration\n  passionnée de la mite vers l’étoile, de l’homme vers Dieu.’",
    "(The same\n  passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God.)",
    "I had\n  forgotten this sentence entirely, but it seemed very clear to me that\n  precisely these words had reappeared in my hypnagogic poem.",
    "In\n  addition to that it occurred to me that a play seen some years\n  previously, ‘La Mite et La Flamme,’ was a further possible cause of\n  the poem.",
    "It is easy to see how often the word ‘moth’ had been\n  impressed upon me.”",
    "The deep impression made by the poem upon the author shows that she put\ninto it a large amount of love.",
    "In the expression “aspiration\npassionnée” we meet the passionate longing of the moth for the star, of\nman for God, and indeed, the moth is Miss Miller herself.",
    "Her last\nobservation that the word “moth” was often impressed upon her shows how\noften she had noticed the word “moth” as applicable to herself.",
    "_",
    "Her\nlonging for God resembles the longing of the moth for the “star.”",
    "_",
    "The\nreader will recall that this expression has already had a place in the\nearlier material, “when the morning stars sang together,” that is to\nsay, the ship’s officer who sings on deck in the night watch.",
    "The\npassionate longing for God is the same as that longing for the singing\nmorning stars.",
    "It was pointed out at great length in the foregoing\nchapter that this analogy is to be expected: “Sic parvis componere magna\nsolebam.”",
    "It is shameful or exalted just as one chooses, that the divine longing\nof humanity, which is really the first thing to make it human, should be\nbrought into connection with an erotic phantasy.",
    "Such a comparison jars\nupon the finer feelings.",
    "Therefore, one is inclined in spite of the\nundeniable facts to dispute the connection.",
    "An Italian steersman with\nbrown hair and black moustache, and the loftiest, dearest conception of\nhumanity!",
    "These two things cannot be brought together; against this not\nonly our religious feelings revolt, but our taste also rebels.",
    "It would certainly be unjust to make a comparison of the two objects as\nconcrete things since they are so heterogeneous.",
    "One loves a Beethoven\nsonata but one loves caviar also.",
    "It would not occur to any one to liken\nthe sonata to caviar.",
    "It is a common error for one to judge the longing\naccording to the quality of the object.",
    "The appetite of the gourmand\nwhich is only satisfied with goose liver and quail is no more\ndistinguished than the appetite of the laboring man for corned beef and\ncabbage.",
    "The longing is the same; the object changes.",
    "Nature is\nbeautiful only by virtue of the longing and love given her by man.",
    "The\næsthetic attributes emanating from that has influence primarily on the\nlibido, which alone constitutes the beauty of nature.",
    "The dream\nrecognizes this well when it depicts a strong and beautiful feeling by\nmeans of a representation of a beautiful landscape.",
    "Whenever one moves\nin the territory of the erotic it becomes altogether clear how little\nthe object and how much the love means.",
    "The “sexual object” is as a rule\noverrated far too much and that only on account of the extreme degree to\nwhich libido is devoted to the object.",
    "Apparently Miss Miller had but little left over for the officer, which\nis humanly very intelligible.",
    "But in spite of that a deep and lasting\neffect emanates from this connection which places divinity on a par with\nthe erotic object.",
    "The moods which apparently are produced by these\nobjects do not, however, spring from them, but are manifestations of her\nstrong love.",
    "When Miss Miller praises either God or the sun she means\nher love, that deepest and strongest impulse of the human and animal\nbeing.",
    "The reader will recall that in the preceding chapter the following chain\nof synonyms was adduced: the singer—God of sound—singing morning\nstar—creator—God of Light—sun—fire—God of Love.",
    "At that time we had placed sun and fire in parentheses.",
    "Now they are\nentitled to their right place in the chain of synonyms.",
    "With the\nchanging of the erotic impression from the affirmative to the negative\nthe symbols of light occur as the paramount object.",
    "In the second poem\nwhere the longing is clearly exposed it is by no means the terrestrial\nsun.",
    "Since the longing has been turned away from the real object, its\nobject has become, first of all, a subjective one, namely, God.\n",
    "Psychologically, however, God is the name of a representation-complex\nwhich is grouped around a strong feeling (the sum of libido).",
    "Properly,\nthe feeling is what gives character and reality to the complex.[117]\n_The attributes and symbols of the divinity must belong in a consistent\nmanner to the feeling_ (_longing, love, libido, and so on_).",
    "If one\nhonors God, the sun or the fire, then one honors one’s own vital force,\nthe libido.",
    "It is as Seneca says: “God is near you, he is with you, in\nyou.”",
    "God is our own longing to which we pay divine honors.[118] If it\nwere not known how tremendously significant religion was, and is, this\nmarvellous play with one’s self would appear absurd.",
    "There must be\nsomething more than this, however, because, notwithstanding its\nabsurdity, it is, in a certain sense, conformable to the purpose in the\nhighest degree.",
    "To bear a God within one’s self signifies a great deal;\nit is a guarantee of happiness, of power, indeed even of omnipotence, as\nfar as these attributes belong to the Deity.",
    "To bear a God within one’s\nself signifies just as much as to be God one’s self.",

    "The anxiety in the\nface of the erotic fate is wholly understandable, for there is something\nimmeasurable therein.",
    "Fate usually hides unknown dangers, and the\nperpetual hesitation of the neurotic to venture upon life is easily\nexplained by his desire to be allowed to stand still, so as not to take\npart in the dangerous battle of life.[188] _Whoever renounces the chance\nto experience must stifle in himself the wish for it, and, therefore,\ncommits a sort of self-murder._",

    "Byron offers as a further motif for his\npoem the following passage from Coleridge: “_And woman wailing for her\nDemon lover_.”",

    "Before I enter upon the contents of this second part, it seems necessary\nto cast a backward glance over the singular train of thought which the\nanalysis of the poem “The Moth to the Sun” has produced.",
    "Although this\npoem is very different from the foregoing Hymn of Creation, closer\ninvestigation of the “longing for the sun” has carried us into the realm\nof the fundamental ideas of religion and astral mythology, which ideas\nare closely related to those considered in the first poem.",
    "The creative\nGod of the first poem, whose dual nature, moral and physical, was shown\nespecially clearly to us by Job, has in the second poem a new\nqualification of astral-mythological, or, to express it better, of\nastrological character.",
    "The God becomes the sun, and in this finds an\nadequate natural expression quite apart from the moral division of the\nGod idea into the heavenly father and the devil.",
    "The sun is, as Renan\nremarked, really the only rational representation of God, whether we\ntake the point of view of the barbarians of other ages or that of the\nmodern physical sciences.",
    "In both cases the sun is the parent God,\nmythologically predominantly the Father God, from whom all living things\ndraw life; He is the fructifier and creator of all that lives, the\nsource of energy of our world.",
    "The discord into which the soul of man\nhas fallen through the action of moral laws[204] can be resolved into\ncomplete harmony through the sun as the natural object which obeys no\nhuman moral law.",
    "The sun is not only beneficial, but also destructive;\ntherefore the zodiacal representation of the August heat is the\nherd-devouring lion whom the Jewish hero Samson[205] killed in order to\nfree the parched earth from this plague.",
    "Yet it is the harmonious and\ninherent nature of the sun to scorch, and its scorching power seems\nnatural to men.",
    "It shines equally on the just and on the unjust, and\nallows useful living objects to flourish as well as harmful ones.\n",
    "Therefore, the sun is adapted as is nothing else to represent the\nvisible God of this world.",
    "That is to say, that driving strength of our\nown soul, which we call libido, and whose nature it is to allow the\nuseful and injurious, the good and the bad to proceed.",
    "That this\ncomparison is no mere play of words is taught us by the mystics.",
    "When by\nlooking inwards (introversion) and going down into the depths of their\nown being they find “in their heart” the image of the Sun, they find\ntheir own love or libido, which with reason, I might say with physical\nreason, is called the Sun; for our source of energy and life is the Sun.\n",
    "Thus our life substance, as an energic process, is entirely Sun.",
    "Of what\nspecial sort this “Sun energy” seen inwardly by the mystic is, is shown\nby an example taken from the Hindoo mythology.[206] From the explanation\nof Part III of the “Shvetâshvataropanishad” we take the following\nquotation, which relates to the Rudra:[207]",
    "(2) “Yea, the one Rudra who all these worlds with ruling power doth\n  rule, stands not for any second.",
    "Behind those that are born he stands;\n  at ending time ingathers all the worlds he hath evolved, protector\n  (he).",
    "(3) “He hath eyes on all sides, on all sides surely hath faces, arms\n  surely on all sides, on all sides feet.",
    "With arms, with wings he\n  tricks them out, creating heaven and earth, the only God.",
    "(4) “Who of the gods is both the source and growth, the Lord of all,\n  the Rudra.",
    "Mighty seer; who brought the shining germ of old into\n  existence—may he with reason pure conjoin us.",
    "”[208]",
    "These attributes allow us clearly to discern the all-creator and in him\nthe Sun, which has wings and with a thousand eyes scans the world.[209]",

    "CHAPTER II\n            THE CONCEPTION",
    "AND THE GENETIC THEORY OF LIBIDO",
    "The chief source of the history of the analytic conception of libido is\nFreud’s “Three Contributions to the Sexual Theory.”",
    "There the term\nlibido is conceived by him in the original narrow sense of sexual\nimpulse, sexual need.",
    "Experience forces us to the assumption of a\ncapacity for displacement of the libido, because functions or\nlocalizations of non-sexual force are undoubtedly capable of taking up a\ncertain amount of libidinous sexual impetus, a libidinous afflux.[238]\nFunctions or objects could, therefore, obtain sexual value, which under\nnormal circumstances really have nothing to do with sexuality.[239] From\nthis fact results the Freudian comparison of the libido with a stream,\nwhich is divisible, which can be dammed up, which overflows into\nbranches, and so on.[240] Freud’s original conception does not interpret\n“everything sexual,” although this has been asserted by critics, but\nrecognizes the existence of certain forces, the nature of which are not\nwell known; to which Freud, however, compelled by the notorious facts\nwhich are evident to any layman, grants the capacity to receive\n“affluxes of libido.”",
    "The hypothetical idea at the basis is the symbol\nof the “Triebbündel”[241] (bundle of impulses), wherein the sexual\nimpulse figures as a partial impulse of the whole system, and its\nencroachment into the other realms of impulse is a fact of experience.\n",
    "The theory of Freud, branching off from this interpretation, according\nto which the motor forces of a neurotic system correspond precisely to\ntheir libidinous additions to other (non-sexual) functional impulses,\nhas been sufficiently proven as correct, it seems to me, by the work of\nFreud and his school.[242] Since the appearance of the “Three\nContributions,” in 1905, a change has taken place[243] in the libido\nconception; its field of application has been widened.",
    "An extremely\nclear example of this amplification is this present work.",
    "However, I\nmust state that Freud, as well as myself, saw the need of widening the\nconception of libido.",
    "It was paranoia, so closely related to dementia\npræcox, which seemed to compel Freud to enlarge the earlier limits of\nthe conception.",
    "The passage in question, which I will quote here, word\nfor word, reads:[244]",
    "“A third consideration which presents itself, in regard to the views\n  developed here, starts the query as to whether we should accept as\n  sufficiently effectual the universal receding of the libido from the\n  outer world, in order to interpret from that, the end of the world: or\n  whether in this case, the firmly rooted possession of the ‘I’ must not\n  suffice to uphold the rapport with the outer world.",
    "Then one must\n  either let that which we call possession of the libido (interest from\n  erotic sources) coincide with interest in general, or else take into\n  consideration the possibility that great disturbance in the\n  disposition of the libido can also induce a corresponding disturbance\n  in the possession of the ‘I.’ Now, these are the problems, which we\n  are still absolutely helpless and unfitted to answer.",
    "Things would be\n  different could we proceed from a safe fund of knowledge of instinct.\n  ",
    "But the truth is, we have nothing of that kind at our disposal.",
    "We\n  understand instinct as the resultant of the reaction of the somatic\n  and the psychic.",
    "We see in it the psychical representation of organic\n  forces and take the popular distinction between the ‘I’ impulse and\n  the sexual impulse, which appears to us to be in accord with the\n  biological double rôle of the individual being who aspires to his own\n  preservation as well as to the preservation of the species.",
    "But\n  anything beyond this is a structure, which we set up, and also\n  willingly let fall again in order to orient ourselves in the confusion\n  of the dark processes of the soul; we expect particularly, from the\n  psychoanalytic investigations into diseased soul processes, to have\n  certain decisions forced upon us in regard to questions of the theory\n  of instinct.",
    "This expectation has not yet been fulfilled on account of\n  the still immature and limited investigations in these fields.",
    "At\n  present the possibility of the reaction of libido disturbance upon the\n  possession of the ‘I’ can be shown as little as the reverse; the\n  secondary or induced disturbances of the libido processes through\n  abnormal changes in the ‘I.’ It is probable that processes of this\n  sort form the distinctive character of the psychoses.",
    "The conclusions\n  arising from this, in relation to paranoia, are at present uncertain.\n  ",
    "One cannot assert that the paranoiac has completely withdrawn his\n  interest from the outer world, nor withdrawn into the heights of\n  repression, as one sometimes sees in certain other forms of\n  hallucinatory psychoses.",
    "He takes notice of the outer world, he takes\n  account of its changes, he is stirred to explanations by their\n  influence, and therefore I consider it highly probable that the\n  changed relation to the world is to be explained, wholly or in great\n  part, by the deficiency of the libido interest.”",
    "In this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question whether the\nwell-known longing for reality of the paranoic dement (and the dementia\npræcox patients),[245] to whom I have especially called attention in my\nbook, “The Psychology of Dementia Præcox,”[246] is to be traced back to\nthe withdrawal of the “libidinous affluxes” alone, or whether this\ncoincides with the so-called objective interest in general.",
    "It is hardly\nto be assumed that the normal “fonction du réel” (Janet)[247] is\nmaintained only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest.",
    "The fact\nis that in very many cases reality disappears entirely, so that not a\ntrace of psychological adaptation or orientation can be recognized.\n",
    "Reality is repressed under these circumstances and replaced by the\ncontents of the complex.",
    "One must of necessity say that not only the\nerotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared, that is to\nsay, the whole adaptation to reality has ceased.",
    "To this category belong\nthe stuporose and catatonic automatons.",
    "I have previously made use of the expression “psychic energy” in my\n“Psychology of Dementia Præcox” because I was unable to establish the\ntheory of this psychosis upon the conception of the displacement of the\naffluxes of libido.",
    "My experience, at that time chiefly psychiatric, did\nnot enable me to understand this theory.",
    "However, the correctness of\nthis theory in regard to neuroses, strictly speaking the transference\nneuroses, was proven to me later after increased experience in the field\nof hysteria and compulsion neuroses.",
    "In the territory of these neuroses\nit is mainly a question whether any portion of the libido which is\nspared through the specific repression becomes introverted and\nregressive into earlier paths of transference; for example, the path of\nthe parental transference.[248] With that, however, the former\nnon-sexual psychologic adaptation to the environment remains preserved\nso far as it does not concern the erotic and its secondary positions\n(symptoms).",
    "The reality which is lacking to the patients is just that\nportion of the libido to be found in the neurosis.",
    "In dementia præcox,\non the contrary, not merely that portion of libido which is saved in the\nwell-known specific sexual repression is lacking for reality, but much\nmore than one could write down to the account of sexuality in a strict\nsense.",
    "The function of reality is lacking to such a degree that even the\nmotive power must be encroached upon in the loss.",
    "The sexual character\nof this must be disputed absolutely,[249] for reality is not understood\nto be a sexual function.",
    "Moreover, if that were so, the introversion of\nthe libido in the strict sense must have as a result a loss of reality\nin the neuroses, and, indeed, a loss which could be compared with that\nof dementia præcox.",
    "These facts have rendered it impossible for me to\ntransfer Freud’s theory of libido to dementia præcox, and, therefore, I\nam of the opinion that Abraham’s investigation[250] is hardly tenable\ntheoretically, from the standpoint of the Freudian theory of libido.",
    "If\nAbraham believes that through the withdrawal of the libido from the\nouter world the paranoid system or the schizophrenic symptomatology\nresults, then this assumption is not justified from the standpoint of\nthe knowledge of that time, because a mere libido introversion and\nregression leads, speedily, as Freud has clearly shown, into the\nneuroses, and, strictly speaking, into the transference neuroses, and\nnot into dementia præcox.",
    "Therefore, the transference of the libido\ntheory to dementia præcox is impossible, because this illness produces a\nloss of reality which cannot be explained by the deficiency of the\nlibido defined in this narrow sense.",
    "It affords me especial satisfaction that our teacher also, when he laid\nhis hand on the delicate material of the paranoic psychology, was forced\nto doubt the applicability of the conception of libido held by him at\nthat time.",
    "The sexual definition of this did not permit me to understand\nthose disturbances of function, which affect the vague territory of the\nhunger instinct just as much as that of the sexual instinct.",
    "For a long\ntime the theory of libido seemed to me inapplicable to dementia præcox.\n",
    "With increasing experience in analytical work, however, I became aware\nof a gradual change in my conception of libido.",
    "In place of the\ndescriptive definition of the “Three Contributions” there gradually grew\nup a generic definition of the libido, which rendered it possible for me\nto replace the expression “psychic energy” by the term “libido.”",
    "I was\nforced to ask myself whether indeed the function of reality to-day does\nnot consist only in its smaller part of libido sexualis and in the\ngreater part of other impulses?",
    "It is still a very important question\nwhether phylogenetically the function of reality is not, at least in\ngreat part, of sexual origin.",
    "To answer this question directly in regard\nto the function of reality is not possible, but we shall attempt to come\nto an understanding indirectly.",
    "A fleeting glance at the history of evolution is sufficient to teach\nus that countless complicated functions to which to-day must be\ndenied any sexual character were originally pure derivations from\nthe general impulse of propagation.",
    "During the ascent through the\nanimal kingdom an important displacement in the fundamentals of the\nprocreative instinct has taken place.",
    "The mass of the reproductive\nproducts with the uncertainty of fertilization has more and more\nbeen replaced by a controlled impregnation and an effective\nprotection of the offspring.",
    "In this way part of the energy required\nin the production of eggs and sperma has been transposed into the\ncreation of mechanisms for allurement and for protection of the\nyoung.",
    "Thus we discover the first instincts of art in animals used\nin the service of the impulse of creation, and limited to the\nbreeding season.",
    "The original sexual character of these biological\ninstitutions became lost in their organic fixation and functional\nindependence.",
    "Even if there can be no doubt about the sexual origin\nof music, still it would be a poor, unæsthetic generalization if one\nwere to include music in the category of sexuality.",
    "A similar\nnomenclature would then lead us to classify the cathedral of Cologne\nas mineralogy because it is built of stones.",
    "It can be a surprise\nonly to those to whom the history of evolution is unknown to find\nhow few things there really are in human life which cannot be\nreduced in the last analysis to the instinct of procreation.",
    "It\nincludes very nearly everything, I think, which is beloved and dear\nto us.",
    "We spoke just now of libido as the creative impulse and at\nthe same time we allied ourselves with the conception which opposes\nlibido to hunger in the same way that the instinct of the\npreservation of the species is opposed to the instinct of\nself-preservation.",
    "In nature, this artificial distinction does not\nexist.",
    "Here we see only a continuous life impulse, a will to live\nwhich will attain the creation of the whole species through the\npreservation of the individual.",
    "Thus far this conception coincides\nwith the idea of the Will in Schopenhauer, for we can conceive Will\nobjectively, only as a manifestation of an internal desire.",
    "This\nthrowing of psychological perceptions into material reality is\ncharacterized philosophically as “introjection.”",
    "(Ferenczi’s\nconception of “introjection” denoted the reverse, that is, the\ntaking of the outer world into the inner world.)[251] Naturally, the\nconception of the world was distorted by introjection.",
    "Freud’s\nconception of the principle of desire is a voluntary formulation of\nthe idea of introjection, while his once more voluntarily conceived\n“principle of reality” corresponds functionally to that which I\ndesignate as “corrective of reality,” and R. Avenarius[252]\ndesignates as “empiriokritische Prinzipialkoordination.”",
    "The\nconception of power owes its existence to this very introjection;\nthis has already been said expressively by Galileo in his remark\nthat its origin is to be sought in the subjective perception of the\nmuscular power of the individual.",
    "Because we have already arrived at\nthe daring assumption that the libido, which was employed originally\nin the exclusive service of egg and seed production, now appears\nfirmly organized in the function of nest-building, and can no longer\nbe employed otherwise; similarly this conception forces us to relate\nit to every desire, including hunger.",
    "For now we can no longer make\nany essential distinction between the will to build a nest and the\nwill to eat.",
    "This view brings us to a conception of libido, which\nextends over the boundaries of the physical sciences into a\nphilosophical aspect—to a conception of the will in general.",
    "I must\ngive this bit of psychological “Voluntarismus” into the hands of the\nphilosophers for them to manage.",
    "For the rest I refer to the words\nof Schopenhauer[253] relating to this.",
    "In connection with the\npsychology of this conception (by which I understand neither\nmetapsychology nor metaphysics) I am reminded here of the cosmogenic\nmeaning of Eros in Plato and Hesiod,[254] and also of the orphic\nfigure of Phanes, the “_shining one_,” the first created, the\n“father of Eros.”",
    "Phanes has also orphically the significance of\nPriapus; he is a god of love, bisexual and similar to the Theban\nDionysus Lysios.[255]",
    "The orphic meaning of Phanes is similar to\nthat of the Indian Kâma, the god of love, which is also the\ncosmogenic principle.",
    "To Plotinus, of the Neo-Platonic school, the\nworld-soul is the energy of the intellect.[256] Plotinus compares\n“The One,” the creative primal principle, with light in general; the\nintellect with the Sun (♂), the world-soul with the moon (♀).",
    "In\nanother comparison Plotinus compares “The One” with the Father, the\nintellect with the Son.[257] The “One” designated as Uranus is\ntranscendent.",
    "The son as Kronos has dominion over the visible world.\n",
    "The world-soul (designated as Zeus) appears as subordinate to him.\n",
    "The “One,” or the Usia of the whole existence is designated by\nPlotinus as hypostatic, also as the three forms of emanation, also\nμία οὐσία ἐν τρισὶν ὑποστάσεσιν.[258]",
    "As Drews observed, this is\nalso the formula of the Christian Trinity (God the Father, God the\nSon, and God the Holy Ghost) as it was decided upon at the councils\nof Nicea and Constantinople.[259] It may also be noticed that\ncertain early Christian sectarians attributed a maternal\nsignificance to the Holy Ghost (world-soul, moon).",
    "(See what follows\nconcerning Chi of Timæus.)",
    "According to Plotinus, the world-soul has\na tendency toward a divided existence and towards divisibility, the\n_conditio sine qua non_ of all change, creation and procreation\n(also a maternal quality).",
    "It is an “unending all of life” and\nwholly energy; it is a living organism of ideas, which attain in it\neffectiveness and reality.[260]",
    "The intellect is its procreator, its\nfather, which, having conceived it, brings it to development in\nthought.[261]",
    "“What lies enclosed in the intellect, comes to development in the\n  world-soul as logos, fills it with meaning and makes it as if\n  intoxicated with nectar.",

    "This fragment of the history of philosophy, which may easily be\nenlarged, shows the significance of the endopsychic perception of the\nlibido and of its symbolism in human thought.",
    "In the diversity of natural phenomena we see the desire, the libido, in\nthe most diverse applications and forms.",
    "We see the libido in the stage\nof childhood almost wholly occupied in the instinct of nutrition, which\ntakes care of the upbuilding of the body.",
    "With the development of the\nbody there are successively opened new spheres of application for the\nlibido.",
    "The last sphere of application, and surpassing all the others in\nits functional significance, is sexuality, which seems at first almost\nbound up with the function of nutrition.",
    "(Compare with this the\ninfluence on procreation of the conditions of nutrition in lower animals\nand plants.)",
    "In the territory of sexuality, the libido wins that\nformation, the enormous importance of which has justified us in the use\nof the term libido in general.",
    "Here the libido appears very properly as\nan impulse of procreation, and almost in the form of an undifferentiated\nsexual primal libido, as an energy of growth, which clearly forces the\nindividual towards division, budding, etc.",
    "(The clearest distinction\nbetween the two forms of libido is to be found among those animals in\nwhom the stage of nutrition is separated from the sexual stage by a\nchrysalis stage.)",
    "From that sexual primal libido which produced millions of eggs and seeds\nfrom one small creature derivatives have been developed with the great\nlimitation of the fecundity; derivatives in which the functions are\nmaintained by a special differentiated libido.",
    "This differentiated\nlibido is henceforth desexualized because it is dissociated from its\noriginal function of egg and sperma production; nor is there any\npossibility of restoring it to its original function.",
    "Thus, in general,\nthe process of development consists in an increasing transformation of\nthe primal libido which only produced products of generation to the\nsecondary functions of allurement and protection of the young.",
    "This now\npresupposes a very different and very complicated relation to reality, a\ntrue function of reality, which, functionally inseparable, is bound up\nwith the needs of procreation.",
    "Thus the altered mode of procreation\ncarries with it as a correlate a correspondingly heightened adaptation\nto reality.[264]",
    "In this way we attain an insight into certain primitive conditions of\nthe function of reality.",
    "It would be radically wrong to say that its\ncompelling power is a sexual one.",
    "It was a sexual one to a large extent.\n",
    "The process of transformation of the primal libido into secondary\nimpulses always took place in the form of affluxes of sexual libido,\nthat is to say, sexuality became deflected from its original destination\nand a portion of it turned, little by little, increasing in amount, into\nthe phylogenetic impulse of the mechanisms of allurement and of\nprotection of the young.",
    "This diversion of the sexual libido from the\nsexual territory into associated functions is still taking place.[265]\nWhere this operation succeeds without injury to the adaptation of the\nindividual it is called _sublimation_.",
    "Where the attempt does not\nsucceed it is called _repression_.",
    "The descriptive standpoint of psychology accepts the multiplicity of\ninstincts, among which is the sexual instinct, as a special phenomenon;\nmoreover, it recognizes certain affluxes of libido to non-sexual\ninstincts.",
    "Quite otherwise is the genetic standpoint.",
    "It regards the multiplicity\nof instincts as issuing from a relative unity, the primal libido;[266]\nit recognizes that definite amounts of the primal libido are split off,\nas it were, associated with the newly formed functions and finally\nmerged in them.",
    "As a result of this it is impossible, from the genetic\nstandpoint, to hold to the strictly limited conception of libido of the\ndescriptive standpoint; it leads inevitably to a broadening of the\nconception.",
    "With this we come to the theory of libido that I have\nsurreptitiously introduced into the first part of this work for the\npurpose of making this genetic conception familiar to the reader.",
    "The\nexplanation of this harmless deceit I have saved until the second part.",
    "For the first time, through this genetic idea of libido, which in every\nway surpasses the descriptive sexual, the transference was made possible\nof the Freudian libido theory into the psychology of mental disease.",
    "The\npassage quoted above shows how the present Freudian conception of libido\ncollides with the problem of the psychoses.[267] Therefore, when I speak\nof libido, I associate with it the genetic conception which contains not\nonly the immediate sexual but also an amount of desexualized primal\nlibido.",
    "When I say a sick person takes his libido away from the outer\nworld, in order to take possession of the inner world with it, I do not\nmean that he takes away merely the affluxes from the function of\nreality, but he takes energy away, according to my view, from those\ndesexualized instincts which regularly and properly support the function\nof reality.",
    "With this alteration in the libido conception, certain parts of our\nterminology need revision as well.",
    "As we know, Abraham has undertaken\nthe experiment of transferring the Freudian libido theory to dementia\npræcox and has conceived the characteristic lack of rapport and the\ncessation of the function of reality as autoerotism.",
    "This conception\nneeds revision.",
    "Hysterical introversion of the libido leads to\nautoerotism, since the patient’s erotic afflux of libido designed for\nthe function of adaptation is introverted, whereby his ego is occupied\nby the corresponding amount of erotic libido.",
    "The schizophrenic,\nhowever, shuns reality far more than merely the erotic afflux would\naccount for; therefore, his inner condition is very different from that\nof the hysteric.",
    "He is more than autoerotic, he builds up an\nintra-psychic equivalent for reality, for which purpose he has\nnecessarily to employ other dynamics than that afforded by the erotic\nafflux.",
    "Therefore, I must grant to Bleuler the right to reject the\nconception of autoerotism, taken from the study of hysterical neuroses,\nand there legitimate, and to replace it by the conception of\nautismus.[268] I am forced to say that this term is better fitted to\nfacts than autoerotism.",
    "With this I acknowledge my earlier idea of the\nidentity of autismus (Bleuler) and autoerotism (Freud) as unjustified,\nand, therefore, retract it.[269] This thorough revision of the\nconception of libido has compelled me to this.",
    "From these considerations it follows necessarily that the descriptive\npsychologic conception of libido must be given up in order for the\nlibido theory to be applied to dementia præcox.",
    "That it is there\napplicable is best shown in Freud’s brilliant investigation of\nSchreber’s phantasies.",
    "The question now is whether this genetic\nconception of libido proposed by me is suitable for the neuroses.",
    "I\nbelieve that this question may be answered affirmatively.",
    "“Natura non\nfecit saltum”—it is not merely to be expected but it is also probable\nthat at least temporary functional disturbances of various degrees\nappear in the neuroses, which transcend the boundaries of the immediate\nsexual; in any case, this occurs in psychotic episodes.",
    "I consider the\nbroadening of the conception of libido which has developed through the\nmost recent analytic work as a real advance which will prove of especial\nadvantage in the important field of the introversion psychoses.",
    "Proofs\nof the correctness of my assumption are already at hand.",
    "It has become\napparent through a series of researches of the Zurich School, which are\nnow published in part,[270] that the phantastic substitution products\nwhich take the place of the disturbed function of reality bear\nunmistakable traces of archaic thought.",
    "This confirmation is parallel to\nthe postulate asserted above, according to which reality is deprived,\nnot merely of an immediate (individual) amount of libido, but also of an\nalready differentiated or desexualized quantity of libido, which, among\nnormal people, has belonged to the function of reality ever since\nprehistoric times.",
    "_",
    "A dropping away of the last acquisition of the\nfunction of reality (or adaptation) must of necessity be replaced by an\nearlier mode of adaptation.",
    "_",
    "We find this principle already in the\ndoctrines of the neuroses, that is, that a repression resulting from the\nfailure of the recent transference is replaced by an old way of\ntransference, namely, through a regressive revival of the parent imago.\n",
    "In the transference neurosis (hysterical), where merely a part of the\n_immediate sexual_ libido is taken away from reality by the specific\nsexual repression, the substituted product is a phantasy of individual\norigin and significance, with only a trace of those archaic traits found\nin the phantasies of those mental disorders in which a portion of the\ngeneral human function of reality organized since antiquity has broken\noff.",
    "This portion can be replaced only by a generally valid archaic\nsurrogate.",
    "We owe a simple and clear example of this proposition to the\ninvestigation of Honegger.[271] A paranoic of good intelligence who has\na clear idea of the spherical form of the earth and its rotation around\nthe sun replaces the modern astronomical views by a system worked out in\ngreat detail, which one must call archaic, in which the earth is a flat\ndisc over which the sun travels.[272] (I am reminded of the sun-phallus\nmentioned in the first part of this book, for which we are also indebted\nto Honegger.)",
    "Spielrein has likewise furnished some very interesting\nexamples of archaic definitions which begin in certain illnesses to\noverlay the real meanings of the modern word.",
    "For example, Spielrein’s\npatient had correctly discovered the mythological significance of\nalcohol, the intoxicating drink, to be “an effusion of seed.",
    "”[273] She\nalso had a symbolism of boiling which I must place parallel to the\nespecially important alchemistic vision of Zosimos,[274] who found\npeople in boiling water within the cavity of the altar.[275] This\npatient used earth in place of mother, and also water to express\nmother.[276]",
    "I refrain from further examples because future work of the\nZurich School will furnish abundant evidence of this sort.",
    "My foregoing proposition of the replacement of the disturbed function of\nreality by an archaic surrogate is supported by an excellent paradox of\nSpielrein’s.",
    "She says: “I often had the illusion that these patients\nmight be simply victims of a folk superstition.”",
    "As a matter of fact,\npatients substitute phantasies for reality, phantasies similar to the\nactually incorrect mental products of the past, which, however, were\nonce the view of reality.",
    "As the Zosimos vision shows, the old\nsuperstitions were symbols[277] which permitted transitions to the most\nremote territory.",
    "This must have been very expedient for certain archaic\nperiods, for by this means convenient bridges were offered to lead a\npartial amount of libido over into the mental realm.",
    "Evidently Spielrein\nthinks of a similar biological meaning of the symbols when she\nsays:[278]",
    "“Thus a symbol seems to me to owe its origin in general to the\n  tendency of a complex for dissolution in the common totality of\n  thought....",
    "The complex is robbed by that of the personal element....\n  ",
    "This tendency towards dissolution (transformation) of every individual\n  complex is the motive for poetry, painting, for every sort of art.”",
    "When here we replace the formal conception “complex” by the conception\nof the quantity of libido (the total effect of the complex), which, from\nthe standpoint of the libido theory, is a justified measure, then does\nSpielrein’s view easily agree with mine.",
    "When primitive man understands\nin general what an act of generation is, then, according to the\nprinciple of the path of least resistance, he never can arrive at the\nidea of replacing the generative organs by a sword-blade or a shuttle;\nbut this is the case with certain Indians, who explain the origin of\nmankind by the union of the two transference symbols.",
    "He then must be\ncompelled to devise an analogous thing in order to bring a manifest\nsexual interest upon an asexual expression.",
    "The propelling motive of\nthis transition of the _immediate sexual_ libido to the non-sexual\nrepresentation can, in my opinion, be found only in a _resistance which\nopposes primitive sexuality_.",
    "It appears as if, by this means of phantastic analogy formation, more\nlibido would gradually become desexualized, because increasingly more\nphantasy correlates were put in the place of the primitive achievement\nof the sexual libido.",
    "With this an enormous broadening of the world idea\nwas gradually developed because new objects were always assimilated as\nsexual symbols.",
    "It is a question whether the human consciousness has not\nbeen brought to its present state entirely or in great part in this\nmanner.",
    "It is evident, in any case, that an important significance in\nthe development of the human mind is due to the impulse towards the\ndiscovery of analogy.",
    "We must agree thoroughly with Steinthal when he\nsays that an absolutely overweening importance must be granted to the\nlittle phrase “Gleich wie” (even as) in the history of the development\nof thought.",
    "It is easy to believe that the carryover of the libido to a\nphantastic correlate has led primitive man to a number of the most\nimportant discoveries.",
    "CHAPTER III\n THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LIBIDO.",
    "A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF PRIMITIVE HUMAN\n                              DISCOVERIES",
    "In the following pages I will endeavor to picture a concrete example of\nthe transition of the libido.",
    "I once treated a patient who suffered from\na depressive catatonic condition.",
    "The case was one of only a slight\nintroversion psychosis; therefore, the existence of many hysterical\nfeatures was not surprising.",
    "In the beginning of the analytic treatment,\nwhile telling of a very painful occurrence she fell into a\nhysterical-dreamy state, in which she showed all signs of sexual\nexcitement.",
    "For obvious reasons she lost the knowledge of my presence\nduring this condition.",
    "The excitement led to a masturbative act (frictio\nfemorum).",
    "This act was accompanied by a peculiar gesture.",
    "She made a\nvery _violent rotary motion_ with the forefinger of the left hand on the\nleft temple, as if she were boring a hole there.",
    "Afterwards there was\ncomplete amnesia for what had happened, and there was nothing to be\nlearned about the queer gesture with her hand.",
    "Although this act can\neasily be likened to a boring into the mouth, nose or ear, now\ntransferred to the temple, it belongs in the territory of infantile\nludus sexualis[279]—to the preliminary exercise preparatory to sexual\nactivity.",
    "Without really understanding it, this gesture, nevertheless,\nseemed very important to me.",
    "Many weeks later I had an opportunity to\nspeak to the patient’s mother, and from her I learned that her daughter\nhad been a very exceptional child.",
    "When only two years old she would sit\nwith her back to an open cupboard door for hours and rhythmically beat\nher head against the door[280]—to the distraction of the household.",
    "A\nlittle later, instead of playing as other children, she began to bore a\nhole with her finger in the plaster of the wall of the house.",
    "She did\nthis with little turning and scraping movements, and kept herself busy\nat this occupation for hours.",
    "She was a complete puzzle to her parents.\n",
    "From her fourth year she practised onanism.",
    "It is evident that in this\nearly infantile activity the preliminary stage of the later trouble may\nbe found.",
    "The especially remarkable features in this case are, first,\nthat the child did not carry out the action on its own body, and,\nsecondly, the assiduity with which it carried on the action.[281] One is\ntempted to bring these two facts into a causal relationship and to say,\nbecause the child does not accomplish this action on her own body,\nperhaps that is the reason of the assiduity, for by boring into the wall\nshe never arrives at the same satisfaction as if she executed the\nactivity onanistically on her own body.",
    "The very evident onanistic boring of the patient can be traced back to a\nvery early stage of childhood, which is prior to the period of local\nonanism.",
    "That time is still psychologically very obscure, because\nindividual reproductions and memories are lacking to a great extent, the\nsame as among animals.",
    "The race characteristics (manner of life)\npredominate during the entire life of the animal, whereas among men the\nindividual character asserts itself over the race type.",
    "Granting the\ncorrectness of this remark, we are struck with the apparently wholly\nincomprehensible individual activity of this child at this early age.",
    "We\nlearn from her later life history that her development, which is, as is\nalways the case, intimately interwoven with parallel external events,\nhas led to that mental disturbance which is especially well known on\naccount of its individuality and the originality of its productions, i.\ne. dementia præcox.",
    "The peculiarity of this disturbance, as we have\npointed out above, depends upon the predominance of the phantastic form\nof thought—of the infantile in general.",
    "From this type of thinking\nproceed all those numerous contacts with mythological products, and that\nwhich we consider as original and wholly individual creations are very\noften creations which are comparable with nothing but those of\nantiquity.",
    "I believe that this comparison can be applied to all\nformations of this remarkable illness, and perhaps also to this special\nsymptom of boring.",
    "We have already seen that the onanistic boring of the\npatient dated from a very early stage of childhood, that is to say, it\nwas reproduced from that period of the past.",
    "The sick woman fell back\nfor the first time into the early onanism only after she had been\nmarried many years, and following the death of her child, with whom she\nhad identified herself through an overindulgent love.",
    "When the child\ndied the still healthy mother was overcome by early infantile symptoms\nin the form of scarcely concealed fits of masturbation, which were\nassociated with this very act of boring.",
    "As already observed, the\nprimary boring appeared at a time which preceded the infantile onanism\nlocalized in the genitals.",
    "This fact is of significance in so far as\nthis boring differs thereby from a similar later practice which appeared\nafter the genital onanism.",
    "The later bad habits represent, as a rule, a\nsubstitution for repressed genital masturbation, or for an attempt in\nthis direction.",
    "As such these habits (finger-sucking, biting the nails,\npicking at things, boring into the ears and nose, etc.) may persist far\ninto adult life as regular symptoms of a repressed amount of libido.",
    "As has already been shown above, the libido in youthful individuals at\nfirst manifests itself in the nutritional zone, when food is taken in\nthe act of suckling with rhythmic movements and with every sign of\nsatisfaction.",
    "With the growth of the individual and the development of\nhis organs the libido creates for itself new avenues to supply its need\nof activity and satisfaction.",
    "The primary model of rhythmic activity,\nproducing pleasure and satisfaction, must now be transferred to the zone\nof other functions, with sexuality as its final goal.",
    "A considerable\npart of the “hunger libido” is transferred into the “sexual libido.”\n",
    "This transition does not take place suddenly at the time of puberty, as\nis generally supposed, but very gradually in the course of the greater\npart of childhood.",
    "The libido can free itself only with difficulty and\nvery slowly from that which is peculiar to the function of nutrition, in\norder to enter into the peculiarity of the sexual function.",
    "Two periods\nare to be distinguished in this state of transition, so far as I can\njudge—_the epoch of suckling and the epoch of the displaced rhythmic\nactivity_.",
    "Suckling still belongs to the function of nutrition, but\npasses beyond it, however, in that it is no longer the function of\nnutrition, but rhythmic activity, with pleasure and satisfaction as a\ngoal, without the taking of nourishment.",
    "Here the hand enters as an\nauxiliary organ.",
    "In the period of the displaced rhythmic activity the\nhand appears still more clearly as an auxiliary organ; the gaining of\npleasure leaves the mouth zone and turns to other regions.",
    "The\npossibilities are now many.",
    "As a rule, other openings of the body become\nthe objects of the libido interest; then the skin, and special portions\nof that.",
    "The activity expressed in these parts, which can appear as\nrubbing, boring, picking, and so on, follows a certain rhythm and serves\nto produce pleasure.",
    "After longer or shorter tarryings of the libido at\nthese stations, it passes onward until it reaches the sexual zone, and\nthere, for the first time, can be occasion for the beginning of\nonanistic attempts.",
    "In its migration the libido takes more than a little\nof the function of nutrition with it into the sexual zone, which readily\naccounts for the numerous and innate correlations between the functions\nof nutrition and sexuality.",
    "If, after the occupation of the sexual zone,\nan obstacle arises against the present form of application of the\nlibido, then there occurs, according to the well-known laws, a\nregression to the nearest station lying behind, to the two\nabove-mentioned periods.",
    "It is now of special importance that the epoch\nof the displaced rhythmic activity coincides in a general way with the\ntime of the development of the mind and of speech.",
    "I might designate the\nperiod from birth until the occupation of the sexual zone as the\npresexual stage of development.",
    "This generally occurs between the third\nand fifth year, and is comparable to the chrysalis stage in butterflies.\n",
    "It is distinguished by the irregular commingling of the elements of\nnutrition and of sexual functions.",
    "Certain regressions follow directly\nback to the presexual stage, and, judging from my experience, this seems\nto be the rule in the regression of dementia præcox.",
    "I will give two\nbrief examples.",
    "One case concerns a young girl who developed a catatonic\nstate during her engagement.",
    "When she saw me for the first time, she\ncame up suddenly, embraced me, and said, “Papa, give me something to\neat.”",
    "The other case concerns a young maidservant who complained that\npeople pursued her with electricity and that this caused a queer feeling\nin her genitals, “as if it ate and drank down there.”",
    "These regressive phenomena show that even from the distance of the\nmodern mind those early stages of the libido can be regressively\nreached.",
    "One may assume, therefore, that in the earliest states of human\ndevelopment this road was much more easily travelled than it is to-day.\n",
    "It becomes then a matter of great interest to learn whether traces of\nthis have been preserved in history.",
    "We owe our knowledge of the ethnologic phantasy of boring to the\nvaluable work of Abraham,[282] who also refers us to the writings of\nAdalbert Kuhn.[283] Through this investigation we learn that Prometheus,\nthe fire-bringer, may be a brother of the Hindoo Pramantha, that is to\nsay, of the masculine fire-rubbing piece of wood.",
    "The Hindoo\nfire-bringer is called Mâtariçvan, and the activity of the fire\npreparation is always designated in the hieratic text by the verb\n“manthâmi,”[284] which means _shaking_, _rubbing_, _bringing forth by\nrubbing_.",
    "Kuhn has put this verb in connection with the Greek μανθάνω,\nwhich means “to learn,” and has explained this conceptual\nrelationship.[285] The “tertium comparationis” might lie in the rhythm,\nthe movement to and fro in the mind.",
    "According to Kuhn, the root “manth”\nor “math” must be traced from μανθάνω (μάθημα, μάθησις) to προ-μηθέομαι\nto Προμηθεύς,[286] who is the Greek fire-robber.",
    "Through an unauthorized\nSanskrit word “pramâthyus,” which comes by way of “pramantha,” and which\npossesses the double meaning of “Rubber” and “Robber,” the transition to\nPrometheus was effected.",
    "With that, however, the prefix “pra” caused\nspecial difficulty, so that the whole derivation was doubted by a series\nof authors, and was held, in part, as erroneous.",
    "On the other hand, it\nwas pointed out that as the Thuric Zeus bore the especially interesting\ncognomen Προ-μανθεύς, thus Προ-μηθεύς might not be an original\nIndo-Germanic stem word that was related to the Sanskrit “pramantha,”\nbut might represent only a cognomen.",
    "This interpretation is supported by\na gloss of Hesychius, Ἰθάς: ὁ τῶν Τιτάνων κήρυξ Προμηθεύς.[287] Another\ngloss of Hesychius explains ἰθαίνομαι (ιαίνω) as θερμαίνομαι, through\nwhich Ἰθάς attains the meaning of “the flaming one,” analogous to Αἴθων\nor Φλεγύας.[288]",
    "The relation of Prometheus to pramantha could scarcely\nbe so direct as Kuhn conjectures.",
    "The question of an indirect relation\nis not decided with that.",
    "Above all, Προμηθεύς is of great significance\nas a surname for Ἰθάς, since the “flaming one” is the “fore-thinker.”\n(_Pramati_",
    "= precaution is also an attribute of Agni, although _pramati_\nis of another derivation.)",
    "Prometheus, however, belongs to the line of\nPhlegians which was placed by Kuhn in uncontested relationship to the\nIndian priest family of Bhṛgu.[289] The Bhṛgu are like Mâtariçvan (the\n“one swelling in the mother”), also fire-bringers.",
    "Kuhn quotes a\npassage, according to which Bhṛgu also arises from the flame like Agni.\n",
    "(“In the flame Bhṛgu originated.",
    "Bhṛgu roasted, but did not burn.”)",
    "This\nview leads to a root related to Bhṛgu, that is to say, to the Sanskrit\n_bhrây_ = to light, Latin _fulgeo_ and Greek φλέγω (Sanskrit _bhargas_ =\nsplendor, Latin _fulgur_).",
    "Bhṛgu appears, therefore, as “the shining\none.”",
    "Φλεγύας means a certain species of eagle, on account of its\nburnished gold color.",
    "The connection with φλέγειν, which signifies “to\nburn,” is clear.",
    "The Phlegians are also the fire eagles.[290] Prometheus\nalso belongs to the Phlegians.",
    "The path from Pramantha to Prometheus\npasses not through the word, but through the idea, and, therefore, we\nshould adopt this same meaning for Prometheus as that which Pramantha\nattains from the Hindoo fire symbolism.[291]",
    "The Pramantha, as the tool of Manthana (the fire sacrifice), is\nconsidered purely sexual in the Hindoo; the Pramantha as phallus, or\nman; the bored wood underneath as vulva, or woman.[292] The resulting\nfire is the child, the divine son Agni.",
    "The two pieces of wood are\ncalled in the cult Purûravas and Urvaçî, and were thought of personified\nas man and woman.",
    "The fire was born from the genitals of the woman.[293]\nAn especially interesting representation of fire production, as a\nreligious ceremony (manthana), is given by Weber:[294]",
    "“A certain sacrificial fire was lit by the rubbing together of two\n  sticks; one piece of wood is taken up with the words: ‘Thou art the\n  birthplace of the fire,’ and two blades of grass are placed upon it;\n  ‘Ye are the two testicles,’ to the ‘adhârarani’ (the underlying wood):\n  ‘Thou art Urvaçî’; then the utarârani (that which is placed on top) is\n  anointed with butter.",
    "‘Thou art Power.’",
    "This is then placed on the\n  adhârarani.",
    "‘Thou art Purûravas’ and both are rubbed three times.",
    "‘I\n  rub thee with the Gâyatrîmetrum: I rub thee with the Trishtubhmeṭrum:\n  I rub thee with the Jagatîmetrum.’”",
    "The sexual symbolism of this fire production is unmistakable.",
    "We see\nhere also the rhythm, the metre in its original place as sexual rhythm,\nrising above the mating call into music.",
    "A song of the Rigveda[295]\nconveys the same interpretation and symbolism:",
    "“Here is the gear for function, here tinder made ready for the spark.\n ",
    "Bring thou the matron:[296] we will rub Agni in ancient fashion forth.\n ",
    "In the two fire-sticks Jâtavedas lieth, even as the well-formed germ in\n    pregnant women;\n Agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with\n    oblations;\n Lay this with care on that which lies extended: straight hath she borne\n    the steer when made prolific.",

    "These examples, which allow us to recognize a clear sexual symbolism in\nthe generation of fire, prove, therefore, since they originate from\ndifferent times and different peoples, the existence of a universal\ntendency to credit to fire production not only a magical but also a\nsexual significance.",
    "This ceremonial or magic repetition of this very\nancient, long-outlived observance shows how insistently the human mind\nclings to the old forms, and how deeply rooted is this very ancient\nreminiscence of fire boring.",
    "One might almost be inclined to see in the\nsexual symbolism of fire production a relatively late addition to the\npriestly lore.",
    "This may, indeed, be true for the ceremonial elaboration\nof the fire mysteries, but whether originally the generation of fire was\nin general a sexual action, that is to say, a “coitus-play,” is still a\nquestion.",
    "That similar things occur among very primitive people we learn\nfrom the Australian tribe of the Watschandies,[302] who in the spring\nperform the following magic ceremonies of fertilization: They dig a hole\nin the ground, so formed and surrounded with bushes as to counterfeit a\nwoman’s genitals.",
    "They dance the night long around this hole; in\nconnection with this they hold spears in front of themselves in a manner\nto recall the penis in erection.",
    "They dance around the hole and thrust\ntheir spears into the ditch, while they cry to it, “Pulli nira, pulli\nnira, _wataka_!”",
    "(Non fossa, non fossa, sed cunnus!)",
    "Such obscene dances\nappear among other primitive races as well.[303]",
    "In this spring incantation are contained the elements of the coitus\nplay.[304] This play is nothing but a coitus game, that is to say,\noriginally this play was simply a coitus in the form of sacramental\nmating, which for a long time was a mysterious element among certain\ncults, and reappeared in sects.[305]",
    "In the ceremonies of Zinzendorf’s\nfollowers echoes of the coitus sacrament may be recognized; also in\nother sects.",
    "One can easily think that just as the above-mentioned Australian bushmen\nperform the coitus play in this manner the same performance could be\nenacted in another manner, and, indeed, in the form of fire production.\n",
    "Instead of through two selected human beings, the coitus was represented\nby two substitutes, by Purûravas and Urvaçi, by Phallus and Vulva, by\nborer and opening.",
    "Just as the primitive thought behind other customs is\nreally the sacramental coition so here the primal tendency is really the\nact itself.",
    "For the act of fertilization is the climax—the true festival\nof life, and well worthy to become the nucleus of a religious mystery.\n",
    "If we are justified in concluding that the symbolism of the hole in the\nearth used by the Watschandies for the fertilization of the earth takes\nthe place of the coitus, then the generation of fire could be considered\nin the same way as a substitute for coitus; and, indeed, it might be\nfurther concluded as a consequence of this reasoning that the invention\nof fire-making is also due to the need of supplying a symbol for the\nsexual act.[306]",
    "Let us return, for a moment, to the infantile symptom of boring.",
    "Let us\nimagine a strong adult man carrying on the boring with two pieces of\nwood with the same perseverance and the energy corresponding to that of\nthis child.",
    "He may very easily create fire by this play.",
    "But of greatest\nsignificance in this work is the rhythm.[307]",
    "This hypothesis seems to\nme psychologically possible, although it should not be said with this\nthat only in this way could the discovery of fire occur.",
    "It can result\njust as well by the striking together of flints.",
    "It is scarcely possible\nthat fire was created in only one way.",
    "All I want to establish here is\nmerely the psychologic process, the symbolic indications of which point\nto the possibility that in such a way was fire invented or prepared.",
    "The existence of the primitive coitus play or rite seems to me\nsufficiently proven.",
    "The only thing that is obscure is the energy and\nemphasis of the ritual play.",
    "It is well known that those primitive rites\nwere often of very bloody seriousness, and were performed with an\nextraordinary display of energy, which appears as a great contrast to\nthe well-known indolence of primitive humanity.",
    "Therefore, the ritual\nactivity entirely loses the character of play, and wins that of\npurposeful effort.",
    "If certain Negro races can dance the whole night long\nto three tones in the most monotonous manner, then, according to our\nidea, there is in this an absolute lack of the character of play\npastime; it approaches nearer to exercise.",
    "There seems to exist a sort\nof compulsion to transfer the libido into such ritual activity.",
    "If the\nbasis of the ritual activity is the sexual act, we may assume that it is\nreally the underlying thought and object of the exercise.",
    "Under these\ncircumstances, the question arises why the primitive man endeavors to\nrepresent the sexual act symbolically and with effort, or, if this\nwording appears to be too hypothetical, why does he exert energy to such\na degree only to accomplish practically useless things, which apparently\ndo not especially amuse him?[308]",
    "It may be assumed that the sexual act\nis more desirable to primitive man than such absurd and, moreover,\nfatiguing exercises.",
    "It is hardly possible but that a certain compulsion\nconducts the energy away from the original object and real purpose,\ninducing the production of surrogates.",
    "The existence of a phallic or\norgiastic cult does not indicate _eo ipso_ a particularly lascivious\nlife any more than the ascetic symbolism of Christianity means an\nespecially moral life.",
    "One honors that which one does not possess or\nthat which one is not.",
    "This compulsion, to speak in the nomenclature\nformulated above, removes a certain amount of libido from the real\nsexual activity, and creates a symbolic and practically valid substitute\nfor what is lost.",
    "This psychology is confirmed by the above-mentioned\nWatschandie ceremony; during the entire ceremony none of the men may\nlook at a woman.",
    "This detail again informs us from whence the libido is\nto be diverted.",
    "But this gives rise to the pressing question, Whence\ncomes this compulsion?",
    "We have already suggested above that the\nprimitive sexuality encounters a resistance which leads to a\nside-tracking of the libido on to substitution actions (analogy,\nsymbolism, etc.).",
    "It is unthinkable that it is a question of any outer\nopposition whatsoever, or of a real obstacle, since it occurs to no\nsavage to catch his elusive quarry with ritual charms; but it is a\nquestion of an internal resistance; will opposes will; libido opposes\nlibido, since a psychologic resistance as an energic phenomenon\ncorresponds to a certain amount of libido.",
    "The psychologic compulsion\nfor the transformation of the libido is based on an original division of\nthe will.",
    "I will return to this primal splitting of the libido in\nanother place.",
    "Here let us concern ourselves only with the problem of\nthe transition of the libido.",
    "The transition takes place, as has been\nrepeatedly suggested by means of shifting to an analogy.",
    "The libido is\ntaken away from its proper place and transferred to another substratum.",
    "The resistance against sexuality aims, therefore, at preventing the\nsexual act; it also seeks to crowd the libido away from the sexual\nfunction.",
    "We see, for example, in hysteria, how the specific repression\nblocks the real path of transference; therefore, the libido is obliged\nto take another path, and that an earlier one, namely, the incestuous\nroad which ultimately leads to the parents.",
    "Let us speak, however, of\nthe incest prohibition, which hindered the very first sexual\ntransference.",
    "Then the situation changes in so far that no earlier way\nof transference is left, except that of the presexual stage of\ndevelopment, where the libido was still partly in the function of\nnutrition.",
    "By a regression to the presexual material the libido becomes\nquasi-desexualized.",
    "But as the incest prohibition signifies only a\ntemporary and conditional restriction of the sexuality, thus only that\npart of the libido which is best designated as the incestuous component\nis now pushed back to the presexual stage.",
    "The repression, therefore,\nconcerns only that part of the sexual libido which wishes to fix itself\npermanently upon the parents.",
    "The sexual libido is only withdrawn from\nthe incestuous component, repressed upon the presexual stage, and there,\nif the operation is successful, desexualized, by which this amount of\nlibido is prepared for an asexual application.",
    "However, it is to be\nassumed that this operation is accomplished only with difficulty,\nbecause the incestuous libido, so to speak, must be artificially\nseparated from the sexual libido, with which, for ages, through the\nwhole animal kingdom, it was indistinguishably united.",
    "The regression of\nthe incestuous component must, therefore, take place, not only with\ngreat difficulty, but also carry with it into the presexual stage a\nconsiderable sexual character.",
    "The consequence of this is that the\nresulting phenomena, although stamped with the character of the sexual\nact, are, nevertheless, not really sexual acts _de facto_; they are\nderived from the presexual stage, and are maintained by the repressed\nsexual libido, therefore possess a double significance.",
    "Thus the fire\nboring is a coitus (and, to be sure, an incestuous one), but a\ndesexualized one, which has lost its immediate sexual worth, and is,\ntherefore, indirectly useful to the propagation of the species.",
    "The\npresexual stage is characterized by countless possibilities of\napplication, because the libido has not yet formed definite\nlocalizations.",
    "It therefore appears intelligible that an amount of\nlibido which reaches this stage through regression is confronted with\nmanifold possibilities of application.",
    "Above all, it is met with the\npossibility of a purely onanistic activity.",
    "But as the matter in\nquestion in the regressive component of libido is sexual libido, the\nultimate object of which is propagation, therefore it goes to the\nexternal object (Parents); it will also introvert with this destination\nas its essential character.",
    "The result, therefore, is that the purely\nonanistic activity turns out to be insufficient, and another object must\nbe sought for, which takes the place of the incest object.",
    "The nurturing\nmother earth represents the ideal example of such an object.",
    "The\npsychology of the presexual stage contributes the nutrition component;\nthe sexual libido the coitus idea.",
    "From this the ancient symbols of\nagriculture arise.",
    "In the work of agriculture hunger and incest\nintermingle.",
    "The ancient cults of mother earth and all the superstitions\nfounded thereon saw in the cultivation of the earth the fertilization of\nthe mother.",
    "The aim of the action is desexualized, however, for it is\nthe fruit of the field and the nourishment contained therein.",
    "The\nregression resulting from the incest prohibition leads, in this case, to\nthe new valuation of the mother; this time, however, not as a sexual\nobject, but as a nourisher.",
    "The discovery of fire seems to be due to a very similar regression to\nthe presexual stage, more particularly to the nearest stage of the\ndisplaced rhythmic manifestation.",
    "The libido, introverted from the\nincest prohibition (with the more detailed designation of the motor\ncomponents of coitus), when it reaches the presexual stage, meets the\nrelated infantile boring, to which it now gives, in accordance with its\nrealistic destination, an actual material.",
    "(Therefore the material is\nfittingly called “materia,” as the object is the mother as above.)",
    "As I\nsought to show above, the action of the infantile boring requires only\nthe strength and perseverance of an adult man and suitable “material” in\norder to generate fire.",
    "If this is so, it may be expected that analogous\nto our foregoing case of onanistic boring the generation of fire\noriginally occurred as such an act of quasi-onanistic activity,\nobjectively expressed.",
    "The demonstration of this can never be actually\nfurnished, but it is thinkable that somewhere traces of this original\nonanistic preliminary exercise of fire production have been preserved.",
    "I\nhave succeeded in finding a passage in a very old monument of Hindoo\nliterature which contains this transition of the sexual libido through\nthe onanistic phase in the preparation of fire.",
    "This passage is found in\nBrihadâranyaka-Upanishad:[309]",
    "“In truth, he (Âtman)[310] was as large as a woman and a man, when\n  they embrace each other.",
    "This, his own self, he divided into two\n  parts, out of which husband and wife were formed.[311] With her, he\n  copulated; from this humanity sprang.",
    "She, however, pondered: ‘How may\n  he unite with me after he has created me from himself?",
    "Now I shall\n  hide!’",
    "Then she became a cow; he, however, became a bull and mated\n  with her.",
    "From that sprang the horned cattle.",
    "Then she became a mare;\n  he, however, became a stallion; she became a she-ass; he, an ass, and\n  mated with her.",
    "From these sprang the whole-hoofed animals.",
    "She became\n  a goat; he became a buck; she became an ewe; he became a ram, and\n  mated with her.",
    "Thus were created goats and sheep.",
    "Thus it happened\n  that all that mates, even down to the ants, he created—then he\n  perceived: ‘Truly I myself am Creation, for I have created the whole\n  world!’",
    "Thereupon he rubbed his hands (held before the mouth) so that\n  he brought forth fire from his mouth, as from the mother womb, and\n  from his hands.”",
    "We meet here a peculiar myth of creation which requires a psychologic\ninterpretation.",
    "In the beginning the libido was undifferentiated and\nbisexual;[312]",
    "this was followed by differentiation into a male and a\nfemale component.",
    "From then on man knows what he is.",
    "Now follows a gap\nin the coherence of the thought where belongs that very resistance which\nwe have postulated above for the explanation of the urge for\nsublimation.",
    "Next follows the onanistic act of rubbing or boring (here\nfinger-sucking) transferred from the sexual zone, from which proceeds\nthe production of fire.[313] The libido here leaves its characteristic\nmanifestation as sexual function and regresses to the presexual stage,\nwhere, in conformity with the above explanation, it occupies one of the\npreliminary stages of sexuality, thereby producing, in the view\nexpressed in the Upanishad, the first human art, and from there, as\nsuggested by Kuhn’s idea of the root “manth,” perhaps the higher\nintellectual activity in general.",
    "This course of development is not\nstrange to the psychiatrist, for it is a well-known psychopathological\nfact that onanism and excessive activity of phantasy are very closely\nrelated.",
    "(The sexualizing-autonomizing of the mind through\nautoerotism[314] is so familiar a fact that examples of that are\nsuperfluous.)",
    "The course of the libido, as we may conclude from these\nstudies, originally proceeded in a similar manner as in the child, only\nin a reversed sequence.",
    "The sexual act was pushed out of its proper zone\nand was transferred into the analogous mouth zone[315]—the mouth\nreceiving the significance of the female genitals; the hand and the\nfingers, respectively, receiving the phallic meaning.[316]",
    "In this\nmanner the regressively reoccupied activity of the presexual stage is\ninvested with the sexual significance, which, indeed, it already\npossessed, in part, before, but in a wholly different sense.",
    "Certain\nfunctions of the presexual stage are found to be permanently suitable,\nand, therefore, are retained later on as sexual functions.",
    "Thus, for\nexample, the mouth zone is retained as of erotic importance, meaning\nthat its valuation is permanently fixed.",
    "Concerning the mouth, we know\nthat it also has a sexual meaning among animals, inasmuch as, for\nexample, stallions bite mares in the sexual act; also, cats, cocks, etc.\n",
    "A second significance of the mouth is as an instrument of speech, it\nserves essentially in the production of the mating call, which mostly\nrepresents the developed tones of the animal kingdom.",
    "As to the hand, we\nknow that it has the important significance of the contrectation organ\n(for example, among frogs).",
    "The frequent erotic use of the hand among\nmonkeys is well known.",
    "If there exists a resistance against the real\nsexuality, then the accumulated libido is most likely to cause a\nhyperfunction of those collaterals which are most adapted to compensate\nfor the resistance, that is to say, the nearest functions which serve\nfor the introduction of the act;[317] on one side the function of the\nhand, on the other that of the mouth.",
    "The sexual act, however, against\nwhich the opposition is directed is replaced by a similar act of the\npresexual stage, the classic case being either finger-sucking or boring.\n",
    "Just as among apes the foot can on occasions take the place of the hand,\nso the child is often uncertain in the choice of the object to suck, and\nputs the big toe in the mouth instead of the finger.",
    "This last movement\nbelongs to a Hindoo rite, only the big toe was not put in the mouth, but\nheld against the eye.[318] Through the sexual significance of the hand\nand mouth these organs, which in the presexual stage served to obtain\npleasure, are invested with a procreating power which is identical with\nthe above-mentioned destination, which aims at the external object,\nbecause it concerns the sexual or creating libido.",
    "When, through the\nactual preparation of fire, the sexual character of the libido employed\nin that is fulfilled, then the mouth zone remains without adequate\nexpression; only the hand has now reached its real, purely human goal in\nits first art.",
    "The mouth has, as we saw, a further important function, which has just\nas much sexual relation to the object as the hand, that is to say, the\nproduction of the mating call.",
    "In opening up the autoerotic ring\n(hand-mouth),[319] where the phallic hand became the fire-producing\ntool, the libido which was directed to the mouth zone was obliged to\nseek another path of functioning, which naturally was found in the\nalready existing love call.",
    "The excess of libido entering here must have\nhad the usual results, namely, the stimulation of the newly possessed\nfunction; hence an elaboration of the mating call.",
    "We know that from the primitive sounds human speech has developed.\n",
    "Corresponding to the psychological situation, it might be assumed that\nlanguage owes its real origin to this moment, when the impulse,\nrepressed into the presexual stage, turns to the external in order to\nfind an equivalent object there.",
    "The real thought as a conscious\nactivity is, as we saw in the first part of this book, a thinking with\npositive determination towards the external world, that is to say, a\n“speech thinking.”",
    "This sort of thinking seems to have originated at\nthat moment.",
    "It is very remarkable that this view, which was won by the\npath of reasoning, is again supported by old tradition and other\nmythological fragments.",
    "In Aitareyopanishad[320] the following quotation is to be found in\nthe doctrine of the development of man: “Being brooded-o’er, his\nmouth hatched out, like as an egg; from out his mouth (came) speech,\nfrom speech, the fire.”",
    "In Part II, where it is depicted how the\nnewly created objects entered man, it reads: “Fire, speech becoming,\nentered in the mouth.”",
    "These quotations allow us to plainly\nrecognize the intimate connection between fire and speech.[321]",
    "In\nBrihadâranyaka-Upanishad is to be found this passage:",
    "“‘Yayñavalkya,’ thus he spake, ‘when after the death of this man his\n  speech entereth the fire, his breath into the wind, his eye into the\n  sun, etc.’”",
    "A further quotation from the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad reads:",
    "“But when the sun is set, O Yayñavalkya, and the moon has set, and the\n  fire is extinguished, what then serves man as light?",
    "Then speech\n  serves him as light; then, by the light of speech he sits, and moves,\n  he carries on his work, and he returns home.",
    "But when the sun is set,\n  O Yayñavalkya, and the moon is set, and the fire extinguished, and the\n  voice is dumb, what then serves man as light?",
    "Then he serves himself\n  (Atman) as light; then, by the light of himself, he sits and moves,\n  carries on his work and returns home.”",
    "In this passage we notice that fire again stands in the closest relation\nto speech.",
    "Speech itself is called a “light,” which, in its turn, is\nreduced to the “light” of the Atman, the creating psychic force, the\nlibido.",
    "Thus the Hindoo metapsychology conceives speech and fire as\nemanations of the inner light from which we know that it is libido.\n",
    "Speech and fire are its forms of manifestation, the first human arts,\nwhich have resulted from its transformation.",
    "This common psychologic\norigin seems also to be indicated by certain results of philology.",

    "The original significance of these roots is “to burst forth,\nto emerge, to extrude, to well out,” with the associated idea of\nbubbling, boiling and roundness. _Belbel_, accompanied by the sign of\nthe obelisk, of originally phallic nature, means source of light.",
    "The\nobelisk itself had besides the names of _techenu_ and _men_ also the\nname _benben_, more rarely _berber_ and _belbel_.[324] The libido\nsymbolism makes clear this connection, it seems to me.",

    "As the old\nHindoos recognized in fire an emanation of the inner libido fire, so too\nthey recognized, in the intoxicating drink (Firewater, Soma-Agni, as\nrain and fire), an emanation of libido.",
    "The Vedic definition of Soma as\nseminal fluid confirms this interpretation.[332] The Soma significance\nof fire, similar to the significance of the body of Christ in the Last\nSupper (compare the Passover lamb of the Jews, baked in the form of a\ncross), is explained by the psychology of the presexual stage, where the\nlibido was still in part the function of nutrition.",
    "The “Soma” is the\n“nourishing drink,” the mythological characterization of which runs\nparallel to fire in its origin; therefore, both are united in Agni.",

    "Through\nthe retreat of the libido into the presexual stage it becomes clear why\nso many gods were either defined sexually or were devoured.",
    "As was shown by our discussion of fire preparation, the fire tool did\nnot receive its sexual significance as a later addition, but the sexual\nlibido was the motor power which led to its discovery, so that the later\nteachings of the priests were nothing but confirmations of its actual\norigin.",
    "Other primitive discoveries probably have acquired their sexual\nsymbolism in the same manner, being also derived from the sexual libido.",
    "In the previous statements, which were based on the Pramantha of the\nAgni sacrifice, we have concerned ourselves only with one significance\nof the word manthâmi or mathnâmi, that is to say, with that which\nexpresses the movement of rubbing.",

    "The legend of its discovery always expresses the\nproduction of fire as a robbery.",
    "(In this far it belongs to the motive\nwidely spread over the earth of the treasure difficult to attain.)",
    "The\nfact that in many places and not alone in India the preparation of fire\nis represented as having its origin in robbery, seems to point to a\nwidely spread thought, according to which the preparation of fire was\nsomething forbidden,",
    "something usurped or criminal, which could be\nobtained only through stratagem or deeds of violence (mostly through\nstratagem).[334] When onanism confronts the physician as a symptom it\ndoes so frequently under the symbol of secret pilfering, or crafty\nimposition, which always signifies the concealed fulfilment of a\nforbidden wish.[335] Historically, this train of thought probably\nimplies that the ritual preparation of fire was employed with a magic\npurpose, and, therefore, was pursued by official religions; then it\nbecame a ritual mystery,[336] guarded by the priests and surrounded with\nsecrecy.",
    "The ritual laws of the Hindoos threaten with severe punishment\nhim who prepares fire in an incorrect manner.",
    "The fact alone that\nsomething is mysterious means the same as something done in concealment;\nthat which must remain secret, which one may not see nor do; also\nsomething which is surrounded by severe punishment of body and soul;\ntherefore, presumably, _something forbidden_ which has received a\nlicense as a religious rite.",
    "After all has been said about the genesis\nof the preparation of fire, it is no longer difficult to guess what is\nthe forbidden thing; _it is onanism_.",
    "When I stated before that it might\nbe lack of satisfaction which breaks up the autoerotic ring of the\ndisplaced sexual activity transferred to the body itself, and thus opens\nwider fields of culture, I did not mention that this loosely closed ring\nof the displaced onanistic activity could be much more firmly closed,\nwhen man makes the other great discovery, that of true onanism.[337]\nWith that the activity is started in the proper place, and this, under\ncertain circumstances, may mean a satisfaction sufficient for a long\ntime, but at the expense of cheating sexuality of its real purpose.",
    "It\nis a fraud upon the natural development of things, because all the\ndynamic forces which can and should serve the development of culture are\nwithdrawn from it through onanism, since, instead of the displacement, a\nregression to the local sexual takes place, which is precisely the\nopposite of that which is desirable.",
    "Psychologically, however, onanism\nis a discovery of a significance not to be undervalued.",
    "One is protected\nfrom fate, since no sexual need then has the power to give one up to\nlife.",
    "For with onanism one has the greatest magic in one’s hands; one\nneeds only to phantasy, and with that to masturbate, then one possesses\nall the pleasure of the world, and is no longer compelled to conquer the\nworld of one’s desires through hard labor and wrestling with\nreality.[338]",
    "Aladdin rubs his lamp and the obedient genii stand at his\nbidding; thus the fairy tale expresses the great psychologic advantage\nof the easy regression to the local sexual satisfaction.",
    "Aladdin’s\nsymbol subtly confirms the ambiguity of the magic fire preparation.",
    "The close relation of the generation of fire to the onanistic act is\nillustrated by a case, the knowledge of which I owe to Dr. Schmid, in\nCery, that of an imbecile peasant youth who set many incendiary fires.\n",
    "At one of these conflagrations he drew suspicion to himself by his\nbehavior.",
    "He stood with his hands in his trouser pockets in the door of\nan opposite house and gazed with apparent delight at the fire.",
    "Under\nexamination in the insane asylum, he described the fire in great detail,\nand made suspicious movements in his trouser pockets with his hands.",
    "The\nphysical examination undertaken at once showed that he had masturbated.\n",
    "Later he confessed that he had masturbated at the time when he had\nenjoyed the fire which he had enkindled himself.",
    "The preparation of fire in itself is a perfectly ordinary useful custom,\nemployed everywhere for many centuries, which in itself involved nothing\nmore mysterious than eating and drinking.",
    "However, there was always a\ntendency from time to time to prepare fire in a ceremonious and\nmysterious manner (exactly as with ritual eating and drinking), which\nwas to be carried out in an exactly prescribed way and from which no one\ndared differ.",
    "This mysterious tendency associated with the technique is\nthe second path in the onanistic regression, always present by the side\nof culture.",
    "The strict rules applied to it, the zeal of the ceremonial\npreparations and the religious awe of the mysteries next originate from\nthis source; the ceremonial, although apparently irrational, is an\nextremely ingenious institution from the psychologic standpoint, for it\nrepresents a substitute for the possibility of onanistic regression\naccurately circumscribed by law.",
    "The law cannot apply to the content of\nthe ceremony, for it is really quite indifferent for the ritual act,\nwhether it is carried out in this way or in that way.",
    "On the contrary,\nit is very essential whether the restrained libido is discharged through\na sterile onanism or transposed into the path of sublimation.",
    "These\nsevere measures of protection apply primarily to onanism.[339]",
    "I am indebted to Freud for a further important reference to the\nonanistic nature of the fire theft, or rather the motive of _the\ntreasure difficult of attainment_ (to which fire theft belongs).\n",
    "Mythology contains repeated formulas which read approximately as\nfollows: The treasure must be plucked or torn off from a taboo tree\n(Paradise tree, Hesperides); this is a forbidden and dangerous act.",
    "The\nclearest example of this is the old barbaric custom in the service of\nDiana of Aricia: only he can become a priest of the goddess who, in her\nsacred grove, dares to tear off (“abzureissen”) a bough.",
    "The tearing off\nhas been retained in vulgar speech (besides “abreiben,” rubbing) as a\nsymbol of the act of onanism.",
    "Thus “reiben,” to rub, is like “reissen,”\nto break off, both of which are contained in manthami and united\napparently only through the myth of the fire theft bound up in the act\nof onanism in a deeper stratum wherein “reiben,” properly speaking,\n“reissen,” is employed, but in a transferred sense.",
    "Therefore, it might\nperhaps be anticipated that in the deepest stratum, namely, the\nincestuous, which precedes the autoerotic stage,[340] the two meanings\ncoincide, which, through lack of mythological tradition, can perhaps be\ntraced through etymology only.",

    "With this,\nsymbolism leaves the impersonal and neuter realm, which characterizes\nthe astral and meteorologic symbol, and takes human form: the figure of\na being changing from sorrow to joy, from joy to sorrow, and which, like\nthe sun, sometimes stands in its zenith, sometimes is plunged in darkest\nnight, and arises from this very night to new splendor.[341] Just as the\nsun, guided by its own internal laws, ascends from morn till noon, and\npassing beyond the noon descends towards evening, leaving behind its\nsplendor, and then sinks completely into the all-enveloping night, thus,\ntoo, does mankind follow his course according to immutable laws, and\nalso sinks, after his course is completed, into night, in order to rise\nagain in the morning to a new cycle in his children.",

    "All information is lacking regarding this period, during which\nthe great problem surely survived in the unconscious.",
    "Perhaps this lack\nhas its advantages in that our interest is not diverted from the\nuniversal applicability of the phantasy here produced by sympathy in\nregard to the personal fate of the author.",

    "The condition depicted by the author here corresponds to such a one as\nusually precedes an intentional somnambulism[342] often described by\nspiritualistic mediums.",
    "A certain inclination to listen to these low\nnocturnal voices must be assumed; otherwise such fine and hardly\nperceptible inner experiences pass unnoticed.",
    "We recognize in this\nlistening a current of the libido leading inward and beginning to flow\ntowards a still invisible, mysterious goal.",
    "It seems that the libido has\nsuddenly discovered an object in the depths of the unconscious which\npowerfully attracts it.",
    "The life of man, turned wholly to the external\nby nature, does not ordinarily permit such introversion; there must,\ntherefore, be surmised a certain exceptional condition, that is to say,\na lack of external objects, which compels the individual to seek a\nsubstitute for them in his own soul.",
    "It is, however, difficult to\nimagine that this rich world has become too poor to offer an object for\nthe love of human atoms; nor can the world and its objects be held\naccountable for this lack.",
    "It offers boundless opportunities for every\none.",
    "It is rather the _incapacity to love which robs mankind of his\npossibilities_.",
    "This world is empty to him alone who does not understand\nhow to direct his libido towards objects, and to render them alive and\nbeautiful for himself, for Beauty does not indeed lie in things, but in\nthe feeling that we give to them.",
    "That which compels us to create a\nsubstitute for ourselves is not the external lack of objects, but our\nincapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of ourselves.",
    "Certainly\nthe difficulties of the conditions of life and the adversities of the\nstruggle for existence may oppress us, yet even adverse external\nsituations would not hinder the giving out of the libido; on the\ncontrary, they may spur us on to the greatest exertions, whereby we\nbring our whole libido into reality.",
    "Real difficulties alone will never\nbe able to force the libido back permanently to such a degree as to give\nrise, for example, to a neurosis.",
    "_",
    "The conflict, which is the condition\nof every neurosis, is lacking.",
    "_",
    "The resistance, which opposes its\nunwillingness to the will, alone has the power to produce that\npathogenic introversion which is the starting point of every psychogenic\ndisturbance.",
    "The resistance against loving produces the inability to\nlove.",
    "Just as the normal libido is comparable to a steady stream which\npours its waters broadly into the world of reality, so the resistance,\ndynamically considered, is comparable, not so much to a rock rearing up\nin the river bed which is flooded over or surrounded by the stream, as\nto a backward flow towards the source.",
    "A part of the soul desires the\nouter object; another part, however, harks back to the subjective world,\nwhere the airy and fragile palaces of phantasy beckon.",
    "One can assume\nthe dualism of the human will for which Bleuler, from the psychiatric\npoint of view, has coined the word “ambitendency”[343] as something\ngenerally present, bearing in mind that even the most primitive motor\nimpulse is in opposition; as, for example, in the act of extension, the\nflexor muscles also become innervated.",
    "This normal ambitendency,\nhowever, never leads to an inhibition or prevention of the intended act,\nbut is the indispensable preliminary requirement for its perfection and\ncoördination.",
    "For a resistance disturbing to this act to arise from this\nharmony of finely attuned opposition an abnormal plus or minus would be\nneeded on one or the other side.",
    "The resistance originates from this\nadded third.[344]",
    "This applies also to the duality of the will, from\nwhich so many difficulties arise for mankind.",
    "The abnormal third frees\nthe pair of opposites, which are normally most intimately united, and\ncauses their manifestation in the form of separate tendencies; it is\nonly thus that they become willingness and unwillingness, which\ninterfere with each other.",

    "Taken at the roots in the case of our patients, the “nuclear\ncomplex” (Freud) reveals itself as the _incest problem_.",
    "The sexual\nlibido regressing to the parents appears as the incest tendency.",
    "The\nreason this path is so easily travelled is due to the enormous indolence\nof mankind, which will relinquish no object of the past, but will hold\nit fast forever.",
    "The “sacrilegious backward grasp” of which Nietzsche\nspeaks reveals itself, stripped of its incest covering, as an original\npassive arrest of the libido in its first object of childhood.",
    "This\nindolence is also a passion, as La Rochefoucauld[346] has brilliantly\nexpressed it:",
    "“Of all passions, that which is least known to ourselves is indolence:\n  it is the most ardent and malignant of them all, although its violence\n  may be insensible, and the injuries it causes may be hidden; if we\n  will consider its power attentively, we will see that it makes itself,\n  upon all occasions, mistress of our sentiments, of our interests, and\n  of our pleasures; it is the anchor, which has the power to arrest the\n  largest vessels; it is a calm more dangerous to the most important\n  affairs than rocks and the worst tempest.",
    "The repose of indolence is a\n  secret charm of the soul which suddenly stops the most ardent pursuits\n  and the firmest resolutions; finally to give the true idea of this\n  passion, one must say that indolence is like a beatitude of the soul\n  which consoles it for all its losses and takes the place of all its\n  possessions.”",
    "This dangerous passion, belonging above all others to primitive man,\nappears under the hazardous mask of the incest symbol, from which the\nincest fear must drive us away, and which must be conquered, in the\nfirst place, under the image of the “terrible mother.",
    "”[347]",
    "It is the\nmother of innumerable evils, not the least of which are neurotic\ntroubles.",
    "For, especially from the fogs of the arrested remnants of the\nlibido, arise the harmful phantasmagoria which so veil reality that\nadaptation becomes almost impossible.",
    "However, we will not investigate\nany further in this place the foundations of the incest phantasies.",
    "The\npreliminary suggestion of my purely psychologic conception of the incest\nproblem may suffice.",
    "We are here only concerned with the question\nwhether _resistance_ which leads to introversion in our author signifies\na conscious external difficulty or not.",
    "If it were an external\ndifficulty, then, indeed, the libido would be violently dammed back, and\nwould produce a flood of phantasies, which can best be designated as\nschemes, that is to say, plans as to how the obstacles could be\novercome.",
    "They would be very concrete ideas of reality which seek to\npave the way for solutions.",
    "It would be a strenuous meditation, indeed,\nwhich would be more likely to lead to anything rather than to a\nhypnagogic poem.",
    "The passive condition depicted above in no way fits in\nwith a real external obstacle, but, precisely through its passive\nsubmission, it indicates a tendency which doubtless scorns real\nsolutions and prefers phantastic substitutes.",
    "Ultimately and essentially\nwe are, therefore, dealing with an internal conflict, perhaps after the\nmanner of those earlier conflicts which led to the two first unconscious\ncreations.",
    "We, therefore, are forced to conclude that the external\nobject cannot be loved, because a predominant amount of libido prefers a\nphantastic object, which must be brought up from the depths of the\nunconscious as a compensation for the missing reality.",
    "The visionary phenomena, produced in the first stages of introversion,\nare grouped among the well-known phenomena[348] of hypnagogic vision.\n",
    "They form, as I explained in an earlier paper, the foundation of the\ntrue visions of the symbolic autorevelations of the libido, as we may\nnow express it.",
    "Miss Miller continues:",
    "“Then I had the impression that some communication was immediately\n  impending.",
    "It seemed to me as if there were re-echoed in me the words,\n  ‘Speak, O Lord, for Thy servant listens; open Thou mine ears!’”",
    "This passage very clearly describes the intention; the expression\n“communication” is even a current term in spiritualistic circles.",
    "The\nBiblical words contain a clear invocation or “prayer,” that is to say, a\nwish (libido) directed towards divinity (the unconscious complex).",
    "The\nprayer refers to Samuel, i:3, where Samuel at night was three times\ncalled by God, but believed that it was Eli calling, until the latter\ninformed him that it was God himself who spoke, and that he must answer\nif his name was called again—“Speak, O Lord, for Thy Servant hears!”",
    "The\ndreamer uses these words really in an inverse sense, namely, in order to\nproduce God with them.",
    "With that she directs her desires, her libido,\ninto the depths of her unconscious.",
    "We know that, although individuals are widely separated by the\ndifferences in the contents of their consciousness, they are closely\nalike in their unconscious psychology.",
    "It is a significant impression\nfor one working in practical psychoanalysis when he realizes how uniform\nare the typical unconscious complexes.",
    "Difference first arises from\nindividualization.",
    "This fact gives to an essential portion of the\nSchopenhauer and Hartmann philosophies a deep psychologic\njustification.[349]",
    "The very evident uniformity of the unconscious\nmechanism serves as a psychologic foundation for these philosophic\nviews.",
    "The unconscious contains the differentiated remnants of the\nearlier psychologic functions overcome by the individual\ndifferentiation.",
    "The reaction and products of the animal psyche are of a\ngenerally diffused uniformity and solidity, which, among men, may be\ndiscovered apparently only in traces.",
    "Man appears as something\nextraordinarily individual in contrast with animals.",
    "This might be a tremendous delusion, because we have the appropriate\ntendency always to recognize only the difference of things.",
    "This is\ndemanded by the psychologic adaptation which, without the most minute\ndifferentiation of the impressions, would be absolutely impossible.",
    "In\nopposition to this tendency we have ever the greatest difficulty in\nrecognizing in their common relations the things with which we are\noccupied in every-day life.",
    "This recognition becomes much easier with\nthings which are more remote from us.",
    "For example, it is almost\nimpossible for a European to differentiate the faces in a Chinese\nthrong, although the Chinese have just as individual facial formations\nas the Europeans, but the similarity of their strange facial expression\nis much more evident to the remote onlooker than their individual\ndifferences.",
    "But when we live among the Chinese then the impression of\ntheir uniformity disappears more and more, and finally the Chinese\nbecome individuals also.",
    "Individuality belongs to those conditional\nactualities which are greatly overrated theoretically on account of\ntheir practical significance.",
    "It does not belong to those overwhelmingly\nclear and therefore universally obtrusive general facts upon which a\nscience must primarily be founded.",
    "The individual content of\nconsciousness is, therefore, the most unfavorable object imaginable for\npsychology, because it has veiled the universally valid until it has\nbecome unrecognizable.",
    "The essence of consciousness is the process of\nadaptation which takes place in the most minute details.",
    "On the other\nhand, the unconscious is the generally diffused, which not only binds\nthe individuals among themselves to the race, but also unites them\nbackwards with the peoples of the past and their psychology.",
    "Thus the\nunconscious, surpassing the individual in its generality, is, in the\nfirst place, the object of a true psychology, which claims not to be\npsychophysical.",
    "Man as an individual is a suspicious phenomenon, the right of whose\nexistence from a natural biological standpoint could be seriously\ncontested, because, from this point of view, the individual is only a\nrace atom, and has a significance only as a mass constituent.",
    "The\nethical standpoint, however, gives to the human being an individual\ntendency separating him from the mass, which, in the course of\ncenturies, led to the development of personality, hand in hand with\nwhich developed the hero cult, and has led to the modern individualistic\ncult of personages.",
    "The attempts of rationalistic theology to keep hold\nof the personal Jesus as the last and most precious remnant of the\ndivinity which has vanished beyond the power of the imagination\ncorresponds to this tendency.",
    "In this respect the Roman Catholic Church\nwas more practical, because she met the general need of the visible, or\nat least historically believed hero, through the fact that she placed\nupon the throne of worship a small but clearly perceptible god of the\nworld, namely, the Roman Pope, the Pater patrum, and at the same time\nthe Pontifex Maximus of the invisible upper or inner God.",
    "The sensuous\ndemonstrability of God naturally supports the religious process of\nintroversion, because the human figure essentially facilitates the\ntransference, for it is not easy to imagine something lovable or\nvenerable in a spiritual being.",
    "This tendency, everywhere present, has\nbeen secretly preserved in the rationalistic theology with its Jesus\nhistorically insisted upon.",
    "This does not mean that men loved the\nvisible God; they love him, not as he is, for he is merely a man, and\nwhen the pious wished to love humanity they could go to their neighbors\nand their enemies to love them.",
    "Mankind wishes to love in God only their\nideas, that is to say, the ideas which they project into God.",
    "By that\nthey wish to love their unconscious, that is, that remnant of ancient\nhumanity and the centuries-old past in all people, namely, the common\nproperty left behind from all development which is given to all men,\nlike the sunshine and the air.",
    "But in loving this inheritance they love\nthat which is common to all.",
    "Thus they turn back to the mother of\nhumanity, that is to say, to the spirit of the race, and regain in this\nway something of that connection and of that mysterious and irresistible\npower which is imparted by the feeling of belonging to the herd.",
    "It is\nthe problem of Antæus, who preserves his gigantic strength only through\ncontact with mother earth.",
    "This temporary withdrawal into one’s self,\nwhich, as we have already seen, signifies a regression to the childish\nbond to the parent, seems to act favorably, within certain limits, in\nits effect upon the psychologic condition of the individual.",
    "It is in\ngeneral to be expected that the two fundamental mechanisms of the\npsychoses, transference and introversion, are to a wide extent extremely\nappropriate methods of normal reaction against complexes; transference\nas a means of escaping from the complex into reality; introversion as a\nmeans of detaching one’s self from reality through the complex.",
    "After we have informed ourselves about the general purposes of prayer,\nwe are prepared to hear more about the vision of our dreamer.",
    "After the\nprayer, “the head of a sphinx with an Egyptian headdress” appeared, only\nto vanish quickly.",
    "Here the author was disturbed, so that for a moment\nshe awoke.",
    "This vision recalls the previously mentioned phantasy of the\nEgyptian statue, whose rigid gesture is entirely in place here as a\nphenomenon of the so-called functional category.",
    "The light stages of the\nhypnosis are designated technically as “Engourdissement” (stiffening).\n",
    "The word Sphinx in the whole civilized world signifies the same as\nriddle: a puzzling creature who proposes riddles, like the Sphinx of\nOedipus, standing at the portal of his fate like a symbolic proclamation\nof the inevitable.",
    "The Sphinx is a semi-theriomorphic representation of\nthat “mother image” which may be designated as the “terrible mother,” of\nwhom many traces are found in mythology.",
    "This interpretation is correct\nfor Oedipus.",
    "Here the question is opened.",
    "The objection will be raised\nthat nothing except the word “Sphinx” justifies the allusion to the\nSphinx of Oedipus.",
    "On account of the lack of subjective materials, which\nin the Miller text are wholly lacking in regard to this vision, an\nindividual interpretation would also be excluded.",
    "The suggestion of an\n“Egyptian” phantasy (Part I, Chapter II) is entirely insufficient to be\nemployed here.",
    "Therefore we are compelled, if we wish to venture at all\nupon an understanding of this vision, to direct ourselves—perhaps in all\ntoo daring a manner—to the available ethnographic material under the\nassumption that the unconscious of the present-day man coins its symbols\nas was done in the most remote past.",
    "The Sphinx, in its traditional\nform, is a half-human, half-animal creature, which we must, in part,\ninterpret in the way that is applicable to such phantastic products.",
    "The\nreader is directed to the deductions in the first part of this volume\nwhere the theriomorphic representations of the libido were discussed.\n",
    "This manner of representation is very familiar to the analyst, through\nthe dreams and phantasies of neurotics (and of normal men).",
    "The impulse\nis readily represented as an animal, as a bull, horse, dog, etc.",
    "One of\nmy patients, who had questionable relations with women, and who began\nthe treatment with the fear, so to speak, that I would surely forbid him\nhis sexual adventures, dreamed that I (his physician) very skilfully\nspeared to the wall a strange animal, half pig, half crocodile.",
    "Dreams\nswarm with such theriomorphic representations of the libido.",
    "Mixed\nbeings, such as are in this dream, are not rare.",
    "A series of very\nbeautiful illustrations, where especially the lower half of the animal\nwas represented theriomorphically, has been furnished by\nBertschinger.[350]",
    "The libido which was represented theriomorphically is\nthe “animal” sexuality which is in a repressed state.",
    "The history of\nrepression, as we have seen, goes back to the incest problem, where the\nfirst motives for moral resistance against sexuality display themselves.\n",
    "The objects of the repressed libido are, in the last degree, the images\nof father and mother; therefore the theriomorphic symbols, in so far as\nthey do not symbolize merely the libido in general, have a tendency to\npresent father and mother (for example, father represented by a bull,\nmother by a cow).",
    "From these roots, as we pointed out earlier, might\nprobably arise the theriomorphic attributes of the Divinity.",
    "In as far\nas the repressed libido manifests itself under certain conditions, as\nanxiety, these animals are generally of a horrible nature.",
    "In\nconsciousness we are attached by all sacred bonds to the mother; in the\ndream she pursues us as a terrible animal.",
    "The Sphinx, mythologically\nconsidered, is actually a fear animal, which reveals distinct traits of\na mother derivate.",
    "In the Oedipus legend the Sphinx is sent by Hera, who\nhates Thebes on account of the birth of Bacchus; because Oedipus\nconquers the Sphinx, which is nothing but fear of the mother, he must\nmarry Jocasta, his mother, for the throne and the hand of the widowed\nqueen of Thebes belonged to him who freed the land from the plague of\nthe Sphinx.",
    "The genealogy of the Sphinx is rich in allusions to the\nproblem touched upon here.",
    "She is a daughter of Echnida, a mixed being;\na beautiful maiden above, a hideous serpent below.",
    "This double creature\ncorresponds to the picture of the mother; above, the human, lovely and\nattractive half; below, the horrible animal half, converted into a fear\nanimal through the incest prohibition.",
    "Echnida is derived from the\nAll-mother, the mother Earth, Gaea, who, with Tartaros, the personified\nunderworld (the place of horrors), brought her forth.",
    "Echnida herself is\nthe mother of all terrors, of the Chimaera, Scylla, Gorgo, of the\nhorrible Cerberus, of the Nemean Lion, and of the eagle who devoured the\nliver of Prometheus; besides this she gave birth to a number of dragons.\n",
    "One of her sons is Orthrus, the dog of the monstrous Geryon, who was\nkilled by Hercules.",
    "With this dog, her son, Echnida, in incestuous\nintercourse, produced the Sphinx.",
    "These materials will suffice to\ncharacterize that amount of libido which led to the Sphinx symbol.",
    "If,\nin spite of the lack of subjective material, we may venture to draw an\ninference from the Sphinx symbol of our author, we must say that the\nSphinx represents an original incestuous amount of libido detached from\nthe bond to the mother.",
    "Perhaps it is better to postpone this conclusion\nuntil we have examined the following visions.",
    "After Miss Miller had concentrated herself again, the vision developed\nfurther:",
    "“Suddenly an Aztec appeared, absolutely clear in every detail; the\n  hands spread open, with large fingers, the head in profile, armored,\n  headdress similar to the feather ornaments of the American Indian.",
    "The\n  whole was somewhat suggestive of Mexican sculpture.”",
    "The ancient Egyptian character of the Sphinx is replaced here by\nAmerican antiquity—by the Aztec.",
    "The essential idea is neither Egypt nor\nMexico, for the two could not be interchanged; but it is the subjective\nfactor which the dreamer produces from her own past.",
    "I have frequently\nobserved in the analysis of Americans that certain unconscious\ncomplexes, i.e. repressed sexuality, are represented by the symbol of a\nNegro or an Indian; for example, when a European tells in his dream,\n“Then came a ragged, dirty individual,” for Americans and for those who\nlive in the tropics it is a Negro.",
    "When with Europeans it is a vagabond\nor a criminal, with Americans it is a Negro or an Indian which\nrepresents the individual’s own repressed sexual personality, and the\none considered inferior.",
    "It is also desirable to go into the particulars\nof this vision, as there are various things worthy of notice.",
    "The\nfeather cap, which naturally had to consist of eagles’ feathers, is a\nsort of magic charm.",
    "The hero assumes at the same time something of the\nsun-like character of this bird when he adorns himself with its\nfeathers, just as the courage and strength of the enemy are appropriated\nin swallowing his heart or taking his scalp.",
    "At the same time, the\nfeather crest is a crown which is equivalent to the rays of the sun.",
    "The\nhistorical importance of the Sun identification has been seen in the\nfirst part.[351]",
    "Especial interest attaches to the hand, which is described as “open,”\nand the fingers, which are described as “large.”",
    "It is significant that\nit is the hand upon which the distinct emphasis falls.",
    "One might rather\nhave expected a description of the facial expression.",
    "It is well known\nthat the gesture of the hand is significant; unfortunately, we know\nnothing about that here.",
    "Nevertheless, a parallel phantasy might be\nmentioned, which also puts the emphasis upon hands.",
    "A patient in a\nhypnagogic condition saw his mother painted on a wall, like a painting\nin a Byzantine church.",
    "She held one hand up, open wide, with fingers\nspread apart.",
    "The fingers were very large, swollen into knobs on the\nends, and each surrounded by a small halo.",
    "The immediate association\nwith this picture was the fingers of a frog with sucking discs at the\nends.",
    "Then the similarity to the penis.",
    "The ancient setting of this\nmother picture is also of importance.",
    "Evidently the hand had, in this\nphantasy, a phallic meaning.",
    "This interpretation was confirmed by a\nfurther very remarkable phantasy of the same patient.",
    "He saw something\nlike a “sky-rocket” ascending from his mother’s hand, which at a closer\nsurvey becomes a shining bird with golden wings, a golden pheasant, as\nit then occurs to his mind.",
    "We have seen in the previous chapter that\nthe hand has actually a phallic, generative meaning, and that this\nmeaning plays a great part in the production of fire.",
    "In connection with\nthis phantasy, there is but one observation to make: fire was bored with\nthe hand; therefore it comes from the hand; Agni, the fire, was\nworshipped as a golden-winged bird.[352]",
    "It is extremely significant\nthat it is the mother’s hand.",
    "I must deny myself the temptation to enter\nmore deeply into this.",
    "Let it be sufficient to have pointed out the\npossible significance of the hand of the Aztec by means of these\nparallel hand phantasies.",
    "We have mentioned the mother suggestively with\nthe Sphinx.",
    "The Aztec taking the place of the Sphinx points, through his\nsuggestive hand, to parallel phantasies in which the phallic hand really\nbelongs to the mother.",
    "Likewise we encounter an antique setting in\nparallel phantasies.",
    "The significance of the antique, which experience\nhas shown to be the symbol for “infantile,” is confirmed by Miss Miller\nin this connection in the annotation to her phantasies, for she says:",
    "“In my childhood, I took a special interest in the Aztec fragments and\n  in the history of Peru and of the Incas.”",
    "Through the two analyses of children which have been published we have\nattained an insight into the child’s small world, and have seen what\nburning interests and questions secretly surround the parents, and that\nthe parents are, for a long time, the objects of the greatest\ninterest.[353] We are, therefore, justified in suspecting that the\nantique setting applies to the “ancients,” that is to say, the parents,\nand that consequently this Aztec has something of the father or mother\nin himself.",
    "Up to this time indirect hints point only to the mother,\nwhich is nothing remarkable in an American girl, because Americans, as a\nresult of the extreme detachment from the father, are characterized by a\nmost enormous mother complex, which again is connected with the especial\nsocial position of woman in the United States.",
    "This position brings\nabout a special masculinity among capable women, which easily makes\npossible the symbolizing into a masculine figure.[354]",
    "After this vision, Miss Miller felt that a name formed itself “bit by\nbit,” which seemed to belong to this Aztec—“the son of an Inca of Peru.”\n",
    "The name is “Chi-wan-to-pel.”",
    "As the author intimated, something similar\nto this belonged to her childish reminiscences.",
    "The act of naming is,\nlike baptism, something exceedingly important for the creation of a\npersonality, because, since olden times, a magic power has been\nattributed to the name, with which, for example, the spirit of the dead\ncan be conjured.",
    "To know the name of any one means, in mythology, to\nhave power over that one.",
    "As a well-known example I mention the fairy\ntale of “Rumpelstilzchen.”",
    "In an Egyptian myth, Isis robs the Sun god Rê\npermanently of his power by compelling him to tell her his real name.\n",
    "Therefore, to give a name means to give power, invest with a definite\npersonality.[355]",
    "The author observed, in regard to the name itself,\nthat it reminded her very much of the impressive name Popocatepetl, a\nname which belongs to unforgettable school memories, and, to the\ngreatest indignation of the patient, very often emerges in an analysis\nin a dream or phantasy and brings with it that same old joke which one\nheard in school, told oneself and later again forgot.",
    "Although one might\nhesitate to consider this unhallowed joke as of psychologic importance,\nstill one must inquire for the reason of its being.",
    "One must also put,\nas a counter question, Why is it always Popocatepetl and not the\nneighboring Iztaccihuatl, or the even higher and just as clear Orizaba?\n",
    "The last has certainly the more beautiful and more easily pronounced\nname.",
    "Popocatepetl is impressive because of its onomatopoetic name.",
    "In\nEnglish the word is “to pop” (popgun), which is here considered as\nonomatopoesy; in German the words are _Hinterpommern_, _Pumpernickel_;\n",
    "_Bombe_; _Petarde_ (_le pet_ = flatus).",
    "The frequent German word _Popo_\n(Podex) does not indeed exist in English, but flatus is designated as\n“to poop” in childish speech.",
    "The act of defecation is often designated\nas “to pop.”",
    "A joking name for the posterior part is “the bum.”",
    "(Poop\nalso means the rear end of a ship.)",
    "In French, _pouf!_ is onomatopoetic;\n_pouffer_ = _platzen_ (to explode), _la poupe_",
    "= rear end of ship, _le\npoupard_",
    "= the baby in arms, _la poupée_ = doll.",
    "_",
    "Poupon_ is a pet name\nfor a chubby-faced child.",
    "In Dutch _pop_, German _",
    "Puppe_ and Latin\n_puppis_ = doll; in Plautus, however, it is also used jokingly for the\nposterior part of the body; _pupus_ means child; _pupula_ = girl, little\ndollie.",
    "The Greek word ποππύζω designates a cracking, snapping or\nblowing sound.",
    "It is used of kissing; by Theocritus also of the\nassociated noise of flute blowing.",
    "The etymologic parallels show a\nremarkable relationship between the part of the body in question and the\nchild.",
    "This relationship we will mention here, only to let it drop at\nonce, as this question will claim our attention later.",
    "One of my patients in his childhood had always connected the act of\ndefecation with a phantasy that his posterior was a volcano and a\nviolent eruption took place, explosion of gases and gushings forth of\nlava.",
    "The terms for the elemental occurrences of nature are originally\nnot at all poetical; one thinks, for example, of the beautiful\nphenomenon of the meteor, which the German language most unpoetically\ncalls “Sternschnuppe” (the smouldering wick of a star).",
    "Certain South\nAmerican Indians call the shooting star the “urine of the stars.”\n",
    "According to the principle of the least resistance, expressions are\ntaken from the nearest source available.",
    "(For example, the transference\nof the metonymic expression of urination as _Schiffens_, “to rain.”)",
    "Now it seems to be very obscure why the mystical figure of Chiwantopel,\nwhom Miss Miller, in a note, compares to the control spirit of the\nspiritualistic medium,[356] is found in such a disreputable neighborhood\nthat his nature (name) was brought into relation with this particular\npart of the body.",
    "In order to understand this possibility, we must\nrealize that when we produce from the unconscious the first to be\nbrought forth is the infantile material long lost in memory.",
    "One must,\ntherefore, take the point of view of that time in which this infantile\nmaterial was still on the surface.",
    "If now a much-honored object is\nrelated in the unconscious to the anus, then one must conclude that\nsomething of a high valuation was expressed thereby.",
    "The question is\nonly whether this corresponds to the psychology of the child.",
    "Before we\nenter upon this question, it must be stated that the anal region is very\nclosely connected with veneration.",
    "One thinks of the traditional fæces\nof the Great Mogul.",
    "An Oriental tale has the same to say of Christian\nknights, who anointed themselves with the excrement of the pope and\ncardinals in order to make themselves formidable.",
    "A patient who is\ncharacterized by a special veneration for her father had a phantasy that\nshe saw her father sitting upon the toilet in a dignified manner, and\npeople going past greeted him effusively.[357] The association of the\nanal relations by no means excludes high valuation or esteem, as is\nshown by these examples, and as is easily seen from the intimate\nconnection of fæces and gold.[358] Here the most worthless comes into\nthe closest relation with the most valuable.",
    "This also happens in\nreligious valuations.",
    "I discovered (at that time to my great\nastonishment) that a young patient, very religiously trained,\nrepresented in a dream the Crucified on the bottom of a blue-flowered\nchamber pot, namely, in the form of excrements.",
    "The contrast is so\nenormous that one must assume that the valuations of childhood must\nindeed be very different from ours.",
    "This is actually the truth.",
    "Children\nbring to the act of defecation and the products of this an esteem and\ninterest[359] which later on is possible only to the hypochondriac.",
    "We\ndo not comprehend this interest until we learn that the child very early\nconnects with it a theory of propagation.[360] The libido afflux\nprobably accounts for the enormous interest in this act.",
    "The child sees\nthat this is the way in which something is produced, in which something\ncomes out.",
    "The same child whom I reported in the little brochure “Über\nKonflikte der kindlichen Seele,” and who had a well-developed anal\ntheory of birth, like little Hans, whom Freud made known to us, later\ncontracted a habit of staying a long time on the toilet.",
    "Once the father\ngrew impatient, went to the toilet and called, “Do come out of there;\nwhat are you making?”",
    "Whereupon the answer came from within, “A little\nwagon and two ponies.”",
    "The child was making a little wagon and two\nponies, that is to say, things which at that time she especially wished\nfor.",
    "In this way one can make what one wishes, and the thing made is the\nthing wished for.",
    "The child wishes earnestly for a doll or, at heart,\nfor a real child.",
    "(That is, the child practised for his future\nbiological task, and in the way in which everything in general is\nproduced he made the doll[361] himself as representative of the child or\nof the thing wished for in general.[362])",
    "From a patient I have learned\na parallel phantasy of her childhood.",
    "In the toilet there was a crevice\nin the wall.",
    "She phantasied that from this crevice a fairy would come\nout and present her with everything for which she wished.",
    "The “locus” is\nknown to be the place of dreams where much was wished for and created\nwhich later would no longer be suspected of having this place of origin.\n",
    "A pathological phantasy in place here is told us by Lombroso,[363]\nconcerning two insane artists.",
    "Each of them considered himself God and\nthe ruler of the world.",
    "They created or produced the world by making it\ncome forth from the rectum, just as the egg of birds originates in the\negg canal.",
    "One of these two artists was endowed with a true artistic\nsense.",
    "He painted a picture in which he was just in the act of creation;\nthe world came forth from his anus; the membrum was in full erection; he\nwas naked, surrounded by women, and with all insignia of his power.",
    "The\nexcrement is in a certain sense the thing wished for, and on that\naccount it receives the corresponding valuation.",
    "When I first understood\nthis connection, an observation made long ago, and which disturbed me\ngreatly because I never rightly understood it, became clear to me.",
    "It\nconcerned an educated patient who, under very tragic circumstances, had\nto be separated from her husband and child, and was brought into the\ninsane asylum.",
    "She exhibited a typical apathy and slovenliness which was\nconsidered as affective mental deterioration.",
    "Even at that time I\ndoubted this deterioration, and was inclined to regard it as a secondary\nadjustment.",
    "I took especial pains to ascertain how I could discover the\nexistence of the affect in this case.",
    "Finally, after more than three\nhours’ hard work, I succeeded in finding a train of thought which\nsuddenly brought the patient into a completely adequate and therefore\nstrongly emotional state.",
    "At this moment the affective connection with\nher was completely reëstablished.",
    "That happened in the forenoon.",
    "When I\nreturned at the appointed time in the evening to the ward to see her she\nhad, for my reception, smeared herself from head to foot with excrement,\nand cried laughingly, “Do I please you so?”",
    "She had never done that\nbefore; it was plainly destined for me.",
    "The impression which I received\nwas one of a personal affront and, as a result of this, I was convinced\nfor years after of the affective deterioration of such cases.",
    "Now we\nunderstand this act as an infantile ceremony of welcome or a declaration\nof love.",
    "The origin of Chiwantopel, that is to say, an unconscious personality,\ntherefore means, in the sense of the previous explanation, “I make,\nproduce, invent him myself.”",
    "It is a sort of human creation or birth by\nthe anal route.",
    "The first people were made from excrement, potter’s\nearth, or clay.",
    "The Latin _lutum_, which really means “moistened earth,”\nalso has the transferred meaning of dirt.",
    "In Plautus it is even a term\nof abuse, something like “You scum.”",
    "The birth from the anus also\nreminds us of the motive of “throwing behind oneself.”",
    "A well-known\nexample is the oracular command, which Deucalion and Pyrrha, who were\nthe only survivors from the great flood, received.",
    "They were to throw\nbehind them the bones of the great mother.",
    "They then threw behind them\nstones, from which mankind sprang.",
    "According to a tradition, the Dactyli\nin a similar manner sprang from dust, which the nymph Anchiale threw\nbehind her.",
    "There is also humorous significance attached to the anal\nproducts.",
    "The excrements are often considered in popular humor as a\nmonument or memorial (which plays a special part in regard to the\ncriminal in the form of _grumus merdæ_); every one knows the humorous\nstory of the man who, led by the spirit through labyrinthian passages to\na hidden treasure, after he had shed all his pieces of clothing,\ndeposited excrement as a last guide post on his road.",
    "In a more distant\npast a sign of this kind possessed as great a significance as the dung\nof animals to indicate the direction taken.",
    "Simple monuments (“little\nstone figures”) have taken the place of this perishable mark.",
    "It is noteworthy that Miss Miller quotes another case, where a name\nsuddenly obtruded itself, parallel to the emerging into consciousness of\nChiwantopel, namely, A-ha-ma-ra-ma, with the feeling that it dealt with\nsomething Assyrian.[364]",
    "As a possible source of this, there occurred to\nher “Asurabama, who made cuneiform bricks,”[365] those imperishable\ndocuments made from clay: the monuments of the most ancient history.",
    "If\nit were not emphasized that the bricks are “cuneiform,” then it might\nmean ambiguously “wedged-shaped bricks,” which is more suggestive of our\ninterpretation than that of the author.",
    "Miss Miller remarks that besides the name “Asurabama” she also thought\nof “Ahasuerus” or “Ahasverus.”",
    "This phantasy leads to a very different\naspect of the problem of the unconscious personality.",
    "While the previous\nmaterials betrayed to us something of the infantile theory of creation,\nthis phantasy opens up a vista into the dynamics of the unconscious\ncreation of personality.",
    "Ahasver is, as is well known, the Wandering\nJew; he is characterized by endless and restless wanderings until the\nend of the world.",
    "The fact that the author has thought of this\nparticular name justifies us in following this trail.",
    "The legend of\nAhasver, the first literary traces of which belong to the thirteenth\ncentury, seems to be of Occidental origin, and belongs to those ideas\nwhich possess indestructible vital energy.",
    "The figure of the Wandering\nJew has undergone more literary elaboration than the figure of Faust,\nand nearly all of this work belongs to the last century.",
    "If the figure\nis not called Ahasver, still it is there under another name, perhaps as\nCount of St. Germain, the mysterious Rosicrucian, whose immortality was\nassured, and whose temporary residence (the land) was equally\nknown.[366]",
    "Although the stories about Ahasver cannot be traced back any\nearlier than the thirteenth century, the oral tradition can reach back\nconsiderably further, and it is not an impossibility that a bridge to\nthe Orient exists.",
    "There is the parallel figure of Chidr, or “al\nChadir,” the “ever-youthful Chidher” celebrated in song by Rueckert.",
    "The\nlegend is purely Islamitic.",
    "The peculiar feature, however, is that\nChidher is not only a saint, but in Sufic circles[367] rises even to\ndivine significance.",
    "In view of the severe monotheism of Islam, one is\ninclined to think of Chidher as a pre-Islamitic Arabian divinity who\nwould hardly be officially recognized by the new religion, but might\nhave been tolerated on political grounds.",
    "But there is nothing to prove\nthat.",
    "The first traces of Chidher are found in the commentaries of the\nKoran, Buchâri and Tabare and in a commentary to a noteworthy passage of\nthe eighteenth sura of the Koran.",
    "The eighteenth sura is entitled “the\ncave,” that is, after the cave of the seven sleepers, who, according to\nthe legend, slept there for 309 years, and thus escaped persecution, and\nawoke in a new era.",
    "Their legend is recounted in the eighteenth sura,\nand divers reflections were associated with it.",
    "The wish-fulfilment idea\nof the legend is very clear.",
    "The mystic material for it is the immutable\nmodel of the Sun’s course.",
    "The Sun sets periodically, but does not die.\n",
    "It hides in the womb of the sea or in a subterranean cave,[368] and in\nthe morning is “born again,” complete.",
    "The language in which this\nastronomic occurrence is clothed is one of clear symbolism; the Sun\nreturns into the mother’s womb, and after some time is again born.",
    "Of\ncourse, this event is properly an incestuous act, of which, in\nmythology, clear traces are still retained, not the least of which is\nthe circumstance that the dying and resurrected gods are the lovers of\ntheir own mothers or have generated themselves through their own\nmothers.",
    "Christ as the “God becoming flesh” has generated himself\nthrough Mary; Mithra has done the same.",
    "These Gods are unmistakable\nSun-gods, for the Sun also does this, in order to again renew himself.\n",
    "Naturally, it is not to be assumed that astronomy came first and these\nconceptions of gods afterwards; the process was, as always, inverted,\nand it is even true that primitive magic charms of rebirth, baptism,\nsuperstitious usages of all sorts, concerning the cure of the sick,\netc., were projected into the heavens.",
    "These youths were born from the\ncave (the womb of mother earth), like the Sun-gods, in a new era, and\nthis was the way they vanquished death.",
    "In this far they were immortal.\n",
    "It is now interesting to see how the Koran comes, after long ethical\ncontemplations in the course of the same sura, to the following passage,\nwhich is of especial significance for the origin of the Chidher myth.\n",
    "For this reason I quote the Koran literally:",
    "“Remember when Moses said to his servant, ‘I will not stop till I\n  reach the confluence of the two seas, or for eighty years will I\n  journey on.’",
    "“But when they reached their confluence they forgot their fish, and it\n  took its way in the sea at will.",
    "“And when they had passed on, Moses said to his servant, ‘Bring us our\n  morning meal, for now we have incurred weariness from this our\n  journey.’",
    "“He said, ‘What thinkest thou?",
    "When we repaired to the rock for rest,\n  then verily I forgot the fish; and none but Satan made me forget it,\n  so as not to mention it; and it hath taken its way in the sea in a\n  wondrous sort.’",
    "“He said, ‘It is this we were in quest of.’",
    "So they both went back\n  retracing their footsteps.",

    "If now we wish to know who is the unknown servant of God, we are told in\nthis passage _",
    "he is Dhulqarnein, Alexander, the Sun; he goes to the\nplace of setting and he goes to the place of rising_.",
    "The passage about\nthe unknown servant of God is explained by the commentaries in a\nwell-defined legend.",
    "The servant is Chidher, “the verdant one,” the\nnever-tiring wanderer, who roams for hundreds and thousands of years\nover lands and seas, the teacher and counsellor of pious men; the one\nwise in divine knowledge—the immortal.[371]",
    "The authority of the Tabari\nassociates Chidher with Dhulqarnein; Chidher is said to have reached the\n“stream of life” as a follower of Alexander, and both unwittingly had\ndrunk of it, so that they became immortal.",
    "Moreover, _Chidher is\nidentified by the old commentators with Elias_, who also did not die,\nbut _who was taken to Heaven in a fiery chariot_.",
    "Elias is\n_",
    "Helios_.[372]",
    "It is to be observed that Ahasver also owes his existence\nto an obscure place in the holy Christian scriptures.",
    "This place is to\nbe found in Matthew xvi:28.",
    "First comes the scene where Christ appoints\nPeter as the rock of his church, and nominates him the governor of his\npower.[373] After that follows the prophecy of his death, and then comes\nthe passage:",
    "“Verily, I say unto you, there be some standing here, which shall not\n  taste of death till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”",
    "Here follows the scene of the transfiguration:",
    "“And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,\n  and his raiment was white as the light.",
    "“And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.",
    "“Then answered Peter and said unto Jesus, ‘Lord, it is good for us to\n  be here; if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for\n  thee and one for Moses and one for Elias.",
    "’”[374]",
    "From these passages it appears that Christ stands on the same plane as\nElias, without being identified with him,[375] although the people\nconsider him as Elias.",
    "The ascension places Christ as identical with\nElias.",
    "The prophecy of Christ shows that there exist aside from himself\none or more immortals who shall not die until Parousai.",
    "According to\nJohn xxi: 22nd verse, the boy John was considered as one of these\nimmortals, and in the legend he is, in fact, not dead but merely\nsleeping in the ground until Parousai, and breathes so that the dust\nswirls round his grave.[376] As is evident, there are passable bridges\nfrom Christ by way of Elias to Chidher and Ahasuerus.",
    "It is said in an\naccount of this legend[377] that Dhulqarnein led his friend Chidher to\nthe “source of life” in order to have him drink of immortality.[378]\nAlexander also bathed in the stream of life and performed the ritual\nablutions.",
    "As I previously mentioned in a footnote, according to Matthew\nxvii: 12th verse, John the Baptist is Elias, therefore primarily\nidentical with Chidher.",
    "Now, however, it is to be noted that in the\nArabian legend Chidher appears rather as a companion or accompanied\n(Chidher with Dhulqarnein or with Elias, “like unto them”; or identified\nwith them[379]).",
    "There are therefore, two similar figures who resemble\neach other, but who, nevertheless, are distinct.",
    "The analogous situation\nin the Christian legend is found in the scene by the Jordan where John\nleads Christ to the “source of life.”",
    "Christ is there, the subordinate,\nJohn the superior, similar to Dhulqarnein and Chidher, or Chidher and\nMoses, also Elias.",
    "The latter relation especially is such that Vollers\ncompares Chidher and Elias, on the one side, with Gilgamesh and his\nmortal brother Eabani; on the other side, with the Dioscuri, one of whom\nis immortal, the other mortal.",
    "This relation is also found in Christ and\nJohn the Baptist,[380] on the one hand, and Christ and Peter, on the\nother.",
    "The last-named parallel only finds its explanation through\ncomparison with the Mithraic mysteries, where the esoteric contents are\nrevealed to us through monuments.",
    "Upon the Mithraic marble relief of\nKlagenfurt[381]",
    "it is represented how with a halo Mithra crowns Helios,\nwho either kneels before him or else floats up to him from below.",
    "Mithra\nis represented on a Mithraic monument of Osterburken as holding in his\nright hand the shoulder of the mystic ox above Helios, who stands bowed\ndown before him, the left hand resting on a sword hilt.",
    "A crown lies\nbetween them on the ground.",
    "Cumont observes about this scene that it\nprobably represents the divine prototype of the ceremony of the\ninitiation into the degree of Miles, in which a sword and a crown were\nconferred upon the mystic.",
    "Helios is, therefore, appointed the Miles of\nMithra.",
    "In a general way, Mithra seems to occupy the rôle of patron to\nHelios, which reminds us of the boldness of Hercules towards Helios.\n",
    "Upon his journey towards Geryon, Helios burns too hotly; Hercules, full\nof anger, threatens him with his never-failing arrows.",
    "Therefore, Helios\nis compelled to yield, and lends to the hero his Sun ship, with which he\nwas accustomed to journey across the sea.",
    "Thus Hercules returns to\nErythia, to the cattle herds of Geryon.[382] On the monument at\nKlagenfurt, Mithra is furthermore represented pressing Helios’s hand,\neither in farewell or as a ratification.",
    "In a further scene Mithra\nmounts the Chariot of Helios, either for the ascension or the “Sea\nJourney.",
    "”[383] Cumont is of the opinion that Mithra gives to Helios a\nsort of ceremonious investiture and consecrates him with his divine\npower by crowning him with his own hands.",
    "This relation corresponds to\nthat of Christ to Peter.",
    "Peter, through his symbol, the cock, has the\ncharacter of a sun-god.",
    "After the ascension (or sea journey) of Christ,\nhe is the visible pontiff of the divinity; he suffers, therefore, the\nsame death (crucifixion) as Christ, and becomes the great Roman deity\n(_Sol invictus_), the conquering, triumphant Church itself, embodied in\nthe Pope.",
    "In the scene of Malchus he is always shown as the miles of\nChrist, to whom the sword is granted, and as the rock upon which the\nChurch is founded.",
    "The crown[384] is also given to him who possesses the\npower to bind and to set free.",
    "Thus, Christ, like the Sun, is the\nvisible God, whereas the Pope, like the heir of the Roman Cæsars, is\n_solis invicti comes_.",
    "The setting sun appoints a successor whom he\ninvests with the power of the sun.[385] Dhulqarnein gives Chidher\neternal life.",
    "Chidher communicates his wisdom to Moses.[386] There even\nexists a report according to which the forgetful servant of Joshua\ndrinks from the well of life, whereupon he becomes immortal, and is\nplaced in a ship by Chidher and Moses, as a punishment, and is cast out\nto sea, once more a fragment of a sun myth, the motive of the “sea\njourney.",
    "”[387]",
    "The primitive symbol, which designates that portion of the Zodiac in\nwhich the Sun, with the Winter Solstice, again enters upon the yearly\ncourse, is the goat, fish sign, the αἰγωκέρως.",
    "The Sun mounts like a\ngoat to the highest mountain, and later goes into the water as a fish.\n",
    "The fish is the symbol of the child,[388] for the child before his birth\nlives in the water like a fish, and the Sun, because it plunges into the\nsea, becomes equally child and fish.",
    "The fish, however, is also a\nphallic symbol,[389] also a symbol for the woman.[390] Briefly stated,\nthe fish is a libido symbol, and, indeed, as it seems predominately _for\nthe renewal of the libido_.",
    "The journey of Moses with his servant is a life-journey (eighty years).\n",
    "They grow old and lose their life force (libido), that is, they lose the\nfish which “pursues its course in a marvellous manner to the sea,” which\nmeans the setting of the sun.",
    "When the two notice their loss, they\ndiscover at the place where the “source of life” is found (where the\ndead fish revived and sprang into the sea)",
    "Chidher wrapped in his\nmantle,[391] sitting on the ground.",
    "According to another version, he sat\non an island in the sea, or “in the wettest place on earth,” that is, he\nwas just _born from the maternal depths_.",
    "Where the fish vanished\nChidher, “the verdant one,” was born as a “son of the deep waters,” his\nhead veiled, a Cabir, a proclaimer of divine wisdom; the old Babylonian\nOannes-Ea, who was represented in the form of a fish, and daily came\nfrom the sea as a fish to teach the people wisdom.[392] His name was\nbrought into connection with John’s.",
    "With the rising of the renewed sun\nall that lived in darkness, as water-animal or fish, surrounded by all\nterrors of night and death,[393] became as the shining fiery firmament\nof the day.",
    "Thus the words of John the Baptist[394] gain especial\nmeaning:",
    "“I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh\n  after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he\n  shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”",
    "With Vollers we may also compare Chidher and Elias (Moses and his\nservant Joshua) with Gilgamesh and his brother Eabani.",
    "Gilgamesh\nwandered through the world, driven by anxiety and longing, to find\nimmortality.",
    "His path led him across the seas to the wise Utnapishtim\n(Noah), who knew how to cross the waters of death.",
    "There Gilgamesh had\nto dive down to the bottom of the sea for the magical herb which was to\nlead him back to the land of men.",
    "When he had come again to his native\nland a serpent stole the magic plant from him (the fish again slid into\nthe sea).",
    "But on the return from the land of the blessed an immortal\nmariner accompanied him, who, banished by a curse of Utnapishtim, was\nforbidden to return to the land of the blessed.",
    "Gilgamesh’s journey had\nlost its purpose on account of the loss of the magic herb; instead he is\naccompanied by an immortal, whose fate, indeed, we cannot learn from the\nfragments of the epic.",
    "This banished immortal is the model for Ahasver,\nas Jensen[395] aptly remarked.",
    "Again we encounter the motive of the Dioscuri, mortal and immortal,\nsetting and rising sun.",
    "This _motive is also represented as if projected\nfrom the hero_.",
    "The Sacrificium Mithriacum (the sacrifice of the bull) is in its\nreligious representation very often flanked by the two Dadophores,\nCautes and Cautopates, one with a raised and the other with a lowered\ntorch.",
    "They represent brothers who reveal their character through the\nsymbolic position of the torch.",
    "Cumont connects them, not without\nmeaning, with the sepulchral “erotes” who as genii with the reversed\ntorches have traditional meaning.",
    "The one is supposed to stand for death\nand the other for life.",
    "I cannot refrain from mentioning the similarity\nbetween the Sacrificium Mithriacum (where the sacrificed bull in the\ncentre is flanked on both sides by Dadophores) to the Christian\nsacrifice of the lamb (ram).",
    "The Crucified is also traditionally flanked\nby the two thieves, one of whom ascends to Paradise, while the other\ndescends to Hell.[396]",
    "The idea of the mortal and the immortal seems to\nhave passed also into the Christian worship.",
    "Semitic gods are often\nrepresented as flanked by two Paredroi; for example, Baal of Edessa,\naccompanied by Aziz and Monimoz (Baal as the Sun, accompanied by Mars\nand Mercury, as expressed in astronomical teachings).",
    "According to the\nChaldean view, the gods are grouped into triads.",
    "In this circle of ideas\nbelongs also the Trinity, the idea of the triune God, in which Christ\nmust be considered in his unity with the Father and the Holy Ghost.",
    "So,\ntoo, do the two thieves belong inwardly to Christ.",
    "The two Dadophores\nare, as Cumont points out, nothing but offshoots[397] from the chief\nfigure of Mithra, to whom belongs a mysterious threefold character.\n",
    "According to an account of Dionysus Areopagita, the magicians celebrated\na festival, “τοῦ τριπλασίου Μίθρου.",
    "”[398][399]",
    "An observation likewise\nreferring to the Trinity is made by Plutarch concerning Ormuzd: τρὶς\nἑαυτὸν αὐξήσας ἀπέστησε τοῦ ἡλίου.[400] The Trinity, as three different\nstates of the unity, is also a Christian thought.",
    "In the very first\nplace this suggests a sun myth.",
    "An observation by Macrobius 1:18 seems\nto lend support to this idea:",
    "“Hæ autem ætatum diversitates ad solem referuntur, ut parvulus\n  videatur hiemali solstitio, qualem Aegyptii proferunt ex adyto die\n  certa, ... æquinoctio vernali figura iuvenis ornatur.",
    "Postea statuitur\n  ætas ejus plenissima effigie barbæ solstitio æstivo ... exunde per\n  diminutiones veluti senescenti quarta forma deus figuratur.”[401][402]",
    "As Cumont observes, Cautes and Cautapates occasionally carry in their\nhands the head of a bull, and a scorpion.[403] Taurus and Scorpio are\nequinoctial signs, which clearly indicate that the sacrificial scene\nrefers primarily to the Sun cycle; the rising Sun, which sacrifices\nitself at the summer solstice, and the setting Sun.",
    "In the sacrificial\nscene the symbol of the rising and setting Sun was not easily\nrepresented; therefore, this idea was removed from the sacrificial\nimage.",
    "We have pointed out above that the Dioscuri represent a similar idea,\nalthough in a somewhat different form; the one sun is always mortal, the\nother immortal.",
    "As this entire sun mythology is merely a psychologic\nprojection to the heavens, the fundamental thesis probably is as\nfollows; just as man consists of a mortal and immortal part, so the sun\nis a pair of brothers,[404] one being mortal, the other immortal.",
    "This\nthought lies at the basis of all theology in general.",
    "Man is, indeed,\nmortal, but there are some who are immortal, or there is something in us\nwhich is immortal.",
    "Thus the gods, “a Chidher or a St. Germain,” are our\nimmortal part, which, though incomprehensible, dwells among us\nsomewhere.",
    "Comparison with the sun teaches us over and over again that the gods are\nlibido.",
    "It is that part of us which is immortal, since it represents\nthat bond through which we feel that in the race we are never\nextinguished.[405]",
    "It is life from the life of mankind.",
    "Its springs,\nwhich well up from the depths of the unconscious, come, as does our life\nin general, from the root of the whole of humanity, since we are indeed\nonly a twig broken off from the mother and transplanted.",
    "Since the divine in us is the libido,[406] we must not wonder that we\nhave taken along with us in our theology ancient representations from\nolden times, which give the triune figure to the God.",
    "We have taken this\nτριπλάσιον Θεόν[407] from the phallic symbolism, the originality of\nwhich may well be uncontested.[408]",
    "The male genitals are the basis for\nthis Trinity.",
    "It is an anatomical fact that one testicle is generally\nplaced somewhat higher than the other, and it is also a very old, but,\nnevertheless, still surviving, superstition that one testicle generates\na boy and the other a girl.[409]",
    "A late Babylonian bas-relief from\nLajard’s[410] collection seems to be in accordance with this view.",
    "In\nthe middle of the image stands an androgynous god (masculine and\nfeminine face[411]); upon the right, male side, is found a serpent, with\na sun halo round its head; upon the left, female side, there is also a\nserpent, with the moon above its head.",
    "Above the head of the god there\nare three stars.",
    "This ensemble would seem to confirm the Trinity[412] of\nthe representation.",
    "The Sun serpent at the right side is male; the\nserpent at the left side is female (signified by the moon).",
    "This image\npossesses a symbolic sexual suffix, which makes the sexual significance\nof the whole obtrusive.",
    "Upon the male side a rhomb is found—a favorite\nsymbol of the female genitals; upon the female side there is a wheel or\nfelly.",
    "A wheel always refers to the Sun, but the spokes are thickened\nand enlarged at the ends, which suggests phallic symbolism.",
    "It seems to\nbe a phallic wheel, which was not unknown in antiquity.",
    "There are\nobscene bas-reliefs where Cupid turns a wheel of nothing but\nphalli.[413]",
    "It is not only the serpent which suggests the phallic\nsignificance of the Sun; I quote one especially marked case, from an\nabundance of proof.",
    "In the antique collection at Verona I discovered a\nlate Roman mystic inscription in which are the following\nrepresentations:",
    "[Illustration]",
    "These symbols are easily read: Sun—Phallus, Moon—Vagina (Uterus).",
    "This\ninterpretation is confirmed by another figure of the same collection.\n",
    "There the same representation is found, only the vessel[414] is replaced\nby the figure of a woman.",
    "The impressions on coins, where in the middle\na palm is seen encoiled by a snake, flanked by two stones (testicles),\nor else in the middle a stone encircled by a snake; to the right a palm,\nto the left a shell (female genitals[415]), should be interpreted in a\nsimilar manner.",
    "In Lajard’s “Researches” (“The Cult of Venus”) there is\na coin of Perga, where Artemis of Perga is represented by a conical\nstone (phallic) flanked by a man (claimed to be Men) and by a female\nfigure (claimed to be Artemis).",
    "Men (the so-called Lunus) is found upon\nan Attic bas-relief apparently with the spear but fundamentally a\nsceptre with a phallic significance, flanked by Pan with a club\n(phallus) and a female figure.[416]",
    "The traditional representation of\nthe Crucified flanked by John and Mary is closely associated with this\ncircle of ideas, precisely as is the Crucified with the thieves.",
    "From\nthis we see how, beside the Sun, there emerges again and again the much\nmore primitive comparison of the libido with the phallus.",
    "An especial\ntrace still deserves mention here.",
    "The Dadophor Cautapates, who\nrepresents Mithra, is also represented with the cock[417] and the\npineapple.",
    "But these are the attributes of the Phrygian god Men, whose\ncult was widely diffused.",
    "Men was represented with Pileus,[418]",
    "the\npineapple and the cock, also in the form of a boy, just as the\nDadophores are boyish figures.",
    "(This last-named property relates them\nwith Men to the Cabiri.)",
    "Men has a very close connection with Attis, the\nson and lover of Cybele.",
    "In the time of the Roman Cæsars, Men and Attis\nwere entirely identified, as stated above.",
    "Attis also wears the Pileus\nlike Men, Mithra and the Dadophores.",
    "As the son and lover of his mother\nhe again leads us to the source of this religion-creating incest libido,\nnamely, to the mother.",
    "Incest leads logically to ceremonial castration\nin the Attic-Cybele cult, for the Hero, driven insane by his mother,\nmutilates himself.[419] I must at present forego entering more deeply\ninto this matter, because the incest problem is to be discussed at the\nclose.",
    "Let this suggestion suffice—that from different directions the\nanalysis of the libido symbolism always leads back again to the mother\nincest.",
    "Therefore, we may surmise that the longing of the libido raised\nto God (repressed into the unconscious) is a primitive, incestuous one\nwhich concerns the mother.",
    "Through renouncing the virility to the first\nbeloved, the mother, the feminine element becomes extremely predominant;\nhence the strongly androgynous character of the dying and resurrected\nRedeemer.",
    "That these heroes are nearly always wanderers[420] is a\npsychologically clear symbolism.",
    "The wandering is a representation of\nlonging,[421] of the ever-restless desire, which nowhere finds its\nobject, for, unknown to itself, it seeks the lost mother.",
    "The wandering\nassociation renders the Sun comparison easily intelligible; also, under\nthis aspect, the heroes always resemble the wandering Sun, which seems\nto justify the fact that the myth of the hero is a sun myth.",
    "But the\nmyth of the hero, however, is, as it appears to me, the myth of our own\nsuffering unconscious, which has an unquenchable longing for all the\ndeepest sources of our own being; for the body of the mother, and\nthrough it for communion with infinite life in the countless forms of\nexistence.",

    "The possession\nof the mystery cuts one off from intercourse with the rest of mankind.",
    "_\n",
    "For a very complete and smooth rapport with the surroundings is of great\nimportance for the management of the libido and the _possession of a\nsubjectively important secret generally creates a great disturbance_.",
    "It\nmay be said that the whole art of life shrinks to the one problem of how\nthe libido may be freed in the most harmless way possible.",
    "Therefore,\nthe neurotic derives special benefit in treatment when he can at last\nrid himself of his various secrets.",
    "The symbol of the crowd of people,\nchiefly the streaming and moving mass, is, as I have often seen,\nsubstituted for the great excitement in the unconscious, especially in\npersons who are outwardly calm.",
    "The vision of the “throng” develops further; horses emerge; a battle is\nfought.",
    "With Silberer, I might accept the significance of this vision as\nbelonging, first of all, in the “functional category,” because,\nfundamentally, the conception of the intermingling crowds is nothing but\nthe symbol of the present onrush of the mass of thought; likewise the\nbattle, and possibly the horses, which illustrate the movement.",
    "The\ndeeper significance of the appearance of the horses will be seen for the\nfirst time in the further course of our treatment of the mother\nsymbolism.",

    "“Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot; thou hast been\n  forgotten.”",
    "And:",
    "“How does it come to pass that the virtuous city has become an\n  harlot?”",
    "We come across a similar symbolism in the myth of Ogyges, the mythical\nking who rules in Egyptian Thebes and whose wife was appropriately named\nThebe.",
    "The Bœotian Thebes founded by Cadmus received on that account a\nsurname, “Ogygian.”",
    "This surname was also given to the great flood, as\nit was called “Ogygian” because it occurred under Ogyges.",
    "This\ncoincidence will be found later on to be hardly accidental.",
    "The fact\nthat the city and the wife of Ogyges bear the same name indicates that\nsomewhere a relation must exist between the city and the woman, which is\nnot difficult to understand, for the city is identical with the woman.\n",
    "We meet a similar idea in Hindoo lore where Indra appears as the husband\nof Urvara, but Urvara means “the fertile land.”",
    "In a similar way the\noccupancy of a country by the king was understood as marriage with the\nploughed land.",
    "Similar representations must have prevailed in Europe as\nwell.",
    "Princes had to guarantee, for example, a good harvest at their\naccession.",
    "The Swedish King Domaldi was actually killed on account of\nthe failure of the harvest (Ynglinga sâga 18).",
    "In the Rama sâga the hero\nRama marries Sîtâ, the furrow of the field.[424]",
    "To the same group of\nideas belongs the Chinese custom of the Emperor ploughing a furrow at\nhis ascension to the throne.",
    "This idea of the soil being feminine also\nembraces the idea of continual companionship with the woman, a physical\ncommunication.",
    "Shiva, the Phallic God, is, like Mahadeva and Parwati,\nmale and female.",
    "He has even given one-half of his body to his consort\nParwati as a dwelling place.[425] Inman[426] gives us a drawing of a\nPundite of Ardanari-Iswara; one-half of the god is masculine, the other\nhalf feminine, and the genitals are in continuous cohabitation.",
    "The\nmotive of continuous cohabitation is expressed in a well-known lingam\nsymbol, which is to be found everywhere in Indian temples; the base is a\nfemale symbol, and within that is the phallus.[427] The symbol\napproaches very closely the Grecian mystic phallic basket and chests.\n",
    "(Compare with this the Eleusinian mysteries.)",
    "The chest or box is here a\nfemale symbol, that is, the mother’s womb.",
    "This is a very well-known\nconception in the old mythologies.[428] The chest, basket or little\nbasket, with its precious contents, was thought of as floating on the\nwater; a remarkable inversion of the natural fact that the child floats\nin the amniotic fluid and that this is in the uterus.",
    "This inversion brings about a great advantage for sublimation, for it\ncreates enormous possibilities of application for the myth-weaving\nphantasy, that is to say, for the annexation to the sun cycle.",
    "The Sun\nfloats over the sea like an immortal god, which every evening is\nimmersed in the maternal water and is born again renewed in the morning.\n",
    "Frobenius says:",
    "“Perhaps in connection with the blood-red sunrise, the idea occurs\n  that here a birth takes place, the birth of a young son; the question\n  then arises inevitably, whence comes the paternity?",
    "How has the woman\n  become pregnant?",
    "And since this woman symbolizes the same idea as the\n  fish, which means the sea, (because we proceed from the assumption\n  that the Sun descends into the sea as well as arises from it) thus the\n  curious primitive answer is that this sea has previously swallowed the\n  old Sun.",
    "Consequently the resulting myth is, that the woman (sea) has\n  formerly devoured the Sun and now brings a new Sun into the world, and\n  thus she has become pregnant.”",
    "All these sea-going gods are sun symbols.",
    "They are enclosed in a chest\nor an ark for the “night journey on the sea” (Frobenius), often together\nwith a woman (again an inversion of the actual situation, but in support\nof the motive of continuous cohabitation, which we have met above).\n",
    "During the night journey on the sea the Sun-god is enclosed in the\nmother’s womb, oftentimes threatened by dangers of all kinds.",
    "Instead of\nmany individual examples, I will content myself with reproducing the\nscheme which Frobenius has constructed from numberless myths of this\nsort:",

    "To slip out_ _",
    "To open_ _",
    "To land_ _",
    "Sea journey_ _",
    "To set on\nfire or To cut off the heart_]",
    "Frobenius gives the following legend to illustrate this:",
    "“A hero is devoured by a water monster in the West (to devour).",
    "The\n  animal carries him within him to the East (sea journey).",
    "Meanwhile, he\n  kindles a fire in the belly of the monster (to set on fire) and since\n  he feels hungry he cuts off a piece of the hanging heart (to cut off\n  the heart).",
    "Soon after he notices that the fish glides upon the dry\n  land (to land); he immediately begins to cut open the animal from\n  within outwards (to open) then he slides out (to slip out).",
    "In the\n  fish’s belly, it had been so hot, that all his hair had fallen out\n  (heat-hair).",
    "The hero frequently frees all who were previously\n  devoured (to devour all) and all now slide out (slip out).”",
    "A very close parallel is Noah’s journey during the flood, in which all\nliving creatures die; only he and the life guarded by him are brought to\na new birth.",
    "In a Melapolynesian legend (Frobenius) it is told that the\nhero in the belly of the King Fish took his weapon and cut open the\nfish’s belly.",
    "“He slid out and saw a splendor, and he sat down and\nreflected.",
    "‘I wonder where I am,’ he said.",
    "Then the sun rose with a\nbound and turned from one side to the other.”",
    "The Sun has again slipped\nout.",
    "Frobenius mentions from the Ramayana the myth of the ape Hanuman,\nwho represents the Sun-hero.",
    "The sun in which Hanuman hurries through\nthe air throws a shadow upon the sea.",
    "The sea monster notices this and\nthrough this draws Hanuman toward itself; when the latter sees that the\nmonster is about to devour him, he stretches out his figure\nimmeasurably; the monster assumes the same gigantic proportions.",
    "As he\ndoes that Hanuman becomes as small as a thumb, slips into the great body\nof the monster and comes out on the other side.",
    "In another part of the\npoem it is said that he came out from the right ear of the monster (like\nRabelais’ Gargantua, who also was born from the mother’s ear).",
    "“Hanuman\nthereupon resumes his flight, and finds a new obstacle in another sea\nmonster, which is the mother of Rahus, the sun-devouring demon.",
    "The\nlatter draws Hanuman’s shadow[429] to her in the same way.",
    "Hanuman again\nhas recourse to the earlier stratagem, becomes small and slips into her\nbody, but hardly is he there than he grows to a gigantic mass, swells\nup, tears her, kills her, and in that way makes his escape.”",
    "Thus we understand why the Indian fire-bringer Mâtariçvan is called “the\none swelling in the mother”; the ark (little box, chest, cask, vessel,\netc.) is a symbol of the womb, just as is the sea, into which the Sun\nsinks for rebirth.",
    "From this circle of ideas we understand the\nmythologic statements about Ogyges; he it is who possesses the mother,\nthe City, who is united with the mother; therefore under him came the\ngreat flood, for it is a typical fragment of the sun myth that the hero,\nwhen united with the woman attained with difficulty, is exposed in a\ncask and thrown into the sea, and then lands for a new life on a distant\nshore.",
    "The middle part, the “night journey on the sea” in the ark, is\nlacking in the tradition of Ogyges.[430] But the rule in mythology is\nthat the typical parts of a myth can be united in all conceivable\nvariations, which adds greatly to the extraordinary difficulty of the\ninterpretation of a particular myth without knowledge of all the others.\n",
    "The meaning of this cycle of myths mentioned here is clear; it is the\nlonging _to attain rebirth through the return to the mother’s womb, that\nis to say, to become as immortal as the sun_.",
    "This longing for the\nmother is frequently expressed in our holy scriptures.[431] I recall,\nparticularly the place in the epistle to the Galatians, where it is said\n(iv:26):",
    "(26)",
    "“But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us\n  all.",
    "(27) “For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that beareth not: break\n  forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many\n  more children than she which hath an husband.",
    "(28) “Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.",
    "(29)",
    "“But as he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was\n  born after the spirit, even so it is now.",
    "(30) “Nevertheless, what sayeth the scripture?",
    "Cast out the bondwoman\n  and her son; for the son of a bondwoman shall not be heir with the son\n  of a freewoman.",
    "(31) “So, then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of\n  the free.”",
    "Chapter v:",
    "(1) “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us\n  free.”",
    "The Christians are the children of the City Above, a symbol of the\nmother, not sons of the earthly city-mother, who is to be cast out; for\nthose born after the flesh are opposed to those born after the spirit,\nwho are not born from the mother in the flesh, but from a symbol for the\nmother.",
    "One must again think of the Indians at this point, who say the\nfirst people proceeded from the sword-hilt and a shuttle.",
    "The religious\nthought is bound up with the compulsion to call the mother no longer\nmother, but City, Source, Sea, etc.",
    "This compulsion can be derived from\nthe need to manifest an amount of libido bound up with the mother, but\nin such a way that the mother is represented by or concealed in a\nsymbol.",
    "The symbolism of the city we find well-developed in the\nrevelations of John, where two cities play a great part, one of which is\ninsulted and cursed by him, the other greatly desired.",
    "We read in\nRevelation (xvii:1):",
    "(1) “Come hither: I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great\n  whore that sitteth on many waters.",
    "(2) “With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and\n  the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her\n  fornication.",
    "(3) “So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I\n  saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of the names of\n  blasphemy, and having seven heads and ten horns.",
    "(4) “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colors, and\n  decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden\n  cup[432] in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her\n  fornication.",

    "(6) “And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of saints, and with\n  the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her I wondered with\n  a great admiration.”",
    "Here follows an interpretation of the vision unintelligible to us, from\nwhich we can only emphasize the point that the seven heads[433] of the\ndragon means the seven hills upon which the woman sits.",
    "This is probably\na distinct allusion to Rome, the city whose temporal power oppressed the\nworld at the time of the Revelation.",
    "The waters upon which the woman\n“the mother” sits are “peoples and throngs and nations and tongues.”\n",
    "This also seems to refer to Rome, for she is the mother of peoples and\npossessed all lands.",
    "Just as in common speech, for example, colonies are\ncalled daughters, so the people subject to Rome are like members of a\nfamily subject to the mother.",
    "In another version of the picture, the\nkings of the people, namely, the fathers, commit fornication with this\nmother.",
    "Revelation continues (xviii: 2):",
    "(2) “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the\n  Great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,\n  and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and\n  hateful bird.",
    "(3) “For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her\n  fornication.”",
    "Thus this mother does not only become the mother of all abominations,\nbut also in truth the receptacle of all that is wicked and unclean.",
    "The\nbirds are images of souls;[434] therefore, this means all souls of the\ncondemned and evil spirits.",
    "Thus the mother becomes Hecate, the\nunderworld, the City of the damned itself.",
    "We recognize easily in the\nancient idea of the woman on the dragon,[435] the above-mentioned\nrepresentation of Echnida, the mother of the infernal horrors.",
    "Babylon\nis the idea of the “terrible” mother, who seduces all people to whoredom\nwith devilish temptation, and makes them drunk with her wine.",
    "The\nintoxicating drink stands in the closest relation to fornication, for it\nis also a libido symbol, as we have already seen in the parallel of fire\nand sun.",
    "After the fall and curse of Babylon, we find in Revelation\n(xix:6–7) the hymn which leads from the under half to the upper half of\nthe mother, where now everything is possible which would be impossible\nwithout the repression of incest:",
    "(6) “Alleluia, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.",

    "(10) “And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high\n  mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,\n  descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.”",
    "It is evident from this quotation, after all that goes before, that the\nCity, the heavenly bride, who is here promised to the Son, is the\nmother.[438] In Babylon the impure maid was cast out, according to the\nEpistle to the Galatians, so that here in heavenly Jerusalem the\nmother-bride may be attained the more surely.",
    "It bears witness to the\nmost delicate psychologic perception that the fathers of the church who\nformulated the canons preserved this bit of the symbolic significance of\nthe Christ mystery.",

    "This dream idea may\neasily be understood by means of the antique or poetic symbolism, so I\ncan spare information as to the analytic material.",
    "The double significance of the tree is readily explained by the fact\nthat such symbols are not to be understood “anatomically” but\npsychologically as libido symbols; therefore, it is not permissible to\ninterpret the tree on account of its similar form as directly phallic;\nit can also be called a woman or the uterus of the mother.",
    "The\nuniformity of the significance lies alone in the similarity to the\nlibido.[451] One loses one’s way in one “cul de sac” after another by\nsaying that this is the symbol substituted for the mother and that for\nthe penis.",
    "In this realm there is no fixed significance of things.",

    "Whenever we read,\ntherefore, “his mother was a wicked sorcerer,” the translation is as\nfollows: The son is in love with her, namely, he is unable to detach his\nlibido from the mother-imago; he therefore suffers from incestuous\nresistance.",
    "The symbolism of water and trees, which are met with as further\nattributes in the symbol of the City, also refer to that amount of\nlibido which unconsciously is fastened to the mother-imago.",
    "In certain\nparts of Revelation the unconscious psychology of religious longing is\nrevealed, namely, the longing for the _mother_.[452] The expectation of\nRevelation ends in the mother: καὶ πᾶν κατάθεμα οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι (“and\nthere shall be no more curse”).",

    "I\nmust leave open for the present the definition of the psychological\nincest conception.",
    "However, I will here emphasize the point that it is\nmost especially the totality of the sun myth which proves to us that the\nfundamental basis of the “incestuous” desire does not aim at\ncohabitation, but at the special thought of becoming a child again, of\nturning back to the parent’s protection, of coming into the mother once\nmore in order to be born again.",
    "But incest stands in the path to this\ngoal, that is to say, the necessity of in some way again gaining\nentrance into the mother’s womb.",
    "One of the simplest ways would be to\nimpregnate the mother, and to reproduce one’s self identically.",
    "But here\nthe incest prohibition interferes; therefore, the myths of the sun or of\nrebirth teem with all possible proposals as to how incest can be evaded.\n",
    "A very simple method of avoidance is to transform the mother into\nanother being or to rejuvenate[453] her after birth has occurred, to\nhave her disappear again or have her change back.",
    "It is not incestuous\ncohabitation which is desired, but the rebirth, which now is attained\nmost readily through cohabitation.",
    "But this is not the only way,\nalthough perhaps the original one.",
    "The resistance to the incest\nprohibition makes the phantasy inventive; for example, it was attempted\nto impregnate the mother by means of a magic charm of fertility (to wish\nfor a child).",
    "Attempts in this respect remain in the stage of mythical\nphantasies; but they have one result, and that is the exercise of the\nphantasy which gradually produces paths through the creation of\nphantastic possibilities, in which the libido, taking an active part,\ncan flow off.",
    "Thus the libido becomes _spiritualized in an imperceptible\nmanner_.",
    "The power “which always wishes evil” thus creates a spiritual\nlife.",
    "Therefore, in religions, this course is now raised to a system.",
    "On\nthat account it is exceedingly instructive to see how religion takes\npains to further these symbolic transferences.[454]",
    "The New Testament\nfurnishes us with an excellent example in regard to this.",
    "Nicodemus, in\nthe speech regarding rebirth, cannot forbear understanding the matter\nvery realistically.",

    "John_ iii:4:",
    "(4) “How can a man be born when he is old?",
    "Can he enter a second time\n  into his mother’s womb, and be born?”",
    "But Jesus endeavors to raise into purity the sensuous view of\nNicodemus’s mind moulded in materialistic heaviness, and announces to\nhim—really the same—and yet not the same:",
    "(5) “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water\n  and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",
    "(6) “That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born\n  of the spirit is spirit.",
    "(7) “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.",
    "(8) “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound\n  thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth; so\n  is everyone that is born of the spirit.”",
    "To be born of water means simply to be born from the mother’s womb.",
    "To\nbe born of the spirit means to be born from the fructifying breath of\nthe wind; this we learn from the Greek text (where spirit and wind are\nexpressed by the same word, πνεῦμα)",
    "τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκος σάρξ\nἐστιν, καὶ τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ πνεύματος πνεῦμά ἐστιν.—Τὸ πνεῦμα ὅπου\nθέλει πνεῖ,[455] etc.",
    "This symbolism rose from the same need as that which produced the\nEgyptian legend of the vultures, the mother symbol.",
    "They were only\nfemales and were fertilized by the wind.",
    "One recognizes very clearly the\nethical demand as the foundation of these mythologic assertions: _thou\nmust say of the mother that she was not impregnated by a mortal in the\nordinary way, but by a spiritual being in an unusual manner_.",
    "This\ndemand stands in strict opposition to the real truth; therefore, the\nmyth is a fitting solution.",
    "One can say it was a hero who died and was\nborn again in a remarkable manner, and in this way attained immortality.\n",
    "The need which this demand asserts is evidently a prohibition against a\ndefinite phantasy concerning the mother.",
    "A son may naturally think that\na father has generated him in a carnal way, but not that he himself\nimpregnated the mother and so caused himself to be born again into\nrenewed youth.",
    "This incestuous phantasy which for some reason possesses\nan extraordinary strength,[456] and, therefore, appears as a compulsory\nwish, is repressed and, conforming to the above demand, under certain\nconditions, expresses itself again, symbolically, concerning the problem\nof birth, or rather concerning individual rebirth from the mother.",
    "In\nJesus’s challenge to Nicodemus we clearly recognize this tendency:\n“Think not carnally or thou art carnal, but think symbolically, then art\nthou spirit.”",
    "It is evident how extremely educative and developing this\ncompulsion toward symbolism can be.",
    "Nicodemus would remain fixed in low\ncommonplaces if he did not succeed in raising himself through symbols\nabove this repressed incestuous desire.",
    "As a righteous philistine of\nculture, he probably was not very anxious for this effort, because men\nseem really to remain satisfied in repressing the incestuous libido, and\nat best to express it by some modest religious exercises.",
    "Yet it seems\nto be important, on the other side, that man should not merely renounce\nand repress and thereby remain firmly fixed in the incestuous bond, but\nthat he should redeem those dynamic forces which lie bound up in incest,\nin order to fulfil himself.",
    "For man needs his whole libido, to fill out\nthe boundaries of his personality, and then, for the first time, he is\nin a condition to do his best.",
    "The paths by which man may manifest his\nincestuously fixed libido seem to have been pointed out by the religious\nmythologic symbols.",
    "On this account Jesus teaches Nicodemus: “Thou\nthinkest of thy incestuous wish for rebirth, but thou must think that\nthou art born from the water and that thou art generated by the breath\nof the wind,[457] and in this way thou shalt share in eternal life.”",
    "Thus the libido which lies inactive in the incestuous bond repressed and\nin fear of the law and the avenging Father God can be led over into\nsublimation through the symbol of baptism (birth from water) and of\ngeneration (spiritual birth) through the symbol of the descent of the\nHoly Ghost.",
    "Thus man becomes a child[458] again and is born into a\ncircle of brothers and sisters; but his mother is the “communion of the\nsaints,” the church, and his circle of brothers and sisters is humanity,\nwith whom he is united anew in the common inheritance of the primitive\nsymbol.",
    "It seems that at the time in which Christianity had its origin this\nprocess was especially necessary; for that period, as the result of the\nincredible contrast between slavery and the freedom of the citizens and\nmasters, had entirely lost the consciousness of the common bond of\nmankind.",
    "One of the next and most essential reasons for the energetic\nregression to the infantile in Christianity, which goes hand in hand\nwith the revival of the incest problem, was probably to be found in the\nfar-reaching depreciation of women.",
    "At that time sexuality was so easily\nattainable that the result could only be a very excessive depreciation\nof the sexual object.",
    "The existence of personal values was first\ndiscovered by Christianity, and there are many people who have not\ndiscovered it even in the present day.",
    "However, the depreciation of the\nsexual object hinders the outflow of that libido which cannot be\nsatisfied by sexual activity, because it belongs to an already\ndesexualized higher order.",
    "(If it were not so, a Don Juan could never be\nneurotic; but the contrary is the case.)",
    "For how might those higher\nvaluations be given to a worthless, despised object?",
    "Therefore, the\nlibido, after having seen a “Helen in every woman” for so long a time,\nsets out on a search for the difficult to obtain, the worshipped, but\nperhaps unattainable, goal, and which in the unconscious is the mother.\n",
    "Therefore the symbolic needs, based on the incest resistance, arise\nagain in an increased degree, which promptly transforms the beautiful,\nsinful world of the Olympian Gods into incomprehensible, dreamlike, dark\nmysteries, which, with their accessions of symbols and obscure\nmeaningful texts, remove us very far from the religious feelings of that\nRoman-Græco world.",
    "When we see how much trouble Jesus took to make\nacceptable to Nicodemus the symbolic perception of things, that is to\nsay, really a repression and veiling over of the actual facts, and how\nimportant it was for the history of civilization in general, that people\nthought and still think in this way, then we understand the revolt which\nis raised everywhere against the psychologic discovery of the true\nbackground of the neurotic or normal symbolism.",
    "Always and everywhere we\nencounter the odious realm of sexuality, which represents to all\nrighteous people of to-day something defiled.",
    "However, less than 2,000\nyears have passed since the religious cult of sexuality was more or less\nopenly in full bloom.",
    "To be sure, they were heathen and did not know\nbetter, but the nature of religious power does not change from cycle to\ncycle.",
    "If one has once received an effectual impression of the sexual\ncontents of the ancient cults, and if one realizes oneself that the\nreligious experience, that is, the union[459] with the God of antiquity,\nwas understood by antiquity as a more or less concrete coitus, then\ntruly one can no longer fancy that the motor forces of a religion have\nsuddenly become wholly different since the birth of Christ.",
    "Exactly the\nsame thing has occurred as with the hysteric who at first indulges in\nsome quite unbeautiful, infantile sexual manifestations and afterwards\ndevelops a hyperæsthetic negation in order to convince every one of his\nspecial purity.",
    "_",
    "Christianity, with its repression of the manifest\nsexual, is the negative of the ancient sexual cult._",
    "The original cult\nhas changed its tokens.[460]",
    "One only needs to realize how much of the\ngay paganism, even to the inclusion of unseemly Gods, has been taken\ninto the Christian church.",

    "Kosma and Damien, who graciously condescended to accept\nthe “membra virilia” in wax at their festival.[462] St. Phallus of old\nmemories emerges again to be worshipped in country chapels, to say\nnothing of the rest of the paganism!",
    "There are those who have not yet learned to recognize sexuality as a\nfunction equivalent to hunger and who, therefore, consider it as\ndisgraceful that certain taboo institutions which were considered as\nasexual refuges are now recognized as overflowing with sexual symbolism.\n",
    "Those people are doomed to the painful realization that such is still\nthe case, in spite of their great revolt.",
    "One must learn to understand\nthat, opposed to the customary habit of thought, psychoanalytic thinking\nreduces and resolves those symbolic structures which have become more\nand more complicated through countless elaboration.",
    "This means a course\nof reduction which would be an intellectual enjoyment if the object were\ndifferent.",
    "But here it becomes distressing, not only æsthetically, but\napparently also ethically, because the repressions which are to be\novercome have been brought about by our best intentions.",
    "We must\ncommence to overcome our virtuousness with the certain fear of falling\ninto baseness on the other side.",
    "This is certainly true, for\nvirtuousness is always inwardly compensated by a great tendency towards\nbaseness; and how many profligates are there who inwardly preserve a\nmawkish virtue and moral megalomania?",
    "Both categories of men turn out to\nbe snobs when they come in contact with analytic psychology, because the\nmoral man has imagined an objective and cheap verdict on sexuality and\nthe unmoral man is entirely unaware of the vulgarity of his sexuality\nand of his incapacity for an unselfish love.",
    "One completely forgets that\none can most miserably be carried away, not only by a vice, but also by\na virtue.",
    "There is a fanatic orgiastic self-righteousness which is just\nas base and which entails just as much injustice and violence as a vice.",
    "At this time, when a large part of mankind is beginning to discard\nChristianity, it is worth while to understand clearly why it was\noriginally accepted.",
    "It was accepted in order to escape at last from the\nbrutality of antiquity.",
    "As soon as we discard it, licentiousness\nreturns, as impressively exemplified by life in our large modern cities.\n",
    "This step is not a forward step, but a backward one.",
    "It is as with\nindividuals who have laid aside one form of transference and have no new\none.",
    "Without fail they will occupy regressively the old path of\ntransference, to their great detriment, because the world around them\nhas since then essentially changed.",
    "He who is repelled by the historical\nand philosophical weakness of the Christian dogmatism and the religious\nemptiness of an historical Jesus, of whose person we know nothing and\nwhose religious value is partly Talmudic, partly Hellenic wisdom, and\ndiscards Christianity, and therewith Christian morality, is certainly\nconfronted with the ancient problem of licentiousness.",
    "To-day the\nindividual still feels himself restrained by the public hypocritical\nopinion, and, therefore, prefers to lead a secret, separate life, but\npublicly to represent morality.",
    "It might be different if men in general\nall at once found the moral mask too dull, and if they realized how\ndangerously their beasts lie in wait for each other, and then truly a\nfrenzy of demoralization might sweep over humanity.",
    "This is the dream,\nthe wish dream, of the morally limited man of to-day; he forgets\nnecessity, which strangles men and robs them of their breath, and which\nwith a stern hand interrupts every passion.",
    "It must not be imputed to me that I am wishing to refer the libido back\nby analytical reduction to the primitive, almost conquered, stages,\nentirely forgetting the fearful misery this would entail for humanity.\n",
    "Indeed, some individuals would let themselves be transported by the\nold-time frenzy of sexuality, from which the burden of guilt has been\nremoved, to their own greatest detriment.",
    "But these are the ones who under other circumstances would have\nprematurely perished in some other way.",
    "However, I well know the most\neffectual and most inexorable regulator of human sexuality.",

    "With this leaden weight human lust will never fly too high.",
    "To-day there are countless neurotics who are so simply because they do\nnot know how to seek happiness in their own manner.",
    "They do not even\nrealize where the lack lies.",
    "And besides these neurotics there are many\nmore normal people—and precisely people of the higher type—who feel\nrestricted and discontented.",
    "For all these reduction to the sexual\nelements should be undertaken, in order that they may be reinstated into\nthe possession of their primitive self, and thereby learn to know and\nvalue its relation to the entire personality.",
    "In this way alone can\ncertain requirements be fulfilled and others be repudiated as unfit\nbecause of their infantile character.",
    "In this way the individual will\ncome to realize that certain things are to be sacrificed, although they\nare accomplished, _but in another sphere_.",
    "We imagine that we have long\nrenounced, sacrificed and cut off our incest wish, and that nothing of\nit is left.",
    "But it does not occur to us that this is not true, but that\nwe unconsciously commit incest in another territory.",
    "In religious\nsymbols, for example, we come across incest.[463] We consider the\nincestuous wish vanished and lost, and then rediscover it in full force\nin religion.",
    "This process or transformation has taken place\nunconsciously in secular development.",
    "Just as in Part I it is shown that\na similar unconscious transformation of the libido is an ethically\nworthless pose, and with which I compared the Christianity of early\nRoman antiquity, where evidently licentiousness and brutality were\nstrongly resisted, so here I must remark in regard to the sublimation of\nthe incestuous libido, that the belief in the religious symbol has\nceased to be an ethical ideal; but it is an unconscious transformation\nof the incest wish into symbolic acts and symbolic concepts which cheat\nmen, as it were, so that heaven appears to them as a father and earth as\na mother and the people upon it children and brothers and sisters.",
    "Thus\nman can remain a child for all time and satisfy his incest wish all\nunawares.",

    "The symbol, considered from\nthe standpoint of actual truth, is misleading, indeed, but it is\n_psychologically true_,[466] because it was and is the bridge to all the\ngreatest achievements of humanity.",
    "But this does not mean to say that this unconscious way of\ntransformation of the incest wish into religious exercises is the only\none or the only possible one.",
    "There is also a conscious recognition and\nunderstanding with which we can take possession of this libido which is\nbound up in incest and transformed into religious exercises so that we\nno longer need the stage of religious symbolism for this end.",
    "It is\nthinkable that instead of doing good to our fellow-men, for “the love of\nChrist,” we do it from the knowledge that humanity, even as ourselves,\ncould not exist if, among the herd, the one could not sacrifice himself\nfor the other.",

    "The\nhanging of the Attis image on the pine tree; the hanging of Marsyas,\nwhich became a celebrated artistic motive; the hanging of Odin; the\nGermanic hanging sacrifices—indeed, the whole series of hanged\ngods—teaches us that the hanging of Christ on the cross is not a unique\noccurrence in religious mythology, but belongs to the same circle of\nideas as others.",

    "Persia was\nfamiliar with the custom of leading a dog to the bed of one dying,\nwhereupon the latter had to present the dog with a morsel.[478] The\ncustom, on its surface, evidently signifies that the morsel is to belong\nto the dog, so that he will spare the body of the dead, precisely as\nCerberus was soothed by the honey-cakes which Hercules gave to him in\nthe journey to hell.",
    "But when we bear in mind the jackal-headed Anubis\nwho rendered his good services in the gathering together of the\ndismembered Osiris, and the mother significance of the vulture, then the\nquestion arises whether something deeper was not meant by this ceremony.\n",
    "Creuzer has also concerned himself with this idea, and has come to the\nconclusion that the astral form of the dog ceremony, that is, the\nappearance of Sirius, the dog star, at the period of the sun’s highest\nposition, is related to this in that the introduction of the dog has a\ncompensatory significance, death being thereby made, reversedly, equal\nto the sun’s highest position.",
    "This is quite in conformity with\npsychologic thought, which results from the very general fact that death\nis interpreted as entrance into the mother’s womb (rebirth).",

    "Upon one side of a large stone slab\n(formerly probably rotating) is seen the stereotyped overthrowing and\nsacrifice of the bull, but upon the other side stands Sol, with a bunch\nof grapes in his hand, Mithra with the cornucopia, the Dadophores with\nfruits, corresponding to the legend that all fecundity proceeds from the\ndead bull of the world, fruits from the horns, wine from its blood,\ngrain from the tail, cattle from its sperma, leek from its nose, and so\non.",
    "Silvanus stands above this scene with the animals of the forest\narising from him.",

    "Here again we meet with\nthe idea of the “terrible mother” in the form of the voracious fish, the\nmouth of death.[513] In Frobenius there are numerous examples where the\nmonster has devoured not only men but also animals, plants, an entire\ncountry, all of which are redeemed by the hero to a glorious rebirth.",

    "He approaches Tiâmat and challenges her to a combat.",
    "“Then Tiâmat and Marduk, the wise one of the gods, came together,\n   Rising for the fight, approaching to the battle:\n   Then the lord spread out his net and caught her.\n   ",
    "He let loose the Imḫullu in his train at her face,\n   Then Tiâmat now opened her mouth as wide as she could.\n   ",

    "The snake or dragon possesses in\nparticular the meaning of treasure guardian and defender.",
    "The phallic,\nas well as the feminine, meaning of the dragon[542] indicates that it is\nagain a symbol of the sexual neutral (or bisexual) libido, that is to\nsay, a symbol of the _libido in opposition_.",

    "Python, the dragon of Leto, and\nPoine, who devastates the land of Crotopus, are sent by the father of\nthe new-born.",
    "This idea indicates the localization, well known in\npsychoanalysis, of the incest anxiety in the father.",
    "The father\nrepresents the active repulse of the incest wish of the son.",
    "The crime,\nunconsciously wished for by the son, is imputed to the father under the\nguise of a pretended murderous purpose, this being the cause of the\nmortal fear of the son for the father, a frequent neurotic symptom.",
    "In\nconformity with this idea, the monster to be overcome by the young hero\nis frequently a giant, the guardian of the treasure or the woman.",
    "A\nstriking example is the giant Chumbaba in the Gilgamesh epic, who\nprotected the garden of Ishtar;[545] he is overcome by Gilgamesh,\nwhereby Ishtar is won.",
    "Thereupon she makes erotic advances towards\nGilgamesh.[546] This data should be sufficient to render intelligible\nthe rôle of Horus in Plutarch, especially the violent usage of Isis.\n",
    "Through overpowering the mother the hero becomes equal to the sun; he\nreproduces himself.",
    "He wins the strength of the invincible sun, the\npower of eternal rejuvenation.",
    "We thus understand a series of\nrepresentations from the Mithraic myth on the Heddernheim relief.",
    "There\nwe see, first of all, the birth of Mithra from the top of the tree; the\nnext representation shows him carrying the conquered bull (comparable to\nthe monstrous bull overcome by Gilgamesh).",
    "This bull signifies the\nconcentrated significance of the monster, the father, who as giant and\ndangerous animal embodies the incest prohibition, and agrees with the\nindividual libido of the sun-hero, which he overcomes by self-sacrifice.\n",
    "The third picture represents Mithra, when he grasps the head ornament of\nthe sun, the nimbus.",
    "This act recalls to us, first of all, the violence\nof Horus towards Isis; secondly, the Christian basic thought, _that\nthose who have overcome attain the crown of eternal life_.",
    "On the fourth\npicture Sol kneels before Mithra.",
    "These last two representations show\nplainly that Mithra has taken to himself the strength of the sun, so\nthat he becomes the lord of the sun as well.",
    "He has conquered “his\nanimal nature,” the bull.",
    "The animal knows no incest prohibition; man\nis, therefore, man because he conquers the incest wish, that is, the\nanimal nature.",
    "Thus Mithra has sacrificed his animal nature, the incest\nwish, and with that has overcome the mother, that is to say, “the\nterrible death-bringing mother.”",
    "A solution is already anticipated in\nthe Gilgamesh epic through the formal renunciation of the horrible\nIshtar by the hero.",
    "The overcoming of the mother in the Mithraic\nsacrifice, which had almost an ascetic character, took place no longer\nby the archaic overpowering, but through the renunciation, the sacrifice\nof the wish.",
    "The primitive thought of incestuous reproduction through\nentrance into the mother’s womb had already been displaced, because man\nwas so far advanced in domestication that he believed that the eternal\nlife of the sun is reached, not through the perpetration of incest, but\nthrough the sacrifice of the incest wish.",
    "This important change\nexpressed in the Mithraic mystery finds its full expression for the\nfirst time in the symbol of the crucified God.",
    "A bleeding human\nsacrifice was hung on the tree of life for Adam’s sins.[547] The\nfirst-born sacrifices its life to the mother when he suffers, hanging on\nthe branch, a disgraceful and painful death, a mode of death which\nbelongs to the most ignominious forms of execution, which Roman\nantiquity had reserved for only the lowest criminal.",
    "Thus the hero dies,\nas if he had committed the most shameful crime; he does this by\nreturning into the birth-giving branch of the tree of life, at the same\ntime paying for his guilt with the pangs of death.",
    "The animal nature is\nrepressed most powerfully in this deed of the highest courage and the\ngreatest renunciation; therefore, a greater salvation is to be expected\nfor humanity, because such a deed alone seems appropriate to expiate\nAdam’s guilt.",
    "[Illustration: BULL-SACRIFICE OF MITHRA]",
    "As has already been mentioned, the hanging of the sacrifice on the tree\nis a generally widespread ritual custom, Germanic examples being\nespecially abundant.",
    "The ritual consists in the sacrifice being pierced\nby a spear.[548]",
    "Thus it is said of Odin (Edda, Havamal):",
    "“I know that I hung on the windswept tree\n               Nine nights through,\n               Wounded by a spear, dedicated to Odin\n               I myself to myself.”",
    "The hanging of the sacrifice to the cross also occurred in America prior\nto its discovery.",
    "Müller[549] mentions the Fejervaryian manuscript (a\nMexican hieroglyphic kodex), at the conclusion of which there is a\ncolossal cross, in the middle of which there hangs a bleeding divinity.\n",
    "Equally interesting is the cross of Palenque;[550] up above is a bird,\non either side two human figures, who look at the cross and hold a child\nagainst it either for sacrifice or baptism.",
    "The old Mexicans are said to\nhave invoked the favor of Centeotls, “the daughter of heaven and the\ngoddess of wheat,” every spring by nailing upon the cross a youth or a\nmaiden and by shooting the sacrifice with arrows.[551]",
    "The name of the\nMexican cross signifies “tree of our life or flesh.”[552]",
    "An effigy from the Island of Philae represents Osiris in the form of a\ncrucified god, wept over by Isis and Nephthys, the sister consort.[553]",
    "The meaning of the cross is certainly not limited to the tree of life,\nas has already been shown.",
    "Just as the tree of life has also a phallic\nsub-meaning (as libido symbol), so there is a further significance to\nthe cross than life and immortality.[554] Müller uses it as a sign of\nrain and of fertility, because it appears among the Indians distinctly\nas a magic charm of fertility.",
    "It goes without saying, therefore, that\nit plays a rôle in the sun cult.",
    "It is also noteworthy that the sign of\nthe cross is an important sign for the keeping away of all evil, like\nthe ancient gesture of Manofica.",
    "The phallic amulets also serve the same\npurpose.",
    "Zöckler appears to have overlooked the fact that the phallic\nCrux Ansata is the same cross which has flourished in countless examples\nin the soil of antiquity.",
    "Copies of this Crux Ansata are found in many\nplaces, and almost every collection of antiquities possesses one or more\nspecimens.[555]",
    "Finally, it must be mentioned that the form of the human body is\nimitated in the cross as of a man with arms outspread.",
    "It is remarkable\nthat in early Christian representations Christ is not nailed to the\ncross, but stands before it with arms outstretched.[556] Maurice[557]\ngives a striking basis for this interpretation when he says:",
    "“It is a fact not less remarkable than well attested, that the Druids\n  in their groves were accustomed to select the most stately and\n  beautiful tree as an emblem of the deity they adored, and cutting off\n  the side branches, they affixed two of the largest of them to the\n  highest part of the trunk, in such a manner that those branches\n  extended on each side like the arms of a man, and together with the\n  body presented the appearance of a huge cross; and in the bark in\n  several places was also inscribed the letter Τ (tau).”[558]",
    "“The tree of knowledge” of the Hindoo Dschaina sect assumes human form;\nit was represented as a mighty, thick trunk in the form of a human head,\nfrom the top of which grew out two longer branches hanging down at the\nsides and one short, vertical, uprising branch crowned by a bud or\nblossom-like thickening.[559] Robertson in his “Evangelical Myths”\nmentions that in the Assyrian system there exists the representation of\nthe divinity in the form of a cross, in which the vertical beam\ncorresponds to a human form and the horizontal beam to a pair of\nconventionalized wings.",
    "Old Grecian idols such, for example, as were\nfound in large numbers in Aegina have a similar character, an\nimmoderately long head and arms slightly raised, wing-shaped, and in\nfront distinct breasts.[560]",
    "I must leave it an open question as to whether the symbol of the cross\nhas any relation to the two pieces of wood in the religious fire\nproduction, as is frequently claimed.",
    "It does appear, however, as if the\ncross symbol actually still possessed the significance of “union,” for\nthis idea belongs to the fertility charm, and especially to the thought\nof eternal rebirth, which is most intimately bound up with the cross.\n",
    "The thought of “union,” expressed by the symbol of the cross, is met\nwith in “Timaios” of Plato, where the world soul is conceived as\nstretched out between heaven and earth in the form of an X (Chi); hence\nin the form of a “St. Andrew’s cross.”",
    "When we now learn, furthermore,\nthat the world soul contains in itself _the world as a body_, then this\npicture inevitably reminds us of the mother.",
    "(_Dialogues of Plato._",
    "Jowett, Vol. II, page 528.)",
    "“And in the center he put the soul, which he diffused through the\n  whole, and also spread over all the body round about, and he made one\n  solitary and only heaven, a circle moving in a circle, having such\n  excellence as to be able to hold converse with itself, and needing no\n  other friendship or acquaintance.",
    "Having these purposes in view he\n  created the world to be a blessed god.”",
    "This highest degree of inactivity and freedom from desire, symbolized\nby the _being enclosed within itself_, signifies divine blessedness.\n",
    "The only human prototype of this conception is the child in the\nmother’s womb, or rather more, the adult man in the continuous embrace\nof the mother, from whom he originates.",
    "Corresponding to this\nmythologic-philosophic conception, the enviable Diogenes inhabited a\ntub, thus giving mythologic expression to the blessedness and\nresemblance to the Divine in his freedom from desire.",
    "Plato says as\nfollows of the bond of the world soul to the world body:",
    "“Now God did not make the soul after the body, although we have spoken\n  of them in this order; for when he put them together he would never\n  have allowed that the elder should serve the younger, but this is what\n  we say at random, because we ourselves too are very largely affected\n  by chance.",
    "Whereas he made the soul in origin and excellence prior to\n  and older than the body, to be the ruler and mistress, of whom the\n  body was to be the subject.”",
    "It seems conceivable from other indications that the conception of the\nsoul in general is a derivative of the mother-imago, that is to say, a\nsymbolic designation for the amount of libido remaining in the\nmother-imago.",
    "(Compare the Christian representation of the soul as the\nbride of Christ.)",
    "The further development of the world soul in “Timaios”\ntakes place in an obscure fashion in mystic numerals.",
    "When the mixture\nwas completed the following occurred:",
    "“This entire compound he divided lengthways into two parts, which he\n  joined to one another at the center like the figure of an X.”",
    "This passage approaches very closely the division and union of Atman,\nwho, after the division, is compared to a man and a woman who hold each\nother in an embrace.",
    "Another passage is worth mentioning:",
    "“After the entire union of the soul had taken place, according to the\n  master’s mind, he formed all that is corporeal within this, and joined\n  it together so as to penetrate it throughout.”",
    "Moreover, I refer to my remarks about the maternal meaning of the world\nsoul in Plotinus, in Chapter II.",
    "A similar detachment of the symbol of the cross from a concrete figure\nwe find among the Muskhogean Indians, who stretch above the surface of\nthe water (pond or stream) two ropes crosswise and at the point of\nintersection throw into the water fruits, oil and precious stones as a\nsacrifice.[561] Here the divinity is evidently the water, not the cross,\nwhich designates the place of sacrifice only, through the point of\nintersection.",
    "The sacrifice at the place of union indicates why this\nsymbol was a primitive charm of fertility,[562] why we meet it so\nfrequently in the prechristian era among the goddesses of love (mother\ngoddesses), especially among the Egyptians in Isis and the sun-god.",
    "We\nhave already discussed the continuous union of these two divinities.",
    "As\nthe cross (Tau [Τ], Crux Ansata) always recurs in the hand of Tum, the\nsupreme God, the hegemon of the Ennead, it may not be superfluous to say\nsomething more of the destination of Tum.",
    "The Tum of On-Heliopolis bears\nthe name “the father of his mother”; what that means needs no\nexplanation; Jusas or Nebit-Hotpet, the goddess joined to him, _was\ncalled sometimes the mother, sometimes the daughter, sometimes the wife\nof the god_.",
    "The day of the beginning of autumn is designated in the\nHeliopolitan inscriptions as the “festival of the goddess Jusasit,” as\n“the arrival of the sister for the purpose of uniting with her father.”\n",
    "It is the day in which “the goddess Mehnit completes her work, so that\nthe god Osiris may enter into the left eye.”",
    "(By which the moon is\nmeant.[563])",
    "The day is also called the filling up of the sacred eye\nwith its needs.",
    "The heavenly cow with the moon eye, the cow-headed Isis,\ntakes to herself in the autumn equinox the seed which procreates Horus.\n",
    "(Moon as keeper of the seed.)",
    "The “eye” evidently represents the\ngenitals, as in the myth of Indra, who had to bear spread over his whole\nbody the likeness of Yoni (vulva), on account of a Bathsheba outrage,\nbut was so far pardoned by the gods that the disgraceful likeness of\nYoni was changed into eyes.[564] The “pupil” in the eye is a child.",
    "The\ngreat god becomes a child again; he enters the mother’s womb in order to\nrenew himself.[565]",
    "In a hymn it is said:",
    "“Thy mother, the heavens, stretches forth her arms to thee.”",
    "In another place it is said:",
    "“Thou shinest, oh father of the gods, upon the back of thy mother,\n  daily thy mother takes thee in her arms.",
    "When thou illuminatest the\n  dwelling of night, thou unitest with thy mother, the heavens.”[566]",
    "The Tum of Pitum-Heliopolis not only bears the Crux Ansata as a symbol,\nbut also has this sign as his most frequent surname, that is, ānχ or\nānχi, which means “life” or “the living.”",
    "He is chiefly honored as the\ndemon serpent, Agatho, of whom it is said, “The holy demon serpent\nAgatho goes forth from the city Nezi.”",
    "The snake, on account of casting\nits skin, is the symbol of renewal, as is the scarabæus, a symbol of the\nsun, of whom it is said that he, being of masculine sex only, reproduces\nhimself.",
    "The name Chnum (another name for Tum, always meaning “the sun-god”)\ncomes from the verb χnum, which means “to bind together, to unite.",
    "”[567]\nChnum appears chiefly as the potter, the moulder of his egg.",
    "The cross\nseems, therefore, to be an extraordinarily condensed symbol; its supreme\nmeaning is that of the tree of life, and, therefore, is a symbol of the\nmother.",
    "The symbolization in a human form is, therefore, intelligible.\n",
    "The phallic forms of the Crux Ansata belong to the abstract meaning of\n“life” and “fertility,” as well as to the meaning of “union,” which we\ncan now very properly interpret as _cohabitation with the mother for the\npurpose of renewal_.[568] It is, therefore, not only a very touching but\nalso a very significant naïve symbolism when Mary, in an Old English\nlament of the Virgin,[569] accuses the cross of being a false tree,\nwhich unjustly and without reason destroyed “the pure fruit of her body,\nher gentle birdling,” with a poisonous draught, the draught of death,\nwhich is destined only for the guilty descendants of the sinner Adam.\n",

    "The holy cross answers:",
    "“Woman, I thank thee for my honor: thy splendid fruit, which now I\n  bear, shines as a red blossom.[570] Not alone to save thee but to save\n  the whole world this precious flower blooms in thee.”[571]",
    "Santa Crux says of the relation to each other of the two mothers (Isis\nin the morning and Isis in the evening):",
    "“Thou hast been crowned as Queen of Heaven on account of the child,\n  which thou hast borne.",
    "But I shall appear as the shining relic to the\n  whole world, at the day of judgment.",
    "I shall then raise my lament for\n  thy divine son innocently slain upon me.”",
    "Thus the murderous mother of death unites with the mother of life in\nbringing forth a child.",
    "In their lament for the dying God, and as\noutward token of their union, Mary kisses the cross, and is reconciled\nto it.[572]",
    "The naïve Egyptian antiquity has preserved for us the union\nof the contrasting tendencies in the mother idea of Isis.",
    "Naturally this\nimago is merely a symbol of the libido of the son for the mother, and\ndescribes the conflict between love and incest resistance.",
    "The criminal\nincestuous purpose of the son appears projected as criminal cunning in\nthe mother-imago.",
    "The separation of the son from the mother signifies\nthe separation of man from the generic consciousness of animals, from\nthat infantile archaic thought characterized by the absence of\nindividual consciousness.",
    "It was only the power of the incest prohibition which created the\nself-conscious individual, who formerly had been thoughtlessly one with\nthe tribe, and in this way alone did the idea of individual and final\ndeath become possible.",
    "Thus through the sin of Adam death came into the\nworld.",
    "This, as is evident, is expressed figuratively, that is, in\ncontrast form.",
    "The mother’s defence against the incest appears to the\nson as a malicious act, which delivers him over to the fear of death.\n",
    "This conflict faces us in the Gilgamesh epic in its original freshness\nand passion, where also the incest wish is projected onto the mother.",
    "The neurotic who cannot leave the mother has good reasons; the fear of\ndeath holds him there.",
    "It seems as if no idea and no word were strong\nenough to express the meaning of this.",
    "Entire religions were constructed\nin order to give words to the immensity of this conflict.",
    "This struggle\nfor expression which continued down through the centuries certainly\ncannot have its source in the restricted realm of the vulgar conception\nof incest.",
    "Rather one must understand the law which is ultimately\nexpressed as “Incest prohibition” as coercion to domestication, and\nconsider the religious systems as institutions which first receive, then\norganize and gradually sublimate, the motor forces of the animal nature\nnot immediately available for cultural purposes.",
    "We will now return to the visions of Miss Miller.",
    "Those now following\nneed no further detailed discussion.",
    "The next vision is the image of a\n“purple bay.”",
    "The symbolism of the sea connects smoothly with that which\nprecedes.",
    "One might think here in addition of the reminiscences of the\nBay of Naples, which we came across in Part I.",
    "In the sequence of the\nwhole, however, we must not overlook the significance of the “bay.”",
    "In\nFrench it is called _une baie_, which probably corresponds to a bay in\nthe English text.",
    "It might be worth while here to glance at the\netymological side of this idea.",
    "Bay is generally used for something\nwhich is open, just as the Catalonian word _badia_ (_bai_) comes from\n_badar_, “to open.”",
    "In French _bayer_ means “to have the mouth open, to\ngape.”",
    "Another word for the same is _Meerbusen_, “bay or gulf”; Latin\n_sinus_, and a third word is golf (gulf), which in French stands in\nclosest relation to _gouffre_ = abyss.",
    "Golf is derived from\n“κόλπος,”[573] which also means “bosom” and “womb,” “mother-womb,” also\n“vagina.”",
    "It can also mean a fold of a dress or pocket; it may also mean\na deep valley between high mountains.",
    "These expressions clearly show\nwhat primitive ideas lie at their base.",
    "They render intelligible\nGoethe’s choice of words at that place where Faust wishes to follow the\nsun with winged desire in order in the everlasting day “to drink its\neternal light”:",
    "“The mountain chain with all its gorges deep,\n             Would then no more impede my godlike motion;\n             And now before mine eyes expands the ocean,\n             With all its bays, in shining sleep!”",
    "Faust’s desire, like that of every hero, inclines towards the mysteries\nof rebirth, of immortality; therefore, his course leads to the sea, and\ndown into the monstrous jaws of death, the horror and narrowness of\nwhich at the same time signify the new day.",
    "“Out on the open ocean speeds my dreaming:\n      The glassy flood before my feet is gleaming,\n      A new day beckons to a newer shore!\n      ",

    "Nor from that gloomy gulf to shrink affrighted,\n      Where fancy doth herself to self-born pangs compel,—\n      To struggle toward that pass benighted,\n      Around whose narrow mouth flame all the fires of Hell:—\n      To take this step with cheerful resolution,\n      Though Nothingness should be the certain swift conclusion!”",
    "It sounds like a confirmation, when the succeeding vision of Miss\nMiller’s is _une falaise à pic_, “a steep, precipitous cliff.”",
    "(Compare\n_gouffre_.)",
    "The entire series of individual visions is completed, as the\nauthor observes, by a confusion of sounds, somewhat resembling “wa-ma,\nwa-ma.”",
    "This has a very primitive, barbaric sound.",
    "Since we learn from\nthe author nothing of the subjective roots of this sound, nothing is\nleft us but the suspicion that this sound might be considered, taken in\nconnection with the whole, as a slight mutilation of the well-known call\nma-ma.",
    "CHAPTER VI\n               THE BATTLE FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE MOTHER",
    "There now comes a pause in the production of visions by Miss Miller;\nthen the activity of the unconscious is resumed very energetically.",
    "A forest with trees and bushes appears.",
    "After the discussions in the preceding chapter, there is need only of a\nhint that the symbol of the forest coincides essentially with the\nmeaning of the holy tree.",
    "The holy tree is found generally in a sacred\nforest enclosure or in the garden of Paradise.",
    "The sacred grove often\ntakes the place of the taboo tree and assumes all the attributes of the\nlatter.",
    "The erotic symbolism of the garden is generally known.",
    "The\nforest, like the tree, has mythologically a maternal significance.",
    "In\nthe vision which now follows, the forest furnishes the stage upon which\nthe dramatic representation of the end of Chiwantopel is played.",
    "This\nact, therefore, takes place in or near the mother.",
    "First, I will give the beginning of the drama as it is in the original\ntext, up to the first attempt at sacrifice.",
    "At the beginning of the next\nchapter the reader will find the continuation, the monologue and the\nsacrificial scene.",
    "The drama begins as follows:",
    "“The personage Chiwantopel, came from the south, on horseback; around\n  him a cloak of vivid colors, red, blue and white.",
    "An Indian in a\n  costume of doe skin, covered with beads and ornamented with feathers\n  advances, squats down and prepares to let fly an arrow at Chiwantopel.\n  ",
    "The latter presents his breast in an attitude of defiance, and the\n  Indian, fascinated by that sight, slinks away and disappears within\n  the forest.”",
    "The hero, Chiwantopel, appears on horseback.",
    "This fact seems of\nimportance, because as the further course of the drama shows (see\nChapter VIII) the horse plays no indifferent rôle, but suffers the same\ndeath as the hero, and is even called “faithful brother” by the latter.\n",
    "These allusions point to a remarkable similarity between horse and\nrider.",
    "There seems to exist an intimate connection between the two,\nwhich guides them to the same destiny.",
    "We already have seen that the\nsymbolization of “the libido in resistance” through the “terrible\nmother” in some places runs parallel with the horse.[574] Strictly\nspeaking, it would be incorrect to say that the horse is, or means, the\nmother.",
    "The mother idea is a libido symbol, and the horse is also a\nlibido symbol, and at some points the two symbols intersect in their\nsignificances.",
    "The common feature of the two ideas lies in the libido,\nespecially in the libido repressed from incest.",
    "The hero and the horse\nappear to us in this setting like an artistic formation of the idea of\nhumanity with its repressed libido, whereby the horse acquires the\nsignificance of the animal unconscious, which appears domesticated and\nsubjected to the will of man.",
    "Agni upon the ram, Wotan upon Sleipneir,\nAhuramazda upon Angromainyu,[575]",
    "Jahwe upon the monstrous seraph,\nChrist upon the ass,[576] Dionysus upon the ass, Mithra upon the horse,\nMen upon the human-footed horse, Freir upon the golden-bristled boar,\netc., are parallel representations.",
    "The chargers of mythology are always\ninvested with great significance; they very often appear\nanthropomorphized.",
    "Thus, Men’s horse has human forelegs; Balaam’s ass,\nhuman speech; the retreating bull, upon whose back Mithra springs in\norder to strike him down, is, according to a Persian legend, actually\nthe God himself.",
    "The mock crucifix of the Palatine represents the\ncrucified with an ass’s head, perhaps in reference to the ancient legend\nthat in the temple of Jerusalem the image of an ass was worshipped.",
    "As\nDrosselbart (horse’s mane) Wotan is half-human, half-horse.[577]",
    "An old\nGerman riddle very prettily shows this unity between horse and\nhorseman.[578] “Who are the two, who travel to Thing?",
    "Together they have\nthree eyes, ten feet[579] and one tail; and thus they travel over the\nland.”",
    "Legends ascribe properties to the horse, which psychologically\nbelong to the unconscious of man; horses are clairvoyant and\nclairaudient; they show the way when the lost wanderer is helpless; they\nhave mantic powers.",
    "In the Iliad the horse prophesies evil.",
    "They hear\nthe words which the corpse speaks when it is taken to the grave—words\nwhich men cannot hear.",

    "An ass prophesied to Augustus the\nvictory of Actium.",
    "The horse also sees phantoms.",
    "All these things\ncorrespond to typical manifestations of the unconscious.",
    "Therefore, it\nis perfectly intelligible that the horse, as the image of the wicked\nanimal component of man, has manifold connections with the devil.",
    "The\ndevil has a horse’s foot; in certain circumstances a horse’s form.",
    "At\ncrucial moments he suddenly shows a cloven foot (proverbial) in the same\nway as in the abduction of Hadding, Sleipneir suddenly looked out from\nbehind Wotan’s mantle.[580] Just as the nightmare rides on the sleeper,\nso does the devil, and, therefore, it is said that those who have\nnightmares are ridden by the devil.",
    "In Persian lore the devil is the\nsteed of God.",
    "The devil, like all evil things, represents sexuality.\n",
    "Witches have intercourse with him, in which case he appears in the form\nof a goat or horse.",
    "The unmistakably phallic nature of the devil is\ncommunicated to the horse as well; hence this symbol occurs in\nconnections where this is the only meaning which would furnish an\nexplanation.",
    "It is to be mentioned that Loki generates in the form of a\nhorse, just as does the devil when in horse’s form, as an old fire god.\n",
    "Thus the lightning was represented theriomorphically as a horse.[581] An\nuneducated hysteric told me that as a child she had suffered from\nextreme fear of thunder, because every time the lightning flashed she\nsaw immediately afterwards a huge black horse reaching upwards as far as\nthe sky.[582] It is said in a legend that the devil, as the divinity of\nlightning, casts a horse’s foot (lightning) upon the roofs.",
    "In\naccordance with the primitive meaning of thunder as fertilizer of the\nearth, the phallic meaning is given both to lightning and the horse’s\nfoot.",
    "In mythology the horse’s foot really has the phallic function as\nin this dream.",
    "An uneducated patient who originally had been violently\nforced to coitus by her husband very often dreams (after separation)\nthat a wild horse springs upon her and kicks her in the abdomen with his\nhind foot.",

    "The analytic interpretation of Cassius’s irritability plainly reveals\nthat at these moments he identifies himself with the mother, and his\nconduct, therefore, is truly feminine, as his speech demonstrates most\nexcellently.",
    "For his womanish love-seeking and desperate subjection\nunder the proud masculine will of Brutus calls forth the friendly remark\nof the latter, that Cassius is yoked with a lamb, that is to say, has\nsomething very weak in his character, which is derived from the mother.\n",
    "One recognizes in this without any difficulty the analytic hall-marks of\nan infantile disposition, which, as always, is characterized by a\nprevalence of the parent-imago, here the mother-imago.",
    "An infantile\nindividual is infantile because he has freed himself insufficiently, or\nnot at all, from the childish environment, that is, from his adaptation\nto his parents.",
    "Therefore, on one side, he reacts falsely towards the\nworld, as a child towards his parents, always demanding love and\nimmediate reward for his feelings; on the other side, on account of the\nclose connection to the parents, he identifies himself with them.",
    "The\ninfantile individual behaves like the father and mother.",
    "He is not in a\ncondition to live for himself and to find the place to which he belongs.\n",
    "Therefore, Brutus very justly takes it for granted that the “mother\nchides” in Cassius, not he himself.",
    "The psychologically valuable fact\nwhich we gather here is the information _that Cassius is infantile and\nidentified_ with the mother.",
    "The hysterical behavior is due to the\ncircumstance that Cassius is still, in part, a lamb, and _an innocent\nand entirely harmless child_.",
    "He remains, as far as his emotional life\nis concerned, still far behind himself.",
    "This we often see among people\nwho, as masters, apparently govern life and fellow-creatures; they have\nremained children in regard to the demands of their love nature.",
    "The figures of the Miller dramas, being children of the creator’s\nphantasy, depict, as is natural, those traits of character which belong\nto the author.",
    "The hero, the wish figure, is represented as most\ndistinguished, because the hero always combines in himself all\nwished-for ideals.",
    "Cyrano’s attitude is certainly beautiful and\nimpressive; Cassius’s behavior has a theatrical effect.",
    "Both heroes\nprepare to die effectively, in which attempt Cyrano succeeds.",
    "This\nattitude betrays a wish for death in the unconscious of our author, the\nmeaning of which we have already discussed at length as the motive for\nher poem of the moth.",
    "The wish of young girls to die is only an indirect\nexpression, which remains a pose, even in case of real death, for death\nitself can be a pose.",
    "Such an outcome merely adds beauty and value to\nthe pose under certain conditions.",
    "That the highest summit of life is\nexpressed through the symbolism of death is a well-known fact; for\ncreation beyond one’s self means personal death.",
    "The coming generation\nis the end of the preceding one.",
    "This symbolism is frequent in erotic\nspeech.",
    "The lascivious speech between Lucius and the wanton servant-maid\nin Apuleius (“Metamorphoses,” lib. ii: 32) is one of the clearest\nexamples:",
    "“Proeliare, inquit, et fortiter proeliare: nec enim tibi cedam, nec\n  terga vortam.",
    "Cominus in aspectum, si vir es, dirige; et grassare\n  naviter, et occide moriturus.",
    "Hodierna pugna non habet\n  missionem.—Simul ambo corruimus inter mutuos amplexus animas\n  anhelantes.",
    "”[598]",
    "This symbolism is extremely significant, because it shows how easily a\ncontrasting expression originates and how equally intelligible and\ncharacteristic such an expression is.",
    "The proud gesture with which the\nhero offers himself to death may very easily be an indirect expression\nwhich challenges the pity or sympathy of the other, and thus is doomed\nto the calm analytic reduction to which Brutus proceeds.",
    "The behavior of\nChiwantopel is also suspicious, because the Cassius scene which serves\nas its model betrays indiscreetly that the whole affair is merely\ninfantile and one which owes its origin to an overactive mother imago.\n",
    "When we compare this piece with the series of mother symbols brought to\nlight in the previous chapter, we must say that the Cassius scene merely\nconfirms once more what we have long supposed, that is to say, that the\nmotor power of these symbolic visions arises from an infantile mother\ntransference, that is to say, from an undetached bond to the mother.",
    "In the drama the libido, in contradistinction to the inactive nature of\nthe previous symbols, assumes a threatening activity, a conflict\nbecoming evident, in which the one part threatens the other with murder.\n",
    "The hero, as the ideal image of the dreamer, is inclined to die; he does\nnot fear death.",
    "In accordance with the infantile character of this hero,\nit would most surely be time for him to take his departure from the\nstage, or, in childish language, to die.",
    "Death is to come to him in the\nform of an arrow-wound.",
    "Considering the fact that heroes themselves are\nvery often great archers or succumb to an arrow-wound (St. Sebastian, as\nan example), it may not be superfluous to inquire into the meaning of\ndeath through an arrow.",
    "We read in the biography of the stigmatized nun Katherine Emmerich[599]\nthe following description of the evidently neurotic sickness of her\nheart:",
    "“When only in her novitiate, she received as a Christmas present from\n  the holy Christ a very tormenting heart trouble for the whole period\n  of her nun’s life.",
    "God showed her inwardly the purpose; it was on\n  account of the decline of the spirit of the order, especially for the\n  sins of her fellow-sisters.",
    "But what rendered this trouble most\n  painful was the gift which she had possessed from youth, namely, to\n  see before her eyes the inner nature of man as he really was.",
    "She felt\n  the heart trouble physically as if her heart was continually pierced\n  by arrows.[600] These arrows—and this represented the still worse\n  mental suffering—she recognized as the thoughts, plots, secret\n  speeches, misunderstandings, scandal and uncharitableness, in which\n  her fellow-sisters, wholly without reason and unscrupulously, were\n  engaged against her and her god-fearing way of life.”",
    "It is difficult to be a saint, because even a patient and long-suffering\nnature will not readily bear such a violation, and defends itself in its\nown way.",
    "The companion of sanctity is temptation, without which no true\nsaint can live.",
    "We know from analytic experience that these temptations\ncan pass unconsciously, so that only their equivalents would be produced\nin consciousness in the form of symptoms.",
    "We know that it is proverbial\nthat heart and smart (Herz and Schmerz) rhyme.",
    "It is a well-known fact\nthat hysterics put a physical pain in place of a mental pain.",
    "The\nbiographer of Emmerich has comprehended that very correctly.",
    "Only her\ninterpretation of the pain is, as usual, projected.",
    "It is always the\nothers who secretly assert all sorts of evil things about her, and this\nshe pretended gave her the pains.[601]",
    "The case, however, bears a\nsomewhat different aspect.",
    "The very difficult renunciation of all life’s\njoys, this death before the bloom, is generally painful, and especially\npainful are the unfulfilled wishes and the attempts of the animal nature\nto break through the power of repression.",
    "The gossip and jokes of the\nsisters very naturally centre around these most painful things, so that\nit must appear to the saint as if her symptoms were caused by this.\n",
    "Naturally, again, she could not know that gossip tends to assume the\nrôle of the unconscious, which, like a clever adversary, always aims at\nthe actual gaps in our armor.",
    "A passage from Gautama Buddha embodies this idea:[602]",
    "“A wish earnestly desired\n                  Produced by will, and nourished\n                  When gradually it must be thwarted,\n                  Burrows like an arrow in the flesh.”",
    "The wounding and painful arrows do not come from without through gossip,\nwhich only attacks externally, but they come from ambush, from our own\nunconscious.",
    "This, rather than anything external, creates the\ndefenseless suffering.",
    "It is our _own repressed and unrecognized desires\nwhich fester like arrows in our flesh_.[603]",
    "In another connection this\nwas clear to the nun, and that most literally.",
    "It is a well-known fact,\nand one which needs no further proof to those who understand, that these\nmystic scenes of union with the Saviour generally are intermingled with\nan enormous amount of sexual libido.[604] Therefore, it is not\nastonishing that the scene of the stigmata is nothing but an incubation\nthrough the Saviour, only slightly changed metaphorically, as compared\nwith the ancient conception of “unio mystica,” as cohabitation with the\ngod.",
    "Emmerich relates the following of her stigmatization:",
    "“I had a contemplation of the sufferings of Christ, and implored him\n  to let me feel with him his sorrows, and prayed five paternosters to\n  the honor of the five sacred wounds.",
    "Lying on my bed with outstretched\n  arms, I entered into a great sweetness and into an endless thirst for\n  the torments of Jesus.",
    "Then I saw a light descending upon me: it came\n  obliquely from above.",
    "It was a crucified body, living and transparent,\n  with arms extended, but without a cross.",
    "The wounds shone brighter\n  than the body; they were five circles of glory, coming forth from the\n  whole glory.",
    "I was enraptured and my heart was moved with great pain\n  and yet with sweetness from longing to share in the torments of my\n  Saviour.",
    "And my longings for the sorrows of the Redeemer increased\n  more and more on gazing on his wounds, and passed from my breast,\n  through my hands, sides and feet to his holy wounds: then from the\n  hands, then from the sides, then from the feet of the figure threefold\n  shining red beams ending below in an arrow, shot forth to my hands,\n  sides and feet.”",
    "The beams, in accordance with the phallic fundamental thought, are\nthreefold, terminating below in an arrow-point.[605] Like Cupid, the\nsun, too, has its quiver, full of destroying or fertilizing arrows, sun\nrays,[606] which possess phallic meaning.",
    "On this significance evidently\nrests the Oriental custom of designating brave sons as arrows and\njavelins of the parents.",
    "“To make sharp arrows” is an Arabian expression\nfor “to generate brave sons.”",
    "The Psalms declare (cxxvii:4):",
    "“Like as the arrows in the hands of the giant; even so are the young\n  children.”",
    "(Compare with this the remarks previously made about “boys.”)",
    "Because of\nthis significance of the arrow it is intelligible why the Scythian king\nAriantes, when he wished to prepare a census, demanded an arrow-head\nfrom each man.",
    "A similar meaning attaches equally to the lance.",
    "Men are\ndescended from the lance, because the ash is the mother of lances.\n",
    "Therefore, the men of the Iron Age are derived from her.",
    "The marriage\ncustom to which Ovid alludes (“Comat virgineas hasta recurva\ncomas”—_Fastorum_, lib. ii: 560) has already been mentioned.",
    "Kaineus\nissued a command that his lance be honored.",
    "Pindar relates in the legend\nof this Kaineus:",
    "“He descended into the depths, splitting the earth with a straight\n  foot.”[607]",
    "He is said to have originally been a maiden named Kainis, who, because\nof her complaisance, was transformed into an invulnerable man by\nPoseidon.",
    "Ovid pictures the battle of the Lapithæ with the invulnerable\nKaineus; how at last they covered him completely with trees, because\nthey could not otherwise touch him.",
    "Ovid says at this place:",
    "“Exitus in dubio est: alii sub inania corpus\n           Tartara detrusum silvarum mole ferebant,\n           Abnuit Ampycides: medioque ex aggere fulvis\n           Vidit avem pennis liquidas exire sub auras.”[608]",
    "Roscher considers this bird to be the golden plover (Charadrius\npluvialis), which borrows its name from the fact that it lives in the\nχαράδρα, a crevice in the earth.",
    "By his song he proclaims the\napproaching rain.",
    "Kaineus was changed into this bird.",
    "We see again in this little myth the typical constituents of the libido\nmyth: original bisexuality, immortality (invulnerability) through\nentrance into the mother (splitting the mother with the foot, and to\nbecome covered up) and resurrection as a bird of the soul and a bringer\nof fertility (ascending sun).",
    "When this type of hero causes his lance to\nbe worshipped, it probably means that his lance is a valid and\nequivalent expression of himself.",
    "From our present standpoint, we understand in a new sense that passage\nin Job, which I mentioned in Chapter IV of the first part of this book:",
    "“He has set me up for his mark.",
    "“His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and\n  doth not spare:—he poureth out my gall upon the ground.",
    "“He breaketh me with breach upon breach: he runneth upon me like a\n  giant.”—_Job_ xvi:12–13–14.",
    "Now we understand this symbolism as an expression for the soul torment\ncaused by the onslaught of the unconscious desires.",
    "The libido festers\nin his flesh, a cruel god has taken possession of him and pierced him\nwith his painful libidian projectiles, with thoughts, which\noverwhelmingly pass through him.",
    "(As a dementia præcox patient once said\nto me during his recovery: “To-day a thought suddenly thrust itself\nthrough me.”)",
    "This same idea is found again in Nietzsche in Zarathustra:",
    "_The Magician_",
    "Stretched out, shivering\n           Like one half dead whose feet are warmed,\n           Shaken alas!",

    "No long-drawn-out explanation is necessary to enable us to recognize in\nthis comparison the old, universal idea of the martyred sacrifice of\nGod, which we have met previously in the Mexican sacrifice of the cross\nand in the sacrifice of Odin.[609]",
    "This same conception faces us in the\noft-repeated martyrdom of St. Sebastian, where, in the delicate-glowing\nflesh of the young god, all the pain of renunciation which has been felt\nby the artist has been portrayed.",
    "An artist always embodies in his\nartistic work a portion of the mysteries of his time.",
    "In a heightened\ndegree the same is true of the principal Christian symbol, the crucified\none pierced by the lance, the conception of the man of the Christian era\ntormented by his wishes, crucified and dying in Christ.",
    "This is not torment which comes from without, which befalls mankind; but\nthat he himself is the hunter, murderer, sacrificer and sacrificial\nknife is shown us in another of Nietzsche’s poems, wherein the apparent\ndualism is transformed into the soul conflict through the use of the\nsame symbolism:",

    "The deadly arrows do not strike the hero from without, but it is he\nhimself who, in disharmony with himself, hunts, fights and tortures\nhimself.",
    "Within himself will has turned against will, libido against\nlibido—therefore, the poet says, “Pierced through thyself,” that is to\nsay, wounded by his own arrow.",
    "Because we have discerned that the arrow\nis a libido symbol, the idea of “penetrating or piercing through”\nconsequently becomes clear to us.",
    "It is a phallic act of union with\none’s self, a sort of self-fertilization (introversion); also a\nself-violation, a self-murder; therefore, Zarathustra may call himself\nhis own hangman, like Odin, who sacrifices himself to Odin.",
    "The wounding by one’s own arrow means, first of all, _the state of\nintroversion_.",
    "What this signifies we already know—the libido sinks into\nits “own depths” (a well-known comparison of Nietzsche’s) and finds\nthere below, in the shadows of the unconscious, the substitute for the\nupper world, which it has abandoned: _the world of memories_ (“’mid a\nhundred memories”), the strongest and most influential of which are the\nearly infantile memory pictures.",
    "It is the world of the child, this\nparadise-like state of earliest childhood, from which we are separated\nby a hard law.",
    "In this subterranean kingdom slumber sweet feelings of\nhome and the endless hopes of all that is to be.",
    "As Heinrich in the\n“Sunken Bell,” by Gerhart Hauptmann, says, in speaking of his miraculous\nwork:",
    "“There is a song lost and forgotten,\n             A song of home, a love song of childhood,\n             Brought up from the depths of the fairy well,\n             Known to all, but yet unheard.”",
    "However, as Mephistopheles says, “The danger is great.”",
    "These depths are\nenticing; they are the mother and—death.",
    "When the libido leaves the\nbright upper world, whether from the decision of the individual or from\ndecreasing life force, then it sinks back into its own depths, into the\nsource from which it has gushed forth, and turns back to that point of\ncleavage, the umbilicus, through which it once entered into this body.\n",
    "This point of cleavage is called the mother, because from her comes the\nsource of the libido.",
    "Therefore, when some great work is to be\naccomplished, before which weak man recoils, doubtful of his strength,\nhis libido returns to that source—and this is the dangerous moment, in\nwhich the decision takes place between annihilation and new life.",
    "If the\nlibido remains arrested in the wonder kingdom of the inner world,[610]\nthen the man has become for the world above a phantom, then he is\npractically dead or desperately ill.[611]",
    "But if the libido succeeds in\ntearing itself loose and pushing up into the world above, then a miracle\nappears.",
    "This journey to the underworld has been a fountain of youth,\nand new fertility springs from his apparent death.",
    "This train of thought\nis very beautifully gathered into a Hindoo myth: Once upon a time,\nVishnu sank into an ecstasy (introversion) and during this state of\nsleep bore Brahma, who, enthroned upon the lotus flower, arose from the\nnavel of Vishnu, bringing with him the Vedas, which he diligently read.\n",
    "(Birth of creative thought from introversion.)",
    "But through Vishnu’s\necstasy a devouring flood came upon the world.",
    "(Devouring through\nintroversion, symbolizing the danger of entering into the mother of\ndeath.)",
    "A demon taking advantage of the danger, stole the Vedas from\nBrahma and hid them in the depths.",
    "(Devouring of the libido.)",
    "Brahma\nroused Vishnu, and the latter, transforming himself into a fish, plunged\ninto the flood, fought with the demon (battle with the dragon),\nconquered him and recaptured the Vedas.",
    "(Treasure obtained with\ndifficulty.)",
    "Self-concentration and the strength derived therefrom correspond to this\nprimitive train of thought.",
    "It also explains numerous sacrificial and\nmagic rites which we have already fully discussed.",
    "Thus the impregnable\nTroy falls because the besiegers creep into the belly of a wooden horse;\nfor he alone is a hero who is reborn from the mother, like the sun.",
    "But\nthe danger of this venture is shown by the history of Philoctetes, who\nwas the only one in the Trojan expedition who knew the hidden sanctuary\nof Chryse, where the Argonauts had sacrificed already, and where the\nGreeks planned to sacrifice in order to assure a safe ending to their\nundertaking.",
    "Chryse was a nymph upon the island of Chryse; according to\nthe account of the scholiasts in Sophocles’s “Philoctetes,” this nymph\nloved Philoctetes, and cursed him because he spurned her love.",
    "This\ncharacteristic projection, which is also met with in the Gilgamesh epic,\nshould be referred back, as suggested, to the repressed incest wish of\nthe son, who is represented through the projection as if the mother had\nthe evil wish, for the refusal of which the son was given over to death.\n",
    "In reality, however, the son becomes mortal by separating himself from\nthe mother.",
    "His fear of death, therefore, corresponds to the repressed\nwish to turn back to the mother, and causes him to believe that the\nmother threatens or pursues him.",
    "The teleological significance of this\n_fear of persecution_ is evident; _it is to keep son and mother apart_.",
    "The curse of Chryse is realized in so far that Philoctetes, according to\none version, when approaching his altar, injured himself in his foot\nwith one of his own deadly poisonous arrows, or, according to another\nversion[612] (this is better and far more abundantly proven), _was\nbitten in his foot by a poisonous serpent_.[613] From then on he is\nailing.[614]",
    "This very typical wound, which also destroyed Rê, is described in the\nfollowing manner in an Egyptian hymn:",
    "“The ancient of the Gods moved his mouth,\n          He cast his saliva upon the earth,\n          And what he spat, fell upon the ground.\n          ",
    "With her hands Isis kneaded that and the soil\n          Which was about it, together:\n          From that she created a venerable worm,\n          And made him like a spear.\n          ",
    "She did not twist him living around her face,\n          But threw him coiled upon the path,\n          Upon which the great God wandered at ease\n          Through all his lands.",
    "“The venerable God stepped forth radiantly,\n          The gods who served Pharaoh accompanied him,\n          And he proceeded as every day.\n          ",
    "Then the venerable worm stung him....\n          ",
    "The divine God opened his mouth\n          ",
    "And the voice of his majesty echoed even to the sky.\n          ",
    "And the gods exclaimed:",
    "Behold!\n          ",
    "Thereupon he could not answer,\n          His jaws chattered,\n          All his limbs trembled\n          And the poison gripped his flesh,\n          As the Nile seizes upon the land.”",
    "In this hymn Egypt has again preserved for us a primitive conception of\nthe serpent’s sting.",
    "The aging of the autumn sun as an image of human\nsenility is symbolically traced back to the mother through the poisoning\nby the serpent.",
    "The mother is reproached, because her malice causes the\ndeath of the sun-god.",
    "The serpent, the primitive symbol of fear,[615]\nillustrates the repressed tendency to turn back to the mother, because\nthe only possibility of security from death is possessed by the mother,\nas the source of life.",
    "Accordingly, only the mother can cure him, sick unto death, and,\ntherefore, the hymn goes on to depict how the gods were assembled to\ntake counsel:",
    "“And Isis came with her wisdom:\n      Her mouth is full of the breath of life,\n      Her words banish sorrow,\n      And her speech animates those who no longer breathe.\n      ",
    "She said: ‘What is that; what is that, divine father?\n      ",
    "Behold, a worm has brought you sorrow——’",
    "“‘Tell me thy name, divine father,\n      Because the man remains alive, who is called by his name.’”",
    "Whereupon Rê replied:",

    "I am he, who made the water and caused the great flood,\n    Who produced the bull of his mother,\n    Who is the procreator,’ etc.",
    "“The poison did not depart, it went further,\n    The great God was not cured.\n    ",

    "Finally Rê decides to speak his true name.",
    "He is approximately healed\n(imperfect composition of Osiris); but he has lost his power, and\nfinally he retreats to the heavenly cow.",
    "The poisonous worm is, if one may speak in this way, a “negative”\nphallus, a deadly, not an animating, form of libido; therefore, a wish\nfor death, instead of a wish for life.",
    "The “true name” is soul and magic\npower; hence a symbol of libido.",
    "What Isis demands is the retransference\nof the libido to the mother goddess.",
    "This request is fulfilled\nliterally, for the aged god turns back to the divine cow, the symbol of\nthe mother.[616]",

    "It is rather the\nmother-imago, which becomes the Lamia.",
    "The mother-imago, however,\npossesses its power solely and exclusively from the son’s tendency not\nonly to look and to work forwards, but also to glance backwards to the\npampering sweetness of childhood, to that glorious state of\nirresponsibility and security with which the protecting mother-care once\nsurrounded him.[617]",
    "The retrospective longing acts like a paralyzing poison upon the energy\nand enterprise; so that it may well be compared to a poisonous serpent\nwhich lies across our path.",
    "Apparently, it is a hostile demon which robs\nus of energy, but, in reality, it is the individual unconscious, the\nretrogressive tendency of which begins to overcome the conscious forward\nstriving.",
    "The cause of this can be, for example, the natural aging which\nweakens the energy, or it may be great external difficulties, which\ncause man to break down and become a child again, or it may be, and this\nis probably the most frequent cause, the woman who enslaves the man, so\nthat he can no longer free himself, and becomes a child again.[618]",
    "It\nmay be of significance also that Isis, as sister-wife of the sun-god,\ncreates the poisonous animal from the spittle of the god, which is\nperhaps a substitute for sperma, and, therefore, is a symbol of libido.\n",

    "There is still to be considered one more source of the reanimation of\nthe mother-imago.",
    "We have already met it in the discussion of the mother\nscene in “Faust,” that is to say, _the willed introversion of a creative\nmind_, which, retreating before its own problem and inwardly collecting\nits forces, dips at least for a moment into the source of life, in order\nthere to wrest a little more strength from the mother for the completion\nof its work.",

    "There\n  is not one among them all who has known my soul, not one who could\n  read my thought; far from it; not one capable of seeking with me the\n  luminous summits, or of spelling with me the superhuman word, love.”",
    "Here Chiwantopel himself says that his journeying and wandering is a\nquest for that other, and for the meaning of life which lies in union\nwith her.",
    "In the first part of this work we merely hinted gently at this\npossibility.",
    "The fact that the seeker is masculine and the sought-for of\nfeminine sex is not so astonishing, because the chief object of the\nunconscious transference is the mother, as has probably been seen from\nthat which we have already learned.",
    "The daughter takes a male attitude\ntowards the mother.",
    "The genesis of this adjustment can only be suspected\nin our case, because objective proof is lacking.",
    "Therefore, let us\nrather be satisfied with inferences.",
    "“She who will understand” means the\nmother, in the infantile language.",
    "At the same time, it also means the\nlife companion.",
    "As is well known, the sex contrast concerns the libido\nbut little.",
    "The sex of the object plays a surprisingly slight rôle in\nthe estimation of the unconscious.",
    "The object itself, taken as an\nobjective reality, is but of slight significance.",
    "(But it is of greatest\nimportance whether the libido is transferred or introverted.)",
    "The\noriginal concrete meaning of _erfassen_, “to seize,” _begreifen_, “to\ntouch,” etc., allows us to recognize clearly the under side of the\nwish—to find a congenial person.",
    "But the “upper” intellectual half is\nalso contained in it, and is to be taken into account at the same time.\n",
    "One might be inclined to assume this tendency if it were not that our\nculture abused the same, for the misunderstood woman has become almost\nproverbial, which can only be the result of a wholly distorted\nvaluation.",
    "On the one side, our culture undervalues most extraordinarily\nthe importance of sexuality; on the other side, sexuality breaks out as\na direct result of the repression burdening it at every place where it\ndoes not belong, and makes use of such an indirect manner of expression\nthat one may expect to meet it suddenly almost anywhere.",
    "Thus the idea\nof the intimate comprehension of a human soul, which is in reality\nsomething very beautiful and pure, is soiled and disagreeably distorted\nthrough the entrance of the indirect sexual meaning.[628]",
    "The secondary\nmeaning or, better expressed, the misuse, which repressed and denied\nsexuality forces upon the highest soul functions, makes it possible, for\nexample, for certain of our opponents to scent in psychoanalysis\nprurient erotic confessionals.",
    "These are subjective wish-fulfilment\ndeliria which need no contra arguments.",
    "This misuse makes the wish to be\n“understood” highly suspicious, if the natural demands of life have not\nbeen fulfilled.",
    "Nature has _first claim_ on man; only long afterwards\ndoes the luxury of intellect come.",
    "The mediæval ideal of life for the\nsake of death needs gradually to be replaced by a natural conception of\nlife, in which the normal demands of men are thoroughly kept in mind, so\nthat the desires of the animal sphere may no longer be compelled to drag\ndown into their service the high gifts of the intellectual sphere in\norder to find an outlet.",
    "We are inclined, therefore, to consider the\ndreamer’s wish for understanding, first of all, as a repressed striving\ntowards the natural destiny.",
    "This meaning coincides absolutely with\npsychoanalytic experience, that there are countless neurotic people who\napparently are prevented from experiencing life because they have an\nunconscious and often also a conscious repugnance to the sexual fate,\nunder which they imagine all kinds of ugly things.",
    "There is only too\ngreat an inclination to yield to this pressure of the unconscious\nsexuality and to experience the dreaded (unconsciously hoped for)\ndisagreeable sexual experience, so as to acquire by that means a\nlegitimately founded horror which retains them more surely in the\ninfantile situation.",
    "This is the reason why so many people fall into\nthat very state towards which they have the greatest abhorrence.",
    "That we were correct in our assumption that, in Miss Miller, it is a\nquestion of the battle for independence is shown by her statement that\nthe hero’s departure from his father’s house reminds her of the fate of\nthe young Buddha, who likewise renounced all luxury to which he was born\nin order to go out into the world to live out his destiny to its\ncompletion.",
    "Buddha gave the same heroic example as did Christ, who\nseparated from his mother, and even spoke bitter words (Matthew, chap.\nx. v. 34):",

    "The people, who saw her fall downwards,\nthought that she was a _shooting star_.",
    "This marvellous descent of\nNokomis is more plainly illustrated by a later passage of this same\nsong; there little Hiawatha asks the grandmother what is the moon.\n",
    "Nokomis teaches him about it as follows: The moon is the body of a\n_grandmother_, whom a warlike grandson has cast up there in wrath.",
    "Hence\nthe moon is the _grandmother_.",
    "In ancient beliefs, the moon is also the\ngathering place of departed souls,[636] the guardian of seeds;\ntherefore, once more a place of the origin of life of predominantly\nfeminine significance.",
    "The remarkable thing is that Nokomis, falling\nupon the earth, gave birth to a daughter, Wenonah, subsequently the\nmother of Hiawatha.",
    "The throwing upwards of the mother, and her falling\ndown and bringing forth, seems to contain something typical in itself.\n",

    "Possibly\nthere is here a connection with barbaric midwifery, the letting fall of\nthe parturient.",
    "The assault upon the mother is already introduced with\nthe adventure of Mudjekeewis, and is continued in the violent handling\nof the “grandmother,” Nokomis, who, as a result of the cutting of the\nliana and the fall downwards, seems in some way to have become pregnant.\n",

    "For the completion of the symbolism there is to be found\nin the Buddha myth, as well as in the birth legend of Christ, besides\nthe impregnation by star and wind, also the fertilization by an animal,\nhere an elephant, which with its phallic trunk fulfilled in Maya the\nChristian method of fructification through the ear or the head.",
    "It is\nwell known that, in addition to the dove, the unicorn is also a\nprocreative symbol of the Logos.",
    "Here arises the question why the birth of a hero always had to take\nplace under such strange symbolic circumstances?",
    "It might also be\nimagined that a hero arose from ordinary surroundings and gradually grew\nout of his inferior environment, perhaps with a thousand troubles and\ndangers.",
    "(And, indeed, this motive is by no means strange in the hero\nmyth.)",
    "It might be said that superstition demands strange conditions of\nbirth and generation; but why does it demand them?",
    "The answer to this question is: that the birth of the hero, as a rule,\nis not that of an ordinary mortal, but is a rebirth from the\nmother-spouse; hence it occurs under mysterious ceremonies.",
    "Therefore,\nin the very beginning, lies the motive of the two mothers of the hero.\n",
    "As Rank[639] has shown us through many examples, the hero is often\nobliged to experience exposure, and upbringing by foster parents, and in\nthis manner he acquires the two mothers.",
    "A striking example is the\nrelation of Hercules to Hera.",

    "The twofold mother may be\nreplaced by the motive of twofold birth, which has attained a lofty\nsignificance in the Christian mythology; namely, through baptism, which,\nas we have seen, represents rebirth.",
    "Thus man is born not merely in a\ncommonplace manner, but also born again in a mysterious manner, by means\nof which he becomes a participator of the kingdom of God, of\nimmortality.",
    "Any one may become a hero in this way who is generated anew\nthrough his own mother, because only through her does he share in\nimmortality.",
    "Therefore, it happened that the death of Christ on the\ncross, which creates universal salvation, was understood as “baptism”;\nthat is to say, as rebirth through the second mother, the mysterious\ntree of death.",
    "Christ says:",
    "“But I have a baptism to be baptized with: and how am I straitened\n  till it be accomplished!”—_Luke_ xii: 50.",
    "He interprets his death agony symbolically as birth agony.",
    "The motive of the two mothers suggests the thought of self-rejuvenation,\nand evidently expresses the fulfilment of the wish that it _might be\npossible for the mother to bear me again_; at the same time, applied to\nthe heroes, it means one is a hero who is borne again by her who has\npreviously been his mother; that is to say, _a hero is he who may again\nproduce himself through his mother_.",
    "The countless suggestions in the history of the procreation of the\nheroes indicate the latter formulations.",
    "Hiawatha’s father first\noverpowered the mother under the symbol of the bear; then himself\nbecoming a god, he procreates the hero.",
    "What Hiawatha had to do as hero,\nNokomis hinted to him in the legend of the origin of the moon; he is\nforcibly to throw his mother upwards (or throw downwards?); then she\nwould become pregnant by this act of violence and could bring forth a\ndaughter.",
    "This rejuvenated mother would be allotted, according to the\nEgyptian rite, as a daughter-wife to the sun-god, the father of his\nmother, for self-reproduction.",

    "Over this relief stand the words INTROITUS SOLIS.",
    "Because the one born was his own procreator, the history of his\nprocreation is strangely concealed under symbolic events, which are\nmeant to conceal and deny it; hence the extraordinary assertion of the\nvirgin conception.",
    "This is meant to hide the incestuous impregnation.\n",
    "But do not let us forget that this naïve assertion plays an unusually\nimportant part in the ingenious symbolic bridge, which is to guide the\nlibido out from the incestuous bond to higher and more useful\napplications, which indicate a new kind of immortality; that is to say,\nimmortal work.",
    "The environment of Hiawatha’s youth is of importance:",
    "“By the shores of Gitche Gumee,\n                 By the shining Big-Sea-Water,\n                 Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,\n                 Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.\n                 ",
    "Dark behind it rose the forest,\n                 Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,\n                 Rose the firs with cones upon them.\n                 ",
    "Bright before it beat the water,\n                 Beat the clear and sunny water,\n                 Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.”",
    "In this environment Nokomis brought him up.",
    "Here she taught him the\nfirst words, and told him the first fairy tales, and the sounds of the\nwater and the wood were intermingled, so that the child learned not only\nto understand man’s speech, but also that of Nature:",
    "“At the door on summer evenings\n                Sat the little Hiawatha;\n                Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,\n                Heard the lapping of the water,\n                Sounds of music, words of wonder:\n                ‘Minne-wawa!’[641] said the pine-trees,\n                ‘Mudway-aushka!’[642] said the water.”",
    "Hiawatha hears human speech in the sounds of Nature; thus he understands\nNature’s speech.",
    "The wind says, “Wawa.”",
    "The cry of the wild goose is\n“Wawa.”",
    "Wah-wah-taysee means the small glowworm which enchants him.",
    "Thus\nthe poet paints most beautifully the gradual gathering of external\nnature into the compass of the subjective,[643] and the intimate\nconnection of the primary object to which the first lisping words were\napplied, and from which the first sounds were derived, with the\nsecondary object, the wider nature which usurps imperceptibly the\nmother’s place, and takes possession of those sounds heard first from\nthe mother, and also of those feelings which we all discover later in\nourselves in all the warm love of Mother Nature.",
    "The later blending,\nwhether pantheistic-philosophic or æsthetic, of the sentimental,\ncultured man with nature is, looked at retrospectively, a reblending\nwith the mother, who was our primary object, and with whom we truly were\nonce wholly one.[644]",
    "Therefore, it is not astonishing when we again see\nemerging in the poetical speech of a modern philosopher, Karl Joël, the\nold pictures which symbolize the unity with the mother, illustrated by\nthe confluence of subject and object.",
    "In his recent book, “Seele und\nWelt” (1912), Joël writes as follows, in the chapter called “Primal\nExperience”[645]:",
    "“I lay on the seashore, the shining waters glittering in my dreamy\n  eyes; at a great distance fluttered the soft breeze; throbbing,\n  shimmering, stirring, lulling to sleep comes the wave beat to the\n  shore—or to the ear?",
    "I know not.",
    "Distance and nearness become blurred\n  into one; without and within glide into each other.",
    "Nearer and nearer,\n  _dearer and more homelike sounds the beating of the waves_; now, like\n  a thundering pulse in my head it strikes, and now it beats over my\n  soul, devours it, embraces it, while it itself at the same time floats\n  out like the blue waste of waters.",
    "Yes, without and within are one.\n  ",
    "Glistening and foaming, flowing and fanning and roaring, the entire\n  symphony of the stimuli experienced sounds in one tone, all thought\n  becomes one thought, which becomes one with feeling; the world exhales\n  in the soul and the soul dissolves in the world.",
    "Our small life is\n  encircled by a great sleep—_the sleep of our cradle, the sleep of our\n  grave, the sleep of our home, from which we go forth in the morning,\n  to which we again return in the evening_; our life but the short\n  journey, the interval between the emergence from the original oneness\n  and the sinking back into it!",
    "Blue shimmers the infinite sea, wherein\n  dreams the jelly fish of the primitive life, toward which without\n  ceasing our thoughts hark back dimly through eons of existence.",
    "For\n  every happening entails a change and a guarantee of the unity of life.\n  ",
    "At that moment when they are no longer blended together, in that\n  instant man lifts his _head, blind and dripping, from the depths_ of\n  the stream of experience, from the oneness with the experience; at\n  that moment of parting when the unity of life in startled surprise\n  detaches the Change and holds it away from itself as something alien,\n  at this moment of alienation the aspects of the experience have been\n  substantialized into subject and object, and in that moment\n  consciousness is born.”",
    "Joël paints here, in unmistakable symbolism, the confluence of subject\nand object as the reunion of mother and child.",
    "The symbols agree with\nthose of mythology, even in their details.",
    "The encircling and devouring\nmotive is distinctly suggested.",
    "The sea, devouring the sun and giving\nbirth to it anew, is already an old acquaintance.",
    "The moment of the rise\nof consciousness, the separation of subject and object is a birth; truly\nphilosophical thought hangs with lame wings upon the few great primitive\npictures of human speech, above the simple, all-surpassing greatness of\nwhich no thought can rise.",
    "The idea of the jelly fish is not\n“accidental.”",
    "Once when I was explaining to a patient the maternal\nsignificance of water at this contact with the mother complex, she\nexperienced a very unpleasant feeling.",
    "“It makes me squirm,” she said,\n“as if I touched a jelly fish.”",
    "Here, too, the same idea!",
    "The blessed\nstate of sleep before birth and after death is, as Joël observed,\nsomething like old shadowy memories of that unsuspecting, thoughtless\nstate of early childhood, where as yet no opposition disturbed the\npeaceful flow of dawning life, to which the inner longing always draws\nus back again and again, and from which the active life must free itself\nanew with struggle and death, so that it may not be doomed to\ndestruction.",
    "Long before Joël, an Indian chieftain had said the same\nthing in similar words to one of the restless wise men:",
    "“Ah, my brother, you will never learn to know the happiness of\n  thinking nothing and doing nothing: this is next to sleep; this is the\n  most delightful thing there is.",
    "Thus we were before birth, thus we\n  shall be after death.",
    "”[646]",
    "We shall see in Hiawatha’s later fate how important his early\nimpressions are in his choice of a wife.",
    "Hiawatha’s first deed was to\nkill a roebuck with his arrow:",
    "“Dead he lay there in the forest,\n                   By the ford across the river.”",
    "This is typical of Hiawatha’s deeds.",
    "Whatever he kills, for the most\npart, lies _next to or in the water_, sometimes half in the water and\nhalf on the land.[647] It seems that this must well be so.",
    "The later\nadventures will teach us why this must be so.",
    "The buck was no ordinary\nanimal, but a magic one; that is to say, one with an additional\nunconscious significance.",
    "Hiawatha made for himself gloves and moccasins\nfrom its hide; the gloves imparted such strength to his arms that he\ncould crumble rocks to dust, and the moccasins had the virtue of the\nseven-league boots.",
    "By enwrapping himself in the buck’s skin he really\nbecame a giant.",
    "This motive, together with the death of the animal at\nthe ford,[648] in the water, reveals the fact that the parents are\nconcerned, whose gigantic proportions as compared with the child are of\ngreat significance in the unconscious.",
    "The “toys of giants” is a wish\ninversion of the infantile phantasy.",
    "The dream of an eleven-year-old\ngirl expresses this:",
    "“I am as high as a church steeple; then a policeman comes.",
    "I tell him,\n  ‘If you say anything, I will cut off your head.’”",
    "The “policeman,” as the analysis brought out, referred to the father,\nwhose gigantic size was over-compensated by the church steeple.",
    "In\nMexican human sacrifices, the gods were represented by criminals, who\nwere slaughtered, and flayed, and the Corybantes then clothed themselves\nin the bloody skins, in order to illustrate the resurrection of the\ngods.[649] (The snake’s casting of his skin as a symbol of\nrejuvenation.)",
    "Hiawatha has, therefore, conquered his parents, primarily the mother,\nalthough in the form of a male animal (compare the bear of Mudjekeewis);\nand from that comes his giant’s strength.",
    "He has taken on the parent’s\nskin and now has himself become a great man.",
    "Now he started forth to his\nfirst great battle to fight with the father Mudjekeewis, in order to\navenge his dead mother Wenonah.",
    "Naturally, under this figure of speech\nhides the thought that he slays the father, in order to take possession\nof the mother.",
    "Compare the battle of Gilgamesh with the giant Chumbaba\nand the ensuing conquest of Ishtar.",
    "The father, in the psychologic\nsense, merely represents the personification of the incest prohibition;\nthat is to say, resistance, which defends the mother.",
    "Instead of the\nfather, it may be a fearful animal (the great bear, the snake, the\ndragon, etc.) which must be fought and overcome.",
    "The hero is a hero\nbecause he sees in every difficulty of life resistance to the forbidden\ntreasure, and fights that resistance with the complete yearning which\nstrives towards the treasure, attainable with difficulty, or\nunattainable, the yearning which paralyzes and kills the ordinary man.",
    "Hiawatha’s father is Mudjekeewis, the west wind; the battle, therefore,\ntakes place in the west.",
    "Thence came life (impregnation of Wenonah);\nthence also came death (death of Wenonah).",
    "Hiawatha, therefore, fights\nthe typical battle of the hero for rebirth in the western sea, the\nbattle with the devouring terrible mother, this time in the form of the\nfather.",
    "Mudjekeewis, who himself had acquired a divine nature, through\nhis conquest of the bear, now is overpowered by his son:",
    "“Back retreated Mudjekeewis,\n                 ",
    "Rushing westward o’er the mountains,\n                 Stumbling westward down the mountains,\n                 Three whole days retreated fighting,\n                 Still pursued by Hiawatha\n                 ",
    "To the doorways of the West-Wind,\n                 ",
    "To the portals of the Sunset,\n                 To the earth’s remotest border,\n                 Where into the empty spaces\n                 Sinks the sun, as a flamingo\n                 Drops into her nest at nightfall.”",
    "The “three days” are a stereotyped form representing the stay in the sea\nprison of night.",
    "(Twenty-first until twenty-fourth of December.)",
    "Christ,\ntoo, remained three days in the underworld.",
    "“The treasure, difficult to\nattain,” is captured by the hero during this struggle in the west.",
    "In\nthis case the father must make a great concession to the son; he gives\nhim divine nature,[650] that very wind nature, the immortality of which\nalone protected Mudjekeewis from death.",
    "He says to his son:",
    "“I will share my kingdom with you,\n                   Ruler shall you be henceforward,\n                   Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,\n                   Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin.”",
    "That Hiawatha now becomes ruler of the home-wind has its close parallel\nin the Gilgamesh epic, where Gilgamesh finally receives the magic herb\nfrom the wise old Utnapishtim, who dwells in the West, which brings him\nsafe once more over the sea to his home; but this, when he is home\nagain, is retaken from him by a serpent.",
    "When one has slain the father, one can obtain possession of his wife,\nand when one has conquered the mother, one can free one’s self.",
    "On the return journey Hiawatha stops at the clever arrow-maker’s, who\npossesses a lovely daughter:",
    "“And he named her from the river,\n                   From the water-fall he named her,\n                   Minnehaha, Laughing Water.”",
    "When Hiawatha, in his earliest childhood dreaming, felt the sounds of\nwater and wind press upon his ears, he recognized in these sounds of\nnature the speech of his mother.",
    "The murmuring pine trees on the shore\nof the great sea, said “Minnewawa.”",
    "And above the murmuring of the winds\nand the splashing of the water he found his earliest childhood dreams\nonce again in a woman, “Minnehaha,” the laughing water.",
    "And the hero,\nbefore all others, finds in woman the mother, in order to become a child\nagain, and, finally, to solve the riddle of immortality.",
    "The fact that Minnehaha’s father is a skilful arrow-maker betrays him as\nthe father of the hero (and the woman he had with him as the mother).\n",
    "The father of the hero is very often a skilful carpenter, or other\nartisan.",
    "According to an Arabian legend, Tare,[651] Abraham’s father,\nwas a skilful master workman, who could carve arrows from any wood; that\nis to say, in the Arabian form of speech, he was a procreator of\nsplendid sons.[652]",
    "Moreover, he was a maker of images of gods.\n",
    "Tvashtar, Agni’s father, is the maker of the world, a smith and\ncarpenter, the discoverer of fire-boring.",

    "There the divine image was carved out of a tree trunk and then placed\nwithin the hollow of the tree.",
    "(Frazer: “Golden Bough,” Part IV.)",
    "In\nRigveda, the world was also hewn out of a tree by the world-sculptor.\n",
    "The idea that the hero is his own procreator[653] leads to the fact that\nhe is invested with paternal attributes, and reversedly the heroic\nattributes are given to the father.",
    "In Mânî there exists a beautiful\nunion of the motives.",
    "He accomplishes his great labors as a religious\nfounder, hides himself for years in a cave, he dies, is skinned, stuffed\nand hung up (hero).",
    "Besides he is an artist, and has a crippled foot.",
    "A\nsimilar union of motives is found in Wieland, the smith.",
    "Hiawatha kept silent about what he saw at the old arrow-maker’s on his\nreturn to Nokomis, and he did nothing further to win Minnehaha.",
    "But now\nsomething happened, which, if it were not in an Indian epic, would\nrather be sought in the history of a neurosis.",
    "Hiawatha introverted his\nlibido; that is to say, he fell into an extreme resistance against the\n“real sexual demand” (Freud); he built a hut for himself in the wood, in\norder to fast there and to experience dreams and visions.",
    "For the first\nthree days he wandered, as once in his earliest youth, through a forest\nand looked at all the animals and plants:",
    "“‘Master of life!’",
    "he cried, desponding,\n               ‘Must our lives depend on these things?’”",
    "The question whether our lives must depend upon “these things” is very\nstrange.",
    "It sounds as if life were derived from these things; that is to\nsay, from nature in general.",
    "Nature seems suddenly to have assumed a\nvery strange significance.",
    "This phenomenon can be explained only through\nthe fact that a great amount of libido was stored up and now is given to\nnature.",
    "As is well known, men of even dull and prosy minds, in the\nspringtime of love, suddenly become aware of nature, and even make poems\nabout it.",
    "But we know that libido, prevented from an actual way of\ntransference, always reverts to an earlier way of transference.\n",
    "Minnehaha, the laughing water, is so clearly an allusion to the mother\nthat the secret yearning of the hero for the mother is powerfully\ntouched.",
    "Therefore, without having undertaken anything, he goes home to\nNokomis; but there again he is driven away, because Minnehaha already\nstands in his path.",
    "He turns, therefore, even further away, into that early youthful period,\nthe tones of which recall Minnehaha most forcibly to his thoughts, where\nhe learnt to hear the mother-sounds in the sounds of nature.",
    "In this\nvery strange revival of the impressions of nature we recognize a\nregression to those earliest and strongest nature impressions which\nstand next to the subsequently extinguished, even stronger, impressions\nwhich the child received from the mother.",
    "The glamour of this feeling\nfor her is transferred to other objects of the childish environment\n(father’s house, playthings, etc.), from which later those magic\nblissful feelings proceed, which seem to be peculiar to the earliest\nchildish memories.",
    "When, therefore, Hiawatha hides himself in the lap of\nnature, it is really the mother’s womb, and it is to be expected that he\nwill emerge again new-born in some form.",
    "Before turning to this new creation arising from introversion, there is\nstill a further significance of the preceding question to be considered:\nwhether life is dependent upon “these things”?",
    "Life may depend upon\nthese things in the degree that they serve _for nourishment_.",
    "We must\ninfer in this case that suddenly the question of nutrition came very\nnear the hero’s heart.",
    "(This possibility will be thoroughly proven in\nwhat follows.)",
    "The question of nutrition, indeed, enters seriously into\nconsideration.",
    "First, because regression to the mother necessarily\nrevives that special path of transference; namely, that of nutrition\nthrough the mother.",
    "As soon as the libido regresses to the presexual\nstage, there we may expect to see the function of nutrition and its\nsymbols put in place of the sexual function.",
    "Thence is derived an\nessential root of the displacement from below upwards (Freud), because,\nin the presexual stage, the principal value belongs not to the genitals,\nbut to the mouth.",
    "Secondly, because the hero fasted, his hunger becomes\npredominant.",
    "Fasting, as is well known, is employed to silence\nsexuality; also, it expresses symbolically the resistance against\nsexuality, translated into the language of the presexual stage.",
    "On the\nfourth day of his fast the hero ceased to address himself to nature; he\nlay exhausted, with half-closed eyes, upon his couch, sunk deep in\ndreams, the picture of extreme introversion.",
    "We have already seen that, in such circumstances, an infantile internal\nequivalent for reality appears, in the place of external life and\nreality.",
    "This is also the case with Hiawatha:",
    "“And he saw a youth approaching,\n                Dressed in garments green and yellow,\n                Coming through the purple twilight,\n                Through the splendor of the sunset;\n                Plumes of green bent o’er his forehead,\n                And his hair was soft and golden.”",
    "This remarkable apparition reveals himself in the following manner to\nHiawatha:",
    "“From the Master of Life descending,\n                I, the friend of man, Mondamin,\n                Come to warn you and instruct you,\n                How by struggle and by labor\n                You shall gain what you have prayed for.\n                ",
    "Rise up from your bed of branches;\n                Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!”",
    "Mondamin is the maize: a god, who is eaten, arising from Hiawatha’s\nintroversion.",
    "His hunger, taken in a double sense, his longing for the\nnourishing mother, gives birth from his soul to another hero, the edible\nmaize, the son of the earth mother.",
    "Therefore, he again arises at\nsunset, symbolizing the entrance into the mother, and in the western\nsunset glow he begins again the mystic struggle with the self-created\ngod, the god who has originated entirely from the longing for the\nnourishing mother.",
    "The struggle is again the struggle for liberation\nfrom this destructive and yet productive longing.",
    "Mondamin is,\ntherefore, equivalent to the mother, and the struggle with him means the\noverpowering and impregnation of the mother.",
    "This interpretation is\nentirely proven by a myth of the Cherokees, “who invoke it (the maize)\nunder the name of ‘The Old Woman,’ in allusion to a myth that it sprang\nfrom the blood of an old woman killed by her disobedient sons”:[654]",
    "“Faint with famine, Hiawatha\n                  Started from his bed of branches,\n                  From the twilight of his wigwam\n                  Forth into the flush of sunset\n                  Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;\n                  At his touch he felt new courage\n                  Throbbing in his brain and bosom,\n                  Felt new life and hope and vigor\n                  Run through every nerve and fibre.”",
    "The battle at sunset with the god of the maize gives Hiawatha new\nstrength; and thus it must be, because the fight for the individual\ndepths, against the paralyzing longing for the mother, gives creative\nstrength to men.",
    "Here, indeed, is the source of all creation, but it\ndemands heroic courage to fight against these forces and to wrest from\nthem the “treasure difficult to attain.”",
    "He who succeeds in this has, in\ntruth, attained the best.",
    "Hiawatha wrestles with himself for his\ncreation.[655] The struggle lasts again the charmed three days.",
    "The\nfourth day, just as Mondamin prophesied, Hiawatha conquers him, and\nMondamin sinks to the ground in death.",
    "As Mondamin previously desired,\nHiawatha digs his grave in mother earth, and soon afterwards from this\ngrave the young and fresh maize grows for the nourishment of mankind.",
    "Concerning the thought of this fragment, we have therein a beautiful\nparallel to the mystery of Mithra, where first the battle of the hero\nwith his bull occurs.",
    "Afterwards Mithra carries in “transitus” the bull\ninto the cave, where he kills him.",
    "From this death all fertility grows,\nall that is edible.[656]",
    "The cave corresponds to the grave.",
    "The same\nidea is represented in the Christian mysteries, although generally in\nmore beautiful human forms.",
    "The soul struggle of Christ in Gethsemane,\nwhere he struggles with himself in order to complete his work, then the\n“transitus,” the carrying of the cross,[657] where he takes upon himself\nthe symbol of the destructive mother, and therewith takes himself to the\nsacrificial grave, from which, after three days, he triumphantly arises;\nall these ideas express the same fundamental thoughts.",
    "Also, the symbol\nof eating is not lacking in the Christian mystery.",
    "Christ is a god who\nis eaten in the Lord’s Supper.",
    "His death transforms him into bread and\nwine, which we partake of in grateful memory of his great deed.[658] The\nrelation of Agni to the Somadrink and that of Dionysus to wine[659] must\nnot be omitted here.",
    "An evident parallel is Samson’s rending of the\nlion, and the subsequent inhabitation of the dead lion by honey bees,\nwhich gives rise to the well-known German riddle:",
    "“Speise ging von dem Fresser und Süssigkeit von dem Starken (Food went\n  from the glutton and sweet from the strong).”[660]",
    "In the Eleusinian mysteries these thoughts seem to have played a rôle.\n",
    "Besides Demeter and Persephone, Iakchos is a chief god of the Eleusinian\ncult; he was the “puer æternus,” the eternal boy, of whom Ovid says the\nfollowing:",
    "“Tu puer æternus, tu formosissimus alto\n            Conspiceris cœlo tibi, cum sine cornibus astas,\n            Virgineum caput est,” etc.[661]",
    "In the great Eleusinian festival procession the image of Iakchos was\ncarried.",
    "It is not easy to say which god is Iakchos, possibly a boy, or\na new-born son, similar to the Etrurian Tages, who bears the surname\n“the freshly ploughed boy,” because, according to the myth, he arose\nfrom the furrow of the field behind the peasant, who was ploughing.",
    "This\nidea shows unmistakably the Mondamin motive.",
    "The plough is of well-known\nphallic meaning; the furrow of the field is personified by the Hindoos\nas woman.",
    "The psychology of this idea is that of a coitus, referred back\nto the presexual stage (stage of nutrition).",
    "The son is the edible fruit\nof the field.",
    "Iakchos passes, in part, as son of Demeter or of\nPersephone, also appropriately as consort of Demeter.",
    "(Hero as\nprocreator of himself.)",
    "He is also called τῆς Δήμητρος δαίμων (Δαίμων\nequals libido, also Mother libido.)",
    "He was identified with Dionysus,\nespecially with the Thracian Dionysus-Zagreus, of whom a typical fate of\nrebirth was related.",
    "Hera had goaded the Titans against Zagreus, who,\nassuming many forms, sought to escape them, until they finally took him\nwhen he had taken on the form of a bull.",
    "In this form he was killed\n(Mithra sacrifice) and dismembered, and the pieces were thrown into a\ncauldron; but Zeus killed the Titans by lightning, and swallowed the\nstill-throbbing heart of Zagreus.",
    "Through this act he gave him existence\nonce more, and Zagreus as Iakchos again came forth.",
    "Iakchos carries the torch, the phallic symbol of procreation, as Plato\ntestifies.",
    "In the festival procession, the sheaf of corn, the cradle of\nIakchos, was carried.",
    "(λῖκνον, mystica vannus Iacchi.)",
    "The Orphic\nlegend[662] relates that Iakchos was brought up by Persephone, when,\nafter three years’ slumber in the λῖκνον,[663] he awoke.",
    "This statement\ndistinctly suggests the Mondamin motive.",
    "The 20th of Boedromion (the\nmonth Boedromion lasts from about the 5th of September to the 5th of\nOctober) is called Iakchos, in honor of the hero.",
    "On the evening of this\nday the great torchlight procession took place on the seashore, in which\nthe quest and lament of Demeter was represented.",
    "The rôle of Demeter,\nwho, seeking her daughter, wanders over the whole earth without food or\ndrink, has been taken over by Hiawatha in the Indian epic.",
    "He turns to\nall created things without obtaining an answer.",
    "As Demeter first learns\nof her daughter from the subterranean Hecate, so does Hiawatha first\nfind the one sought for, Mondamin,[664] in the deepest introversion\n(descent to the mother).",
    "Hiawatha produces from himself, Mondamin, as a\nmother produces the son.",
    "The longing for the mother also includes the\nproducing mother (first devouring, then birth-giving).",
    "Concerning the\nreal contents of the mysteries, we learn through the testimony of Bishop\nAsterius, about 390 A.D., the following:",
    "“Is not there (in Eleusis) the gloomiest descent, and the most solemn\n  communion of the hierophant and the priestess; between him and her\n  alone?",
    "Are the torches not extinguished, and does not the vast\n  multitude regard as their salvation that which takes place between the\n  two in the darkness?”[665]",
    "That points undoubtedly to a ritual marriage, which was celebrated\nsubterraneously in mother earth.",
    "The Priestess of Demeter seems to be\nthe representative of the earth goddess, perhaps the furrow of the\nfield.[666]",
    "The descent into the earth is also the symbol of the\nmother’s womb, and was a widespread conception under the form of cave\nworship.",
    "Plutarch relates of the Magi that they sacrificed to Ahriman,\nεἰς τόπον ἀνήλιον.[667]",
    "Lukian lets the magician Mithrobarzanes εἰς\nχωρίον ἔρημον καὶ ὑλῶδες καὶ ἀνήλιον,[668] descend into the bowels of\nthe earth.",
    "According to the testimony of Moses of the Koran, the sister\nFire and the brother Spring were worshipped in Armenia in a cave.",

    "“I have fasted, I have drunk of the barleydrink, I have taken from the\n  chest and after I have labored, I have placed it back in the basket,\n  and from the basket into the chest.”",
    "The question as to what lay in the chest is explained in detail by\nDieterich.[671] The labor he considers a phallic activity, which the\nmystic has to perform.",
    "In fact, representations of the mystic basket are\ngiven, wherein lies a phallus surrounded by fruits.[672] Upon the\nso-called Lovatelli tomb vase, the sculptures of which are understood to\nbe Eleusinian ceremonies, it is shown how a mystic caressed the serpent\nentwining Demeter.",
    "The caressing of the fear animal indicates a\nreligious conquering of incest.[673]",
    "According to the testimony of\nClemens of Alexandria, a serpent was in the chest.",
    "The serpent in this\nconnection is naturally of phallic nature, the phallus which is\nforbidden in relation to the mother.",
    "Rohde mentions that in the\nArrhetophories, pastry, in the form of phalli and serpents, were thrown\ninto the cave near the Thesmophorion.",
    "This custom was a petition for the\nbestowal of children and harvest.[674] The snake also plays a large part\nin initiations under the remarkable title ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός.[675]\nClemens observes that the symbol of the Sabazios mysteries is ὁ διὰ\nκόλπων θεός, δράκων δὲ ἐστι καὶ οὗτος διελκόμενος τοῦ κόλπου τῶν\nτελουμένων.[676]",

    "In the Orphic Hymn 52, Bacchus is invoked by ὑποκόλπιε,[678] which\nindicates that the god enters into man as if through the female\ngenitals.[679]",
    "According to the testimony of Hippolytus, the hierophant\nin the mystery exclaimed ἱερον ἔτεκε πότνια κοῦρον, Βριμὼ βριμόν (the\nrevered one has brought forth a holy boy, Brimos from Brimo).",
    "This\nChristmas gospel, “Unto us a son is born,” is illustrated especially\nthrough the tradition[680] that the Athenians “secretly show to the\npartakers in the Epoptia, the great and wonderful and most perfect\nEpoptic mystery, _a mown stalk of wheat_.”[681]",
    "The parallel for the motive of death and resurrection is the motive of\nlosing and finding.",
    "The motive appears in religious rites in exactly the\nsame connection, namely, in spring festivities similar to the\nHierosgamos, where the image of the god was hidden and found again.",
    "It\nis an uncanonical tradition that Moses left his father’s house when\ntwelve years old to teach mankind.",
    "In a similar manner Christ is lost by\nhis parents, and they find him again as a teacher of wisdom, just as in\nthe Mohammedan legend Moses and Joshua lose the fish, and in his place\nChidher, the teacher of wisdom, appears (like the boy Jesus in the\ntemple); so does the corn god, lost and believed to be dead, suddenly\narise again from his mother into renewed youth.",

    "The libido of mankind is always in advance of his\nconsciousness; unless his libido calls him forth to new dangers he sinks\ninto slothful inactivity or, on the other hand, childish longing for the\nmother overcomes him at the summit of his existence, and he allows\nhimself to become pitifully weak, instead of striving with desperate\ncourage towards the highest.",
    "The mother becomes the demon, who summons\nthe hero to adventure, and who also places in his path the poisonous\nserpent, which will strike him.",
    "Thus Nokomis, in the ninth song, calls\nHiawatha, points with her hand to the west, where the sun sets in purple\nsplendor, and says to him:",
    "[Illustration: MATUTA, AN ETRUSCAN PIETÀ]",
    "“Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather,\n                Megissogwon, the Magician,\n                Manito of Wealth and Wampum,\n                Guarded by his fiery serpents,\n                Guarded by the black pitch-water.\n                You can see his fiery serpents,\n                The Kenabeek, the great serpents,\n                Coiling, playing in the water.”",
    "This danger lurking in the west is known to mean death, which no one,\neven the mightiest, escapes.",
    "This magician, as we learn, also killed the\nfather of Nokomis.",
    "Now she sends her son forth to avenge the father\n(Horus).",
    "Through the symbols attributed to the magician it may easily be\nrecognized what he symbolizes.",
    "Snake and water belong to the mother, the\nsnake as a symbol of the repressed longing for the mother, or, in other\nwords, as a symbol of resistance, encircles protectingly and defensively\nthe maternal rock, inhabits the cave, winds itself upwards around the\nmother tree and guards the precious hoard, the “mysterious” treasure.\n",
    "The black Stygian water is, like the black, muddy spring of Dhulqarnein,\nthe place where the sun dies and enters into rebirth, the maternal sea\nof death and night.",
    "On his journey thither Hiawatha takes with him the\nmagic oil of Mishe-Nahma, which helps his boat through the waters of\ndeath.",
    "(Also a sort of charm for immortality, like the dragon’s blood\nfor Siegfried, etc.)",
    "First, Hiawatha slays the great serpent.",
    "Of the “night journey in the\nsea” over the Stygian waters it is written:",
    "“All night long he sailed upon it,\n                 Sailed upon that sluggish water,\n                 Covered with its mould of ages,\n                 Black with rotting water-rushes,\n                 Rank with flags, and leaves of lilies,\n                 Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,\n                 Lighted by the shimmering moonlight\n                 And by will-o’-the-wisps illumined,\n                 Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,\n                 ",
    "In their weary night encampments.”",
    "The description plainly shows the character of a water of death.",
    "The\ncontents of the water point to an already mentioned motive, that of\nencoiling and devouring.",
    "It is said in the “Key to Dreams of\nJagaddeva”:[687]",
    "“Whoever in dreams surrounds his body with bast, creepers or ropes,\n  with snake-skins, threads, or tissues, dies.”",
    "I refer to the preceding arguments in regard to this.",
    "Having come into\nthe west land, the hero challenges the magician to battle.",
    "A terrible\nstruggle begins.",
    "Hiawatha is powerless, because Megissogwon is\ninvulnerable.",
    "At evening Hiawatha retires wounded, despairing for a\nwhile, in order to rest:",
    "“Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,\n                From whose branches trailed the mosses,\n                And whose trunk was coated over\n                With the Dead-man’s Moccasin-leather,\n                With the fungus white and yellow.”",
    "This protecting tree is described as coated over with the moccasin\nleather of the dead, the fungus.",
    "This investing of the tree with\nanthropomorphic attributes is also an important rite wherever tree\nworship prevails, as, for example, in India, where each village has its\nsacred tree, which is clothed and in general treated as a human being.\n",
    "The trees are anointed with fragrant waters, sprinkled with powder,\nadorned with garlands and draperies.",
    "Just as among men, the piercing of\nthe _ears was performed as an apotropaic charm against death, so does it\noccur with the holy tree_.",
    "Of all the trees of India there is none more\nsacred to the Hindoos than the Aswatha (Ficus religiosa).",
    "It is known to\nthem as Vriksha Raja (king of trees), Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesvar live\nin it, and the worship of it is the worship of the triad.",
    "Almost every\nIndian village has an Aswatha,[688] etc.",
    "This “village linden tree,”\nwell known to us, is here clearly characterized as the mother symbol; it\ncontains the three gods.",
    "Hence, when Hiawatha retires to rest under the pine-tree,[689] it is a\ndangerous step, because he resigns himself to the mother, whose garment\nis the garment of death (the devouring mother).",
    "As in the whale-dragon,\nthe hero also in this situation needs a “helpful bird”; that is to say,\nthe helpful animals, which represent the benevolent parents:",
    "“Suddenly from the boughs above him\n                 Sang the Mama, the woodpecker;\n                 ‘Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,\n                 ",
    "At the head of Megissogwon,\n                 Strike the tuft of hair upon it,\n                 At their roots the long black tresses;\n                 There alone can he be wounded.’”",
    "Now, amusing to relate, Mama hurried to his help.",
    "It is a peculiar fact\nthat the woodpecker was also the “Mama” of Romulus and Remus, who put\nnourishment into the mouths of the twins with his beak.[690] (Compare\nwith that the rôle of the vulture in Leonardo’s dream.",
    "The vulture is\nsacred to Mars, like the woodpecker.)",
    "With the maternal significance of\nthe woodpecker, the ancient Italian folk-superstition agrees: that from\nthe tree upon which this bird nested any nail which has been driven in\nwill soon drop out again.[691] The woodpecker owes its special\nsignificance to the circumstance that he _hammers holes into trees_.\n",
    "(“To drive nails in,” as above!)",
    "It is, therefore, understandable that\nhe was made much of in the Roman legend as an old king of the country, a\npossessor or ruler of the holy tree, the primitive image of the\nPaterfamilias.",
    "An old fable relates how Circe, the spouse of King Picus,\ntransformed him into the Picus Martius, the woodpecker.",
    "The sorceress is\nthe “new-creating mother,” who has “magic influence” upon the\nsun-husband.",
    "She kills him, transforms him into the soul-bird, the\nunfulfilled wish.",
    "Picus was also understood as the wood demon and\nincubus, as well as the soothsayer, all of which fully indicate the\nmother libido.[692] Picus was often placed on a par with Picumnus by the\nancients.",
    "Picumnus is the inseparable companion of Pilumnus, and both\nare actually called _infantium dii_, “the gods of little children.”\n",
    "Especially it was said of Pilumnus that he defended new-born children\nagainst the destroying attacks of the wood demon, Silvanus.",
    "(Good and\nbad mother, the motive of the two mothers.)",
    "The benevolent bird, a wish thought of deliverance which arises from\nintroversion,[693] advises the hero to shoot the magician under the\nhair, which is the only vulnerable spot.",
    "This spot is the “phallic”\npoint,[694] if one may venture to say so; it is at _the top of the\nhead_, at the _place where the mystic birth from the head takes place_,\nwhich even to-day appears in children’s sexual theories.",
    "Into that\nHiawatha shoots (one may say, very naturally) three arrows[695] (the\nwell-known phallic symbol), and thus kills Megissogwon.",
    "Thereupon he\nsteals the magic wampum armor, which renders him invulnerable (means of\nimmortality).",
    "He significantly leaves the dead lying in the\nwater—because the magician is the fearful mother:",
    "“On the shore he left the body,\n                   Half on land and half in water,\n                   In the sand his feet were buried,\n                   And his face was in the water.”",
    "Thus the situation is the same as with the fish king, because the\nmonster is the personification of the water of death, which in its turn\nrepresents the devouring mother.",
    "This great deed of Hiawatha’s, where he\nhas vanquished the mother as the death-bringing demon,[696] is followed\nby his marriage with Minnehaha.",
    "A little fable which the poet has inserted in the later song is\nnoteworthy.",
    "An old man is transformed into a youth, by _crawling through\na hollow oak tree_.",
    "In the fourteenth song is a description of how Hiawatha discovers\nwriting.",
    "I limit myself to the description of two hieroglyphic tokens:",
    "“Gitche Manito the Mighty,\n                  He, the Master of Life, was painted\n                  As an egg, with points projecting\n                  To the four winds of the heavens.\n                  ",
    "Everywhere is the Great Spirit,\n                  Was the meaning of this symbol.”",
    "The world lies in the egg, which encompasses it at every point; it is\nthe cosmic woman with child, the symbol of which Plato as well as the\nVedas has made use of.",
    "This mother is like the air, which is everywhere.\n",
    "But air is spirit; the mother of the world is a spirit:",
    "“Mitche Manito the Mighty,\n                    He the dreadful Spirit of Evil,\n                    As a serpent was depicted,\n                    As Kenabeek, the great serpent.”",
    "But the spirit of evil is fear, is the forbidden desire, the adversary\nwho opposes not only each individual heroic deed, but life in its\nstruggle for eternal duration as well, and who introduces into our body\nthe poison of weakness and age through the treacherous bite of the\nserpent.",
    "It is all that is retrogressive, and as the model of our first\nworld is our mother, all retrogressive tendencies are towards the\nmother, and, therefore, are disguised under the incest image.",
    "In both these ideas the poet has represented in mythologic symbols the\nlibido arising from the mother and the libido striving backward towards\nthe mother.",
    "There is a description in the fifteenth song how Chibiabos, Hiawatha’s\nbest friend, the amiable player and singer, the embodiment of the joy of\nlife, was enticed by the evil spirits into ambush, fell through the ice\nand was drowned.",
    "Hiawatha mourns for him so long that he succeeds, with\nthe aid of the magician, in calling him back again.",
    "But the revivified\nfriend is only a spirit, and he becomes master of the land of spirits.\n",
    "(Osiris, lord of the underworld; the two Dioscuri.)",
    "Battles again\nfollow, and then comes the loss of a second friend, Kwasind, the\nembodiment of physical strength.",
    "In the twentieth song occur famine and the death of Minnehaha, foretold\nby two taciturn guests from the land of death; and in the twenty-second\nsong Hiawatha prepares for a final journey to the west land:",
    "“I am going, O Nokomis,\n                 On a long and distant journey,\n                 To the portals of the Sunset,\n                 To the regions of the home-wind,\n                 Of the Northwest-Wind Keewaydin.",
    "“One long track and trail of splendor,\n                 Down whose stream, as down a river,\n                 Westward, westward, Hiawatha\n                 Sailed into the fiery sunset,\n                 Sailed into the purple vapors,\n                 Sailed into the dusk of evening.",
    "“Thus departed Hiawatha,\n                 Hiawatha the Beloved,\n                 In the glory of the sunset,\n                 In the purple mists of evening,\n                 To the regions of the home-wind,\n                 Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,\n                 To the Islands of the Blessed,\n                 To the kingdom of Ponemah,\n                 To the land of the Hereafter!”",
    "The sun, victoriously arising, tears itself away from the embrace and\nclasp, from the enveloping womb of the sea, and sinks again into the\nmaternal sea, into night, the all-enveloping and the all-reproducing,\nleaving behind it the heights of midday and all its glorious works.",
    "This\nimage was the first, and was profoundly entitled to become the symbolic\ncarrier of human destiny; in the morning of life man painfully tears\nhimself loose from the mother, from the domestic hearth, to rise through\nbattle to his heights.",
    "Not seeing his worst enemy in front of him, but\nbearing him within himself as a deadly longing for the depths within,\nfor drowning in his own source, for becoming absorbed into the mother,\nhis life is a constant struggle with death, a violent and transitory\ndelivery from the always lurking night.",
    "This death is no external enemy,\nbut a deep personal longing for quiet and for the profound peace of\nnon-existence, for a dreamless sleep in the ebb and flow of the sea of\nlife.",
    "Even in his highest endeavor for harmony and equilibrium, for\nphilosophic depths and artistic enthusiasm, he seeks death, immobility,\nsatiety and rest.",
    "If, like Peirithoos, he tarries too long in this place\nof rest and peace, he is overcome by torpidity, and the poison of the\nserpent paralyzes him for all time.",
    "If he is to live he must fight and\nsacrifice his longing for the past, in order to rise to his own heights.\n",
    "And having reached the noonday heights, he must also _sacrifice the love\nfor his own achievement_, for he may not loiter.",
    "The sun also sacrifices\nits greatest strength in order to hasten onwards to the fruits of\nautumn, which are the seeds of immortality; fulfilled in children, in\nworks, in posthumous fame, in a new order of things, all of which in\ntheir turn begin and complete the sun’s course over again.",
    "The “Song of Hiawatha” contains, as these extracts show, a material\nwhich is very well adapted to bring into play the abundance of ancient\nsymbolic possibilities, latent in the human mind, and to stimulate it to\nthe creation of mythologic figures.",
    "But the products always contain the\nsame old problems of humanity, which rise again and again in new\nsymbolic disguise from the shadowy world of the unconscious.",
    "Thus Miss\nMiller is reminded through the longing of Chiwantopel, of another mythic\ncycle which appeared in the form of Wagner’s “Siegfried.”",
    "Especially is\nthis shown in the passage in Chiwantopel’s monologue, where he exclaims,\n“There is not one who understands me, not one who resembles me, not one\nwho has a soul sister to mine.”",
    "Miss Miller observes that the sentiment\nof this passage has the greatest analogy with the feelings which\nSiegfried experienced for Brunhilde.",
    "This analogy causes us to cast a glance at the song of Siegfried,\nespecially at the relation of Siegfried and Brunhilde.",
    "It is a\nwell-recognized fact that Brunhilde, the Valkyr, gives protection to the\nbirth (incestuous) of Siegfried, but while Sieglinde is the human\nmother, Brunhilde has the rôle of “spiritual mother” (mother-imago);\nhowever, unlike Hera towards Hercules, she is not a pursuer, but\nbenevolent.",
    "This sin, in which she is an accomplice, by means of the\nhelp she renders, is the reason for her banishment by Wotan.",
    "The strange\nbirth of Siegfried from the sister-wife distinguishes him as Horus, as\nthe _reborn son_, a reincarnation of the retreating Osiris—Wotan.",
    "The\nbirth of the young son, of the hero, results, indeed, from mankind, who,\nhowever, are merely the human bearers of the cosmic symbolism.",
    "Thus the\nbirth is protected by the spirit mother (Hera, Lilith): she sends\nSieglinde with the child in her womb (Mary’s flight) on the “night\njourney on the sea” to the east:",
    "“Onward, hasten;\n                    Turn to the East.",

    "The motive of dismemberment is found again in the broken sword of\nSiegmund, which was kept for Siegfried.",
    "From the dismemberment life is\npieced together again.",
    "(The Medea wonder.)",
    "Just as a smith forges the\npieces together, so is the dismembered dead again put together.",
    "(This\ncomparison is also found in “Timaios” of Plato: the parts of the world\njoined together with pegs.)",
    "In the Rigveda, 10, 72, the creator of the\nworld, Brahmanaspati, is a smith.",
    "“Brahmanaspati, as a blacksmith,\n                    Welded the world together.”",
    "The sword has the significance of the phallic sun power; therefore, a\nsword proceeds from the mouth of the apocalyptic Christ; that is to say,\nthe procreative fire, the word, or the procreative Logos.",
    "In Rigveda,\nBrahmanaspati is also a prayer-word, which possessed an ancient creative\nsignificance:[697]",
    "“And this prayer of the singers, expanding from itself,\n        Became a cow, which was already there before the world,\n        Dwelling together in the womb of this god,\n        Foster-children of the same keeper are the gods.”",
    "—_Rigveda_ x: 31.",
    "The Logos became a cow; that is to say, the mother, who is pregnant with\nthe gods.",
    "(In Christian uncanonical phantasies, where the Holy Ghost has\nfeminine significance, we have the well-known motive of the two mothers,\nthe earthly mother, Mary, and the spiritual mother, the Holy Ghost.)",
    "The\ntransformation of the Logos into the mother is not remarkable in itself,\nbecause the origin of the phenomenon fire-speech seems to be the\nmother-libido, according to the discussion in the earlier chapter.",
    "The\n_spiritual is the mother-libido_.",
    "The significance of the sword, in the\nSanskrit conception, têjas, is probably partly determined by its\nsharpness, as is shown above, in its connection with the libido\nconception.",
    "The motive of pursuit (the pursuing Sieglinde, analogous to\nLeto) is not here bound up with the spiritual mother, but with Wotan,\ntherefore corresponding to the Linos legend, where the father of the\nwife is also the pursuer.",
    "Wotan is also the father of Brunhilde.\n",
    "Brunhilde stands in a peculiar relation to Wotan.",

    "I take counsel only with myself, When I speak with thee....",
    "Brunhilde is also somewhat the “angel of the face,” that creative will\nor word,[698] emanating from God, also the Logos, which became the\nchild-bearing woman.",
    "God created the world through his word; that is to\nsay, his mother, the woman who is to bring him forth again.",
    "(He lays his\nown egg.)",
    "This peculiar conception, it seems to me, can be explained by\nassuming that the libido overflowing into speech (thought) has preserved\nits sexual character to an extraordinary degree as a result of the\ninherent inertia.",
    "In this way the “word” had to execute and fulfil all\nthat was denied to the sexual wish; namely, the return into the mother,\nin order to attain eternal duration.",
    "The “word” fulfils this wish by\nitself becoming the daughter, the wife, the mother of the God, who\nbrings him forth anew.[699]",
    "Wagner has this idea vaguely in his mind in Wotan’s lament over\nBrunhilde:",
    "“None as she knew my inmost thought;\n                  None knew the source of my will\n                  As she;\n                  She herself was\n                  The creating womb of my wish;\n                  ",
    "And so now she has broken\n                  The blessed union!”",
    "Brunhilde’s sin is the favoring of Siegmund, but, behind this, lies\nincest: this is projected into the brother-sister relation of Siegmund\nand Sieglinde; in reality, and archaically expressed, Wotan, the father,\nhas entered into his self-created daughter, in order to rejuvenate\nhimself.",
    "But this fact must, of course, be veiled.",
    "Wotan is rightly\nindignant with Brunhilde, for she has taken the Isis rôle and through\nthe birth of the son has deprived the old man of his power.",
    "The first\nattack of the death serpent in the form of the son, Siegmund, Wotan has\nrepelled; he has broken Siegmund’s sword, but Siegmund rises again in a\ngrandson.",

    "The\nfoster-mother[700] is apparently not a woman, but a chthonic god, a\ncrippled dwarf, who belongs to that tribe which renounces love.[701] The\nEgyptian god of the underworld, the crippled shadow of Osiris (who\ncelebrated a melancholy resurrection in the sexless semi-ape\nHarpocrates), is the tutor of Horus, who has to avenge the death of his\nfather.",
    "Meanwhile Brunhilde sleeps the enchanted sleep, like a Hierosgamos, upon\na mountain, where Wotan has put her to sleep[702] with the magic thorn\n(Edda), surrounded by the flames of Wotan’s fire (equal to libido[703]),\nwhich wards off every one.",

    "The chthonic god was probably\nalways a serpent dwelling in a cave, and was fed with πελανοί.[741] In\nthe Asclepiadean of the later period, the sacred serpents were scarcely\nvisible, meaning that they probably existed only figuratively.[742]\nNothing was left but the hole in which the snake was said to dwell.\n",

    "This assertion of the hero’s, that he has remained\ninviolate, refers back to the unsuccessful attempt upon his life in the\nprevious chapter (huntsman with the arrow), and clearly explains to us\nwhat was really meant by this assault; that is to say, the refusal of\nthe coitus phantasy.",
    "Here the wish of the unconscious obtrudes itself\nagain, after the hero had repressed it the first time, and thereupon he\npainfully and hysterically utters this monologue.",
    "“Temptation will often\nassail her soul—but it will not yield.”",

    "The orgiastic “Occide moriturus” in its admixture with the\nreckless laughter of the Dionysian frenzy confronts us here in sorry\ndisguise with a sentimental stage trickery worthy of our posthumous\nedition of “Christian morals.”",

    "This\nend means that the mother, represented as the jaws of death, devours the\nlibido of the daughter.",
    "Therefore, instead of life and procreative\ngrowth, only phantastic self-oblivion results.",
    "This weak and inglorious\nend has no elevating or illuminating meaning so long as we consider it\nmerely as the solution of an individual erotic conflict.",
    "The fact that\nthe symbols under which the solution takes place have actually a\nsignificant aspect, reveals to us that behind the individual mask,\nbehind the veil of “individuation,” a primitive idea stands, the severe\nand serious features of which take from us the courage to consider the\nsexual meaning of the Miller symbolism as all-sufficient.",
    "It is not to be forgotten that the _sexual phantasies of the neurotic\nand the exquisite sexual language of dreams_ are regressive phenomena.\n",
    "The sexuality of the unconscious is not what it seems to be; _it is\nmerely a symbol_; it is a thought bright as day, clear as sunlight, a\ndecision, a step forward to every goal of life—but expressed in the\nunreal sexual language of the unconscious, and in the thought form of an\nearlier stage; a resurrection, so to speak, of earlier modes of\nadaptation.",
    "When, therefore, the unconscious pushes into the foreground\nthe coitus wish, negatively expressed, it means somewhat as follows:\nunder similar circumstances primitive man acted in such and such a\nmanner.",
    "The mode of adaptation which to-day is unconscious for us is\ncarried on by the savage Negro of the present day, whose undertakings\nbeyond those of nutrition appertain to sexuality, characterized by\nviolence and cruelty.",
    "Therefore, in view of the archaic mode of\nexpression of the Miller phantasy, we are justified in assuming the\ncorrectness of our interpretation for the lowest and nearest plane only.\n",
    "A deeper stratum of meaning underlies the earlier assertion that the\nfigure of Chiwantopel has the character of Cassius, who has a lamb as a\ncompanion.",
    "Therefore, Chiwantopel is the portion of the dreamer’s libido\nbound up with the mother (and, therefore, masculine); hence he is her\ninfantile personality, the childishness of character, which as yet is\nunable to understand that one must leave father and mother, when the\ntime is come, in order to serve the destiny of the entire personality.\n",
    "This is outlined in Nietzsche’s words:",

    "Art thou one who had the right\n  to throw off a yoke?",
    "There are many who throw away their last value\n  when they throw away their servitude.”",
    "Therefore, when Chiwantopel dies, it means that herein is a fulfilment\nof a wish, that this infantile hero, who cannot leave the mother’s care,\nmay die.",

    "we so dearly love.",
    "Nor does it help if we cry out with the\nmelancholy hero Chiwantopel, “I have kept my body inviolate”; flight\nfrom life does not free us from the law of age and death.",
    "The neurotic\nwho seeks to get rid of the necessities of life wins nothing and lays\nupon himself the frightful burden of a premature age and death, which\nmust appear especially cruel on account of the total emptiness and\nmeaninglessness of his life.",
    "If the libido is not permitted to follow\nthe progressive life, which is willing to accept all dangers and all\nlosses, then it follows the other road, sinking into its own depths,\nworking down into the old foreboding regarding the immortality of all\nlife, to the longing for rebirth.",

    "“... Above and around are reared\n            The summits of Time,\n            And the loved ones, though near,\n            Live on deeply separated mountains.\n            ",

    "Here the one\nwho descends drinks the waters of innocence, the waters of childhood,\nthe drink of rejuvenation,[797] so wings may grow, and, winged, he may\nsoar up again into life, like the winged sun, which arises like a swan\nfrom the water (“Wings, to pass across and to return again”):",

    "The passage from Asia through Patmos to the Christian mysteries in the\npoem of Hölderlin is apparently a superficial connection, but in reality\na very ingenious train of thought; namely, the entrance into death and\nthe land beyond as a self-sacrifice of the hero, for the attainment of\nimmortality.",

    "This recognition, that man must sacrifice the retrogressive longing (the\nincestuous libido) before the “heavenly ones” tear away the sacrifice,\nand at the same time the entire libido, came too late to the poet.\n",
    "Therefore, I take it to be a wise counsel which the unconscious gives\nour author, to sacrifice the infantile hero.",
    "This sacrifice is best\naccomplished, as is shown by the most obvious meaning, through a\ncomplete devotion to life, in which all the libido unconsciously bound\nup in familial bonds, must be brought outside into human contact.",
    "For it\nis necessary for the well-being of the adult individual, who in his\nchildhood was merely an atom revolving in a rotary system, to become\nhimself the centre of a new system.",
    "That such a step implies the\nsolution or, at least, the energetic treatment of the individual sexual\nproblem is obvious, for unless this is done the unemployed libido will\ninexorably remain fixed in the incestuous bond, and will prevent\nindividual freedom in essential matters.",
    "Let us keep in mind that\nChrist’s teaching separates man from his family without consideration,\nand in the talk with Nicodemus we saw the specific endeavor of Christ to\nprocure activation of the incest libido.",
    "Both tendencies serve the same\ngoal—the liberation of man; the Jew from his extraordinary fixation to\nthe family, which does not imply higher development, but greater\nweakness and more uncontrolled incestuous feeling, produced the\ncompensation of the compulsory ceremonial of the cult and the religious\nfear of the incomprehensible Jehovah.",
    "When man, terrified by no laws and\nno furious fanatics or prophets, allows his incestuous libido full play,\nand does not liberate it for higher purposes, then he is under the\ninfluence of unconscious compulsion.",
    "For compulsion is the unconscious\nwish.",
    "(Freud.)",
    "He is under the dominance of the libido εἱμαρμένη[803]\nand his destiny does not lie in his own hands; his adventures, Τύχαι καὶ\nΜοῖραι,[804] fall from the stars.",
    "His unconscious incestuous libido,\nwhich thus is applied in its most primitive form, fixes the man, as\nregards his love type, in a corresponding primitive stage, the stage of\nungovernableness and surrender to the emotions.",
    "Such was the psychologic\nsituation of the passing antiquity, and the Redeemer and Physician of\nthat time was he who endeavored to educate man to the sublimation of the\nincestuous libido.[805]",
    "The destruction of slavery was the necessary\ncondition of that sublimation, for antiquity had not yet recognized the\nduty of work and work as a duty, as a social need of fundamental\nimportance.",
    "Slave labor was compulsory work, the counterpart of the\nequally disastrous compulsion of the libido of the privileged.",
    "It was\nonly the obligation of the individual to work which made possible in the\nlong run that regular “drainage” of the unconscious, which was inundated\nby the continual regression of the libido.",
    "Indolence is the beginning of\nall vice, because in a condition of slothful dreaming the libido has\nabundant opportunity for sinking into itself, in order to create\ncompulsory obligations by means of regressively reanimated incestuous\nbonds.",
    "The best liberation is through _regular work_.[806] Work,\nhowever, is salvation only when it is a free act, and has in itself\nnothing of infantile compulsion.",
    "In this respect, religious ceremony\nappears in a high degree as organized inactivity, and at the same time\nas the forerunner of modern work.",
    "Miss Miller’s vision treats the problem of the sacrifice of the\ninfantile longing, in the first place, as an individual problem, but if\nwe cast a glance at the form of this presentation, then we will become\naware that here it must concern something, which is also a problem of\nhumanity in general.",
    "For the symbols employed, the serpent which killed\nthe horse[807] and the hero voluntarily sacrificing himself, are\nprimitive figures of phantasies and religious myths streaming up from\nthe unconscious.",
    "In so far as the world and all within it is, above all, a thought, which\nis credited with transcendental “substance” through the empirical need\nof the same, there results from the sacrifice of the regressive libido\nthe creation of the world; and, psychologically speaking, the world in\ngeneral.",
    "For him who looks backward the world, and even the infinite\nstarry sky, is the mother[808] who bends over and encloses him on all\nsides, and from the renunciation of this idea and from the longing for\nthis idea arises the image of the world.",
    "From this most simple\nfundamental thought, which perhaps appears strange to us only because it\nis conceived according to the _principle of desire and not the principle\nof reality_,[809] results the significance of the cosmic sacrifice.",
    "A\ngood example of this is the slaying of the Babylonian primitive mother\nTiâmat, the dragon, whose body is destined to form the heaven and the\nearth.",
    "We come upon this thought in its most complete form in Hindoo\nphilosophy of the most ancient date; namely, in songs of Rigveda.",
    "In\nRigveda 10: 81, 4, the song inquires:",
    "“What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they\n    fashioned out the earth and heaven?\n ",
    "Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit, whereon he stood when he\n    established all things.”",
    "Viçvakarman, the All-Creator, who created the world from the unknown\ntree, did so as follows:",

    "Rigveda 10: 90, gives answer to these questions.",
    "Purusha is the primal\nbeing who",
    "“... covered earth on every side and\n                  Spread ten fingers’ breadth beyond.”",
    "One sees that Purusha is a sort of Platonic world soul, who surrounds\nthe world from without.",
    "Of Purusha it is said:",
    "“Being born he overtopped the earth\n                  Before, behind, and in all places.”",
    "The mother symbolism is plain, it seems to me, in the idea of Purusha.\n",
    "He represents the mother-imago and the libido of the child clinging to\nher.",
    "From this assumption all that follows is very easily explained:",
    "“As sacrificial animal on the bed of straw\n               Was dedicated the Purusha,\n               Who was born on the straw,\n               Whom the Gods, the Blest, and the Wise,\n               Meeting there, sacrificed.”",
    "This verse is very remarkable; if one wishes to stretch this mythology\nout on the procrustean bed of logic, sore violence would have to be\ncommitted.",
    "It is an incredibly phantastic conception that, beside the\ngods, ordinary “wise men” unite in sacrificing the primitive being,\naside from the circumstance that, beside the primitive being, nothing\nhad existed in the beginning (that is to say, before the sacrifice), as\nwe shall soon see.",
    "If the great mystery of the mother sacrifice is meant\nthereby, then all becomes clear:",
    "“From that great general sacrifice\n               The dripping fat was gathered up.\n               ",
    "He formed the creatures of the air,\n               And animals both wild and tame.\n               ",
    "From that great general sacrifice\n               Richas and Sama-hymns were born;\n               Therefrom the metres were produced,\n               The Yajus had its birth from it.",

    "“Forth from his navel came midair;\n               The sky was fashioned from his head;\n               Earth from his feet, and from his ears\n               The regions.",
    "Thus they formed the worlds.”",
    "It is evident that by this is meant not a physical, but a psychological\ncosmogony.",
    "The world arises when man discovers it.",
    "He discovers it when\nhe sacrifices the mother; that is to say, when he has freed himself from\nthe midst of his unconscious lying in the mother.",
    "That which impels him\nforward to this discovery may be interpreted psychologically as the\nso-called “Incest barrier” of Freud.",
    "The incest prohibition places an\nend to the childish longing for the food-giving mother, and compels the\nlibido, gradually becoming sexual, into the path of the biological aim.\n",
    "The libido forced away from the mother by the incest prohibition seeks\nfor the sexual object in the place of the forbidden mother.",
    "In this\nwider psychologic sense, which expresses itself in the allegoric\nlanguage of the “incest prohibition,” “mother,” etc., must be understood\nFreud’s paradoxical sentence, “Originally we have known only sexual\nobjects.",
    "”[811]",
    "This sentence must be understood psychologically\nthroughout, in the sense of a world image created from within outwards,\nwhich has, in the first place, nothing to do with the so-called\n“objective” idea of the world.",
    "This is to be understood as a new edition\nof the subjective idea of the world corrected by reality.",
    "Biology, as a\nscience of objective experience, would have to reject unconditionally\nFreud’s proposition, for, as we have made clear above, the function of\nreality can only be partly sexual; in another equally important part it\nis self-preservation.",
    "The matter appears different for that thought\nwhich accompanies the biological function as an epiphenomenon.",
    "As far as\nour knowledge reaches, the individual act of thought is dependent wholly\nor in greatest part on the existence of a highly differentiated brain,\nwhereas the function of reality (adaptation to reality) is something\nwhich occurs in all living nature as wholly independent from the act of\nthought.",
    "This important proposition of Freud’s applies only to the act\nof thought, for thinking, as we may recognize from manifold traces,\narose dynamically from the libido, which was split off from the original\nobject at the “incest barrier” and became actual when the first budding\nsexual emotions began to flow in the current of the libido which goes to\nthe mother.",
    "Through the incest barrier the sexual libido is forced away\nfrom the identification with the parents, and introverted for lack of\nadequate activity.",
    "It is the sexual libido which forces the growing\nindividual slowly away from his family.",
    "If this necessity did not exist,\nthen the family would always remain clustered together in a solid group.\n",
    "Hence the neurotic always renounces a complete erotic experience,[812]\nin order that he may remain a child.",
    "Phantasies seem to arise from the\nintroversion of the sexual libido.",
    "Since the first childish phantasies\nmost certainly do not attain the quality of a conscious plan, and as\nphantasies likewise (even among adults) are almost always the direct\nderivates of the unconscious, it is, therefore, highly probable that the\nfirst phantastic manifestations arise from an act of regression.",
    "As we\nillustrated earlier, the regression goes back to the presexual stage, as\nmany traces show.",
    "Here the sexual libido obtains again, so to speak,\nthat universal capacity of application, or capacity for displacement,\nwhich it actually possessed at that stage when the sexual application\nwas not yet discovered.",
    "Naturally, no adequate object is found in the\npresexual stage for the regressive sexual libido, but only surrogates,\nwhich always leave a wish; namely, the wish to have the surrogate as\nsimilar as possible to the sexual goal.",
    "This wish is secret, however,\nfor it is really an incest wish.",
    "The unsatisfied unconscious wish\ncreates innumerable secondary objects, symbols for the primitive object,\nthe mother (as the Rigveda says, the creator of the world, “hiding his\norigin,” enters into things).",
    "From this the thought or the phantasies\nproceed, as a desexualized manifestation of _an originally sexual\nlibido_.",
    "From the standpoint of the libido, the term “incest barrier” corresponds\nto one aspect, but the matter, however, may be considered from another\npoint of view.",
    "The time of undeveloped sexuality, about the third and the fourth year,\nis, at the same time, considered externally, the period when the child\nfinds himself confronted with increased demands from the world of\nreality.",
    "He can walk, speak and independently attend to a number of\nother things.",
    "He sees himself in a relation to a world of unlimited\npossibilities, but in which he dares to do little or nothing, because he\nis as yet too much of a baby and cannot get on without his mother.",
    "At\nthis time mother should be exchanged for the world.",
    "Against this the\npast rises as the greatest resistance; this is always so whenever man\nwould undertake a new adaptation.",
    "In spite of all evidence and against\nall conscious resolutions, the unconscious (the past) always enforces\nits standpoint as resistance.",
    "In this difficult position, precisely at\nthis period of developing sexuality, we see the dawning of the mind.",
    "The\nproblem of the child at this period is the discovery of the world and of\nthe great transsubjective reality.",
    "For that he must lose the mother;\nevery step out into the world means a step away from the mother.\n",
    "Naturally, all that which is retrogressive in men rebels against this\nstep, and energetic attempts are made against this adaptation in the\nfirst place.",
    "Therefore, this period of life is also that in which the\nfirst clearly developed neuroses arise.",
    "The tendency of this age is one\ndirectly opposed to that of dementia præcox.",
    "The child seeks to win the\nworld and to leave the mother (this is a necessary result).",
    "The dementia\npræcox patient, however, seeks to leave the world and to regain the\nsubjectivity of childhood.",
    "We have seen that in dementia præcox the\nrecent adaptation to reality is replaced by an archaic mode of\nadaptation; that is to say, the recent idea of the world is rejected in\nfavor of an archaic idea of the world.",
    "When the child renounces his task\nof adaptation to reality, or has considerable difficulties in this\ndirection, then we may expect that the recent adaptation will again be\nreplaced by archaic modes of adaptation.",
    "It would, therefore, be\nconceivable that through regression in children archaic products would\nnaturally be unearthed; that is to say, old ways of functioning of the\nthought system, which is inborn with the brain differentiation, would be\nawakened.",
    "According to my available but as yet unpublished material, a remarkably\narchaic and at the same time generally applicable character seems to\nappertain to infantile phantasy, quite comparable with the products of\ndementia præcox.",
    "It does not seem improbable that through regression at\nthis age those same associations of elements and analogies are\nreawakened which formerly constituted the archaic idea of the world.\n",
    "When we now attempt to investigate the nature of these elements, a\nglance at the psychology of myths is sufficient to show us that the\narchaic idea was chiefly sexual anthropomorphism.",
    "It appears that these\nthings in the unconscious childish phantasy play an extraordinary rôle,\nas we can recognize from examples taken at random.",
    "Just as the sexualism\nof neuroses is not to be taken literally but as regressive phantasy and\nsymbolic compensation for a recent unachieved adaptation, so is the\nsexualism of the early infantile phantasy, especially the incest\nproblem, a regressive product of the revival of the archaic modes of\nfunction, outweighing actuality.",
    "On this account I have expressed myself\nvery vaguely in this work, I am sure, in regard to the incest problem.\n",
    "This is done in order not to be responsible for the idea that I\nunderstand by it a gross sexual inclination towards the parents.",
    "The\ntrue facts of the case are much more complicated, as my investigations\npoint out.",
    "Originally incest probably never possessed particularly great\nsignificance as such, because cohabitation with an old woman for all\npossible motives could hardly be preferred to mating with a young woman.\n",
    "It seems that the mother has acquired incestuous significance only\npsychologically.",
    "Thus, for example, the incestuous unions of antiquity\nwere not a result of a love inclination, but of a special superstition,\nwhich is most intimately bound up with the mythical ideas here treated.\n",
    "A Pharaoh of the second dynasty is said to have married his sister, his\ndaughter and his granddaughter; the Ptolemies were accustomed also to\nmarriage with sisters; Kambyses married his sister; Artaxerxes married\nhis two daughters; Qobad I (sixth century A. D.) married his daughter.\n",
    "The Satrap Sysimithres married his mother.",
    "These incestuous unions are\nexplained by the circumstance that in the Zend Avesta the marriage of\nrelatives was directly commanded;[813] it emphasized the resemblance of\nrulers to the divinity, and, therefore, was more of an artificial than a\nnatural arrangement, because it originated more from a theoretical than\nfrom a biological inclination.",
    "(A practical impetus towards that lay\noften in the peculiar laws of inheritance left over from the _Mutter\nrecht_, “maternal right”",
    "[matriarchal], period.)",
    "The confusion which\ncertainly frequently involved the barbarians of antiquity in regard to\nthe choice of their sexual objects cannot very well be measured by the\nstandard of present-day love psychology.",
    "In any case, the incest of the\nsemi-animal past is in no way proportionate to the enormous significance\nof the incest phantasy among civilized people.",
    "This disproportion\nenforces the assumption that the incest prohibition which we meet even\namongst relatively lower races concerns rather the mythical ideas than\nthe biological damage; therefore, the ethnical prohibition almost always\nconcerns the mother and seldom the father.",
    "Incest prohibition can be\nunderstood, therefore, as a result of regression, and as the result of a\nlibidinous anxiety, which regressively attacks the mother.",
    "Naturally, it\nis difficult or impossible to say from whence this anxiety may have\ncome.",
    "I merely venture to suggest that it may have been a question of a\nprimitive separation of the pairs of opposites which are hidden in the\nwill of life: the will for life and for death.",
    "It remains obscure what\nadaptation the primitive man tried to evade through introversion and\nregression to the parents; but, according to the analogy of the soul\nlife in general, it may be assumed that the libido, which disturbed the\ninitial equilibrium of becoming and of ceasing to be, had been stored up\nin the attempt to make an especially difficult adaptation, and from\nwhich it recedes even to-day.",
    "After this long digression, let us turn back to the song of the Rigveda.\n",
    "Thinking and a conception of the world arose from a shrinking back from\nstern reality, and it is only after man has regressively assured himself\nagain of the protective parental power[814] that he enters life wrapped\nin a dream of childhood shrouded in magic superstitions; that is to say,\n“thinking,”[815] for he, timidly sacrificing his best and assuring\nhimself of the favor of the invisible powers, step by step develops to\ngreater power, in the degree that he frees himself from his\nretrogressive longing and the original lack of harmony in his being.",
    "Rigveda 10, 90, concludes with the exceedingly significant verse, which\nis of greatest importance for the Christian mysteries as well:",
    "“Gods, sacrificing, rendered homage to the sacrifice: these were the\n    earliest holy ordinances,\n The mighty ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sâdhyas,\n    goddesses of old, are dwelling.”",
    "Through the sacrifice a fulness of power was attained, which extends up\nto the power of the “parents.”",
    "Thus the sacrifice has also the meaning\nof a psychologic maturation process.",
    "In the same manner that the world originated through sacrifice, through\nthe renunciation of the retrospective mother libido, thus, according to\nthe teachings of the Upanishads, is produced the new condition of man,\nwhich may be termed the immortal.",
    "This new condition is again attained\nthrough a sacrifice; namely, through the sacrificial horse which is\ngiven a cosmic significance in the teaching of the Upanishads.",
    "What the\nsacrificial horse means is told by Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 1: 1:",
    "“_Om!_",
    "“1. The dawn is truly the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun his\n  eye, the wind his breath, his mouth the all-spreading fire, the year\n  is the body of the sacrificial horse.",
    "The sky is his back, the\n  atmosphere his body cavity, the earth the vault of his belly, the\n  poles are his sides, the space between the poles his ribs, the seasons\n  his limbs, the months and half-months his joints, day and night his\n  feet, the stars his bones, the clouds his flesh, the food, which he\n  digests, are the deserts; the rivers, his veins; liver and lungs, the\n  mountains; the herbs and trees, his hair; the rising sun is his\n  forepart, the setting sun his hind-part.",
    "When he shows his teeth, that\n  is lightning; when he trembles, that is thunder; when he urinates,\n  that is rain; his voice is speech.",
    "“2. The day, in truth, has originated for the horse as the sacrificial\n  dish, which stands before him; his cradle is in the world-sea towards\n  the East; the night has originated for him as the sacrificial dish,\n  which stands behind him; its cradle is in the world-sea of the\n  evening; these two dishes originated in order to surround the horse.\n  ",
    "As a charger he generated the gods, as champion he produced the\n  Gandharvas, as a racer the demons, as horse mankind.",
    "The Ocean is his\n  relative, the ocean his cradle.”",
    "As Deussen remarks, the sacrificial horse has the significance of a\n_renunciation of the universe_.",
    "When the horse is sacrificed, then the\nworld is sacrificed and destroyed, as it were—a train of thought which\nSchopenhauer also had in mind, and which appears as a product of a\ndiseased mind in Schreber.[816]",
    "The horse in the above text stands\nbetween two sacrificial vessels, from one of which it comes and to the\nother of which it goes, just as the sun passes from morning to evening.\n",
    "The horse, therefore, signifies the libido, which has passed into the\nworld.",
    "We previously saw that the “mother libido” must be sacrificed in\norder to produce the world; here the world is destroyed by the repeated\nsacrifice of the same libido, which once belonged to the mother.",
    "The\nhorse can, therefore, be substituted as a symbol for this libido,\nbecause, as we saw, it had manifold connections with the mother.[817]\nThe sacrifice of the horse can only produce another state of\nintroversion, which is similar to that before the creation of the world.\n",
    "The position of the horse between the two vessels, which represent the\nproducing and the devouring mother, hint at the idea of life enclosed in\nthe ovum; therefore, the vessels are destined to “surround” the horse.\n",
    "That this is actually so the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 3: 3 proves:",
    "“1. From where have the descendants of Parikshit come, that I ask\n  thee, Yâjñavalkya!",
    "From where came the descendants of Parikshit?",
    "“2. Yâjñavalkya spake: ‘He has told thee, they have come from where\n  all come, who offer up the sacrificial horse.",

    "These were brought by Indra as a falcon to the\n  wind: and the wind took them up into itself and carried them where\n  were the offerers of the sacrificial horse.",
    "Somewhat like this he\n  spoke (Gandharva to thee) and praised the wind.’",
    "“Therefore is the wind the special (vyashti) and the wind the\n  universal (samashti).",
    "He, who knows this, defends himself from dying\n  again.”",
    "As this text tells us, the offerers of the sacrificial horse come in\nthat _narrowest fissure_ between the shells of the egg of the world, at\nthat place, where the shells _unite and where they are divided_.",
    "The\nfissure (_vagina_) in the maternal world soul is designated by Plato in\n“Timaeus” by Χ, the symbol of the cross.",
    "Indra, who as a falcon has\nstolen the soma (the treasure attainable with difficulty), brings, as\nPsychopompos, the souls to the wind, to the generating pneuma, which\ncarries them forward to the fissure or vagina, to the point of union, to\nthe entrance into the maternal egg.",
    "This train of thought of the Hindoo\nphilosophy briefly and concisely summarizes the sense of innumerable\nmyths; at the same time it is a striking example of the fact that\nphilosophy is internally nothing else but a refined and sublimated\nmythology.",
    "It is brought to this refined state by the influence of the\ncorrector of reality.[818] We have emphasized the fact that in the\nMiller drama the horse is the first to die, as the animal brother of the\nhero.",

    "The\nsacrificial animal, where it has lost the primitive meaning of the\nsimple sacrificial gift, and has taken a higher religious significance,\nstands in a close relation to both the hero and the divinity.",
    "The animal\nrepresents the god himself;[819] thus the bull[820] represents Zagreus,\nDionysus and Mithra; the lamb represents Christ,[821] etc.",
    "As we are\naware, the animal symbols represent the animal libido.",
    "The sacrifice of\nthe animal means, therefore, the sacrifice of the animal nature.",

    "Attis is the\nson lover of the divine mother, Agdistis Cybele.",
    "Agdistis was\ncharacteristically androgynous,[822] as symbol of the mother-libido,\nlike the tree; really a clear indication that the mother-imago has in\naddition to the significance of the likeness of the real mother the\nmeaning of the mother of humanity, the libido in general.",
    "Driven mad by\nthe insanity-breeding mother enamored of him, he emasculates himself,\nand that under a pine tree.",

    "In this myth the phallic meaning of the tree (cutting down, castration)\nand its maternal significance (mounting and the sacrificial death of the\nson) is present; at the same time the supplementary counterpart to the\nPietà is apparent, the “terrible mother.”",

    "The\nanimal symbol is, so to speak, only a part of the hero; he sacrifices\nonly his animal; therefore, symbolically, renounces only his animal\nnature.",
    "The internal participation in the sacrifice[832] is expressed\nexcellently in the anguished ecstatic countenance of the bull-slaying\nMithra.",
    "He does it willingly and unwillingly[833] hence the somewhat\nhysterical expression which has some similarity to the well-known\nmawkish countenance of the Crucified of Guido Reni.",

    "The Ostian head of Mithra Tauroctonos, illustrated in Cumont, has,\nindeed, an expression which we recognize in our patients as one of\nsentimental resignation.",

    "Sentimentality is repressed brutality._",
    "Hence\nthe exceedingly sentimental pose, which had its counterpart in the\nsymbolism of the shepherd and the lamb of contemporaneous Christianity,\nwith the addition of infantilism.[837]",
    "Meanwhile, it is only his animal nature which the god sacrifices; that\nis to say, his sexuality,[838] always in close analogy to the course of\nthe sun.",
    "We have learned in the course of this investigation that the\npart of the libido which erects religious structures is in the last\nanalysis fixed in the mother, and really represents that tie through\nwhich we are permanently connected with our origin.",
    "Briefly, we may\ndesignate this amount of libido as “Mother Libido.”",
    "As we have seen,\nthis libido conceals itself in countless and very heterogeneous symbols,\nalso in animal images, no matter whether of masculine or feminine\nnature—differences of sex are at bottom of a secondary value and\npsychologically do not play the part which might be expected from a\nsuperficial observation.",
    "The annual sacrifice of the maiden to the dragon probably represented\nthe most ideal symbolic situation.",
    "In order to pacify the anger of the\n“terrible mother” the most beautiful woman was sacrificed as symbol of\nman’s libido.",
    "Less vivid examples are the sacrifice of the first-born\nand various valuable domestic animals.",
    "A second ideal case is the\nself-castration in the service of the mother (Dea Syria, etc.), a less\nobvious form of which is circumcision.",
    "By that at least only a portion\nis sacrificed.[839] With these sacrifices, the object of which in ideal\ncases is to symbolize the libido drawing away from the mother, life is\nsymbolically renounced in order to regain it.",
    "By the sacrifice man\nransoms himself from the fear of death and reconciles the destroying\nmother.",
    "In those later religions, where the hero, who in olden times\novercomes all evil and death through his labors, has become the divine\nchief figure, he becomes the priestly sacrificer and the regenerator of\nlife.",
    "But as the hero is an imaginary figure and his sacrifice is a\ntranscendental mystery, the significance of which far exceeds the value\nof an ordinary sacrificial gift, this deepening of the sacrificial\nsymbolism regressively resumes the idea of the human sacrifice.",
    "This is\npartly due to the preponderance of phantastic additions, which always\ntake their subject-matter from greater depths, and partly due to the\nhigher religious occupation of the libido, which demanded a more\ncomplete and equivalent expression.",
    "Thus the relation between Mithra and\nhis bull is very close.",
    "It is the hero himself in the Christian\nmysteries who sacrifices himself voluntarily.",
    "The hero, as we have\nsufficiently shown, is the infantile personality longing for the mother,\nwho as Mithra sacrifices the wish (the libido), and as Christ gives\nhimself to death both willingly and unwillingly.",
    "Upon the monuments of\nthe Mithraic religion we often meet a strange symbol: a crater (mixing\nbowl) encoiled by a serpent, sometimes with a lion, who as antagonist\nopposes the serpent.[840]",
    "It appears as if the two were fighting for the\ncrater.",
    "The crater symbolizes, as we have seen, the mother, the serpent\nthe resistance defending her, and the lion the greatest strength and\nstrongest will.[841]",
    "The struggle is for the mother.",
    "The serpent takes\npart almost regularly in the Mithraic sacrifice of the bull, moving\ntowards the blood flowing from the wound.",
    "It seems to follow from that\nthat the life of the bull (blood) is sacrificed to the serpent.\n",
    "Previously we have pointed out the mutual relationship between serpent\nand bull, and found there that the bull symbolizes the living hero, the\nshining sun, but that the serpent symbolizes the dead, buried or\nchthonic hero, the invisible sun.",
    "As the hero is in the mother in the\nstate of death, the serpent is also, as the symbol of the fear of death,\nthe sign of the devouring mother.",
    "The sacrifice of the bull to the\nserpent, therefore, signifies a willing renunciation of life, in order\nto win it from death.",
    "Therefore, after the sacrifice of the bull,\nwonderful fertility results.",
    "The antagonism between serpent and lion\nover the crater is to be interpreted as a battle over the fruitful\nmother’s womb, somewhat comparable to the more simple symbolism of the\nTishtriya song, where the demon Apaosha, the black horse, has possession\nof the rain lake, and the white horse, Tishtriya, must banish him from\nit.",
    "Death from time to time lays its destroying hand upon life and\nfertility and the libido disappears, by entering into the mother, from\nwhose womb it will be born renewed.",
    "It, therefore, seems very probable\nthat the significance of the Mithraic bull sacrifice is also that of the\nsacrifice of the mother who sends the fear of death.",
    "As the contrary of\nthe Occide moriturus is also intended here, so is the act of sacrifice\nan impregnating of the mother; the chthonic snake demon drinks the\nblood; that is to say, the libido (sperma) of the hero committing\nincest.",
    "Life is thus immortalized for the hero because, like the sun, he\ngenerates himself anew.",
    "After all the preceding materials, it can no\nlonger be difficult to recognize in the Christian mysteries the human\nsacrifice, or the sacrifice of the son to the mother.[842] Just as Attis\nemasculates himself on account of the mother, so does Christ himself\nhang upon the tree of life,[843] the wood of martyrdom, the ἑκάτη,[844]\nthe chthonic mother, and by that redeems creation from death.",
    "By\nentering again into the mother’s womb (Matuta, Pietà of Michelangelo) he\nredeems in death the sin in life of the primitive man, Adam, in order\nsymbolically through his deed[845] to procure for the innermost and most\nhidden meaning of the religious libido its highest satisfaction and most\npronounced expression.",
    "The martyrdom of Christ has in Augustine as well\nactually the meaning of a Hierosgamos with the mother (corresponding to\nthe Adonis festival, where Venus and Adonis were laid upon the nuptial\ncouch):",
    "“Procedit Christus quasi sponsus de thalamo suo, præsagio nuptiarum\n  exiit ad campum sæculi; pervenit usque ad crucis torum (torus has the\n  meaning of bed, pillow, concubine, bier) et ibi firmavit ascendendo\n  conjugium: ubi cum sentiret anhelantem in suspiriis creaturam\n  commercio pietatis se pro conjuge dedit ad pœnam et copulavit sibi\n  perpetuo iure matronam.”",
    "This passage is perfectly clear.",
    "A similar death overtakes the Syrian\nMelcarth, who, riding upon a sea horse, was annually burned.",
    "Among the\nGreeks he is called Melicertes, and was represented riding upon a\ndolphin.",
    "The dolphin is also the steed of Arion.",
    "We have learned to\nrecognize previously the maternal significance of dolphin, so that in\nthe death of Melcarth we can once more recognize the negatively\nexpressed Hierosgamos with the mother.",
    "(Compare Frazer “Golden Bough,”\nIV, p. 87.)",
    "This figurative expression is of the greatest teleological\nsignificance.",
    "Through its symbol it leads that libido which inclines\nbackward into the original, primitive and impulsive upwards to the\nspiritual by investing it with a mysterious but fruitful function.",
    "It is\nsuperfluous to speak of the effect of this symbol upon the unconscious\nof Occidental humanity.",
    "A glance over history shows what creative forces\nwere released in this symbol.[846]",
    "The comparison of the Mithraic and the Christian sacrifice plainly shows\nwherein lies the superiority of the Christian symbol; it is the frank\nadmission that not only are the lower wishes to be sacrificed, but the\nwhole personality.",
    "The Christian symbol demands complete devotion; it\ncompels a veritable self-sacrifice to a higher purpose, while the\nSacrificium Mithriacum, remaining fixed on a primitive symbolic stage,\nis contented with an animal sacrifice.",
    "The religious effect of these\nsymbols must be considered as an orientation of the unconscious by means\nof imitation.",
    "In Miss Miller’s phantasy there is internal compulsion, in that she\npasses from the horse sacrifice to the self-sacrifice of the hero.\n",
    "Whereas the first symbolizes renunciation of the sexual wishes, the\nsecond has the deeper and ethically more valuable meaning of the\nsacrifice of the infantile personality.",
    "The object of psychoanalysis has\nfrequently been wrongly understood to mean the renunciation or the\ngratification of the ordinary sexual wish, while, in reality, the\nproblem is the sublimation of the infantile personality, or, expressed\nmythologically, a sacrifice and rebirth of the infantile hero.[847]",
    "In\nthe Christian mysteries, however, the resurrected one becomes a\nsupermundane spirit, and the invisible kingdom of God, with its\nmysterious gifts, are obtained by his believers through the sacrifice of\nhimself on the mother.",
    "In psychoanalysis the infantile personality is\ndeprived of its libido fixations in a rational manner; the libido which\nis thus set free serves for the building up of a personality matured and\nadapted to reality, who does willingly and without complaint everything\nrequired by necessity.",
    "(It is, so to speak, the chief endeavor of the\ninfantile personality to struggle against all necessities and to create\ncoercions for itself where none exist in reality.)",
    "The serpent as an instrument of sacrifice has already been abundantly\nillustrated.",
    "(Legend of St. Silvester, trial of the virgins, wounding of\nRê and Philoctetes, symbolism of the lance and arrow.)",
    "It is the\ndestroying knife; but, according to the principle of the “Occide\nmoriturus” also the phallus, the sacrificial act represents a coitus act\nas well.[848]",
    "The religious significance of the serpent as a\ncave-dwelling, chthonic animal points to a further thought; namely, to\nthe creeping into the mother’s womb in the form of a serpent.[849] As\nthe horse is the brother, so the serpent is the sister of Chiwantopel.\n",
    "This close relation refers to a fellowship of these animals and their\ncharacters with the hero.",
    "We know of the horse that, as a rule, he is\nnot an animal of fear, although, mythologically, he has at times this\nmeaning.",
    "He signifies much more the living, positive part of the libido,\nthe striving towards continual renewal, whereas the serpent, as a rule,\nrepresents the fear, the fear of death,[850] and is thought of as the\nantithesis to the phallus.",
    "This antithesis between horse and serpent,\nmythologically between bull and serpent, represents an opposition of the\nlibido within itself, a striving forwards and a striving backwards at\none and the same time.[851]",
    "It is not only as if the libido might be an\nirresistible striving forward, an endless life and will for\nconstruction, such as Schopenhauer has formulated in his world will,\ndeath and every end being some malignancy or fatality coming from\nwithout, but the libido, corresponding to the sun, also wills the\ndestruction of its creation.",
    "In the first half of life its will is for\ngrowth, in the second half of life it hints, softly at first, and then\naudibly, at its will for death.",
    "And just as in youth the impulse to\nunlimited growth often lies under the enveloping covering of a\nresistance against life, so also does the will of the old to die\nfrequently lie under the covering of a stubborn resistance against the\nend.",
    "[Illustration: PRIAPUS AND SERPENT]",
    "This apparent contrast in the nature of the libido is strikingly\nillustrated by a Priapic statuette in the antique collection at\nVerona.[852] Priapus smilingly points with his finger to a snake biting\noff his “membrum.”",
    "He carries a basket on his arm, filled with oblong\nobjects, probably phalli, evidently prepared as substitutes.",
    "A similar motive is found in the “Deluge” of Rubens (in the Munich Art\nGallery), where a serpent emasculates a man.",
    "This motive explains the\nmeaning of the “Deluge”; the maternal sea is also the devouring\nmother.[853] The phantasy of the world conflagration, of the cataclysmic\nend of the world in general, is nothing but a mythological projection of\na personal individual will for death; therefore, Rubens could represent\nthe essence of the “Deluge” phantasy in the emasculation by the serpent;\nfor the serpent is our own repressed will for the end, for which we find\nan explanation only with the greatest difficulty.",
    "Concerning the symbolism of the serpent in general, its significance is\nvery dependent upon the time of life and circumstances.",
    "The repressed\nsexuality of youth is symbolized by the serpent, because the arrival of\nsexuality puts an end to childhood.",
    "To age, on the contrary, the serpent\nsignifies the repressed thought of death.",
    "With our author it is the\ninsufficiently expressed sexuality which as serpent assumes the rôle of\nsacrificer and delivers the hero over to death and rebirth.",
    "As in the beginning of our investigation the hero’s name forced us to\nspeak of the symbolism of Popocatepetl as belonging to the creating part\nof the human body, so at the end does the Miller drama again give us an\nopportunity of seeing how the volcano assists in the death of the hero\nand causes him to disappear by means of an earthquake into the depths of\nthe earth.",
    "As the volcano gave birth and name to the hero, so at the end\nof the day it devours him again.[854] We learn from the last words of\nthe hero that _his longed-for beloved_, she who alone understands him,\nis called Ja-ni-wa-ma.",
    "We find in this name those lisped syllables\nfamiliar to us from the early childhood of the hero, Hiawatha, Wawa,\nwama, mama.",
    "The only one who really understands us is the mother.",
    "For\n_verstehen_, “to understand” (Old High German _firstân_), is probably\nderived from a primitive Germanic prefix _fri_, identical with περὶ,\nmeaning “roundabout.”",
    "The Old High German _antfristôn_, “to interpret,”\nis considered as identical with _firstân_.",
    "From that results a\nfundamental significance of the verb _verstehen_, “to understand,” as\n“standing round about something.",
    "”[855] _Comprehendere_ and\nκατασυλλαμβάνειν express a similar idea as the German _erfassen_, “to\ngrasp, to comprehend.”",
    "The thing common to these expressions is the\nsurrounding, the enfolding.",
    "And there is no doubt that there is nothing\nin the world which so completely enfolds us as the mother.",
    "When the\nneurotic complains that the world has no understanding, he says\nindirectly that he misses the mother.",
    "Paul Verlaine has expressed this\nthought most beautifully in his poem, “Mon Rêve Familier”:",
    "_My Familiar Dream._",
    "“Often I have that strange and poignant dream\n           Of some unknown who meets my flame with flame—\n           Who, with each time, is never quite the same,\n         Yet never wholly different does she seem.\n         ",
    "She understands me!",
    "Every fitful gleam\n           Troubling my heart, she reads aright somehow:\n           Even the sweat upon my pallid brow\n         ",
    "She soothes with tears, a cool and freshening stream.",
    "“If she is dark or fair?",
    "I do not know—\n         Her name?",
    "Only that it is sweet and low,\n           Like those of loved ones who have long since died.\n         ",
    "Her look is like a statue’s, kind and clear;\n           And her calm voice, distant and dignified,\n         Like those hushed voices that I loved to hear.”"
