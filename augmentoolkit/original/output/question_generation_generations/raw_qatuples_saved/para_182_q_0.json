Thou wert my gladness,          My care wert thou!          Thy life I sheltered;          Or ere it was thine,          Or ere thou wert born,          My shield was thy guard.\u201d[786]The pre-existence of the hero and the pre-existence of Brunhilde as his wife-mother are clearly indicated from this passage.Siegfried says in confirmation:\u201cThen death took not my mother?           Bound in sleep did she lie?\u201dThe mother-imago, which is the symbol of the dying and resurrected libido, is explained by Brunhilde to the hero, as his own will:\u201cThyself am I            If blest I be in thy love.\u201dThe great mystery of the Logos entering into the mother for rebirth is proclaimed with the following words by Brunhilde:\u201cO Siegfried, Siegfried,          Conquering light!          I loved thee ever,          For I divined          The thought that Wotan had hidden\u2014          The thought that I dared          Not to whisper\u2014[787]          That all unclearly          Glowed in my bosom          Suffered and strove;          For which I flouted          Him, who conceived it:[787]          For which in penance          Prisoned I lay,          While thinking it not          And feeling only,          For, in my thought,          Oh, should you guess it?          Was only my love for thee.\u201dThe erotic similes which now follow distinctly reveal the motive of rebirth:",

    "question": "What does Brunhilde's confession about her relationship with Siegfried indicate about their pre-existence?",
    "answer": "Brunhilde's confession suggests that Siegfried and Brunhilde had a pre-existence, with Brunhilde being his wife-mother. This is evident from her statement, \"O knewest thou\u2014joy of the world, / How I have ever loved thee! / Thou wert my gladness, / My care wert thou! / Thy life I sheltered; / Or ere it was thine, / Or ere thou wert born, / My shield was thy guard.\" This indicates a deep, pre-established bond between them.",
