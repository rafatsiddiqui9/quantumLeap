The Priestess of Demeter seems to be\nthe representative of the earth goddess, perhaps the furrow of the\nfield.[666] The descent into the earth is also the symbol of the\nmother’s womb, and was a widespread conception under the form of cave\nworship. Plutarch relates of the Magi that they sacrificed to Ahriman,\nεἰς τόπον ἀνήλιον.[667] Lukian lets the magician Mithrobarzanes εἰς\nχωρίον ἔρημον καὶ ὑλῶδες καὶ ἀνήλιον,[668] descend into the bowels of\nthe earth. According to the testimony of Moses of the Koran, the sister\nFire and the brother Spring were worshipped in Armenia in a cave. Julian\ngave an account from the Attis legend of a κατάβασις εἰς ἄντρον,[669]\nfrom whence Cybele brings up her son lover, that is to say, gives birth\nto him.[670] The cave of Christ’s birth, in Bethlehem (‘House of\nBread’), is said to have been an Attis spelæum.\n\nA further Eleusinian symbolism is found in the festival of Hierosgamos,\nin the form of the _mystic chests_, which, according to the testimony of\nClemens of Alexandria, may have contained pastry, salt and fruits. The\nsynthema (confession) of the mystic transmitted by Clemens is suggestive\nin still other directions:\n\n  “I have fasted, I have drunk of the barleydrink, I have taken from the\n  chest and after I have labored, I have placed it back in the basket,\n  and from the basket into the chest.”\n\nThe question as to what lay in the chest is explained in detail by\nDieterich.[671] The labor he considers a phallic activity, which the\nmystic has to perform. In fact, representations of the mystic basket are\ngiven, wherein lies a phallus surrounded by fruits.[672] Upon the\nso-called Lovatelli tomb vase, the sculptures of which are understood to\nbe Eleusinian ceremonies, it is shown how a mystic caressed the serpent\nentwining Demeter. The caressing of the fear animal indicates a\nreligious conquering of incest.[673] According to the testimony of\nClemens of Alexandria, a serpent was in the chest. The serpent in this\nconnection is naturally of phallic nature, the phallus which is\nforbidden in relation to the mother. Rohde mentions that in the\nArrhetophories, pastry, in the form of phalli and serpents, were thrown\ninto the cave near the Thesmophorion. This custom was a petition for the\nbestowal of children and harvest.[674] The snake also plays a large part\nin initiations under the remarkable title ὁ διὰ κόλπου θεός.[675]\nClemens observes that the symbol of the Sabazios mysteries is ὁ διὰ\nκόλπων θεός, δράκων δὲ ἐστι καὶ οὗτος διελκόμενος τοῦ κόλπου τῶν\nτελουμένων.[676]\n\nThrough Arnobius we learn:\n\n  “Aureus coluber in sinum demittitur consecratis et eximitur rursus ab\n  inferioribus partibus atque imis.”[677]\n\nIn the Orphic Hymn 52, Bacchus is invoked by ὑποκόλπιε,[678] which\nindicates that the god enters into man as if through the female\ngenitals.[679] According to the testimony of Hippolytus, the hierophant\nin the mystery exclaimed ἱερον ἔτεκε πότνια κοῦρον, Βριμὼ βριμόν (the\nrevered one has brought forth a holy boy, Brimos from Brimo). This\nChristmas gospel, “Unto us a son is born,” is illustrated especially\nthrough the tradition[680] that the Athenians “secretly show to the\npartakers in the Epoptia, the great and wonderful and most perfect\nEpoptic mystery, _a mown stalk of wheat_.”[681]\n\nThe parallel for the motive of death and resurrection is the motive of\nlosing and finding. The motive appears in religious rites in exactly the\nsame connection, namely, in spring festivities similar to the\nHierosgamos, where the image of the god was hidden and found again. It\nis an uncanonical tradition that Moses left his father’s house when\ntwelve years old to teach mankind. In a similar manner Christ is lost by\nhis parents, and they find him again as a teacher of wisdom, just as in\nthe Mohammedan legend Moses and Joshua lose the fish, and in his place\nChidher, the teacher of wisdom, appears (like the boy Jesus in the\ntemple); so does the corn god, lost and believed to be dead, suddenly\narise again from his mother into renewed youth. (That Christ was laid in\nthe manger is suggestive of fodder. Robertson, therefore, places the\nmanger as parallel to the liknon.)\n\nWe understand from these accounts why the Eleusinian mysteries were for\nthe mystic so rich in comfort for the hope of a better world. A\nbeautiful Eleusinian epitaph shows this:\n\n     “Truly, a beautiful secret is proclaimed by the blessed Gods!\n     Mortality is not a curse, but death a blessing!”\n\nThe hymn to Demeter[682] in the mysteries also says the same:\n\n       “Blessed is he, the earth-born man, who hath seen this!\n       Who hath not shared in these divine ceremonies,\n       He hath an unequal fate in the obscure darkness of death.”\n\nImmortality is inherent in the Eleusinian symbol; in a church song of\nthe nineteenth century by Samuel Preiswerk we discover it again:\n\n                 “The world is yours, Lord Jesus,\n                 The world, on which we stand,\n                 Because it is thy world\n                 It cannot perish.\n                 Only the wheat, before it comes\n                 Up to the light in its fertility,\n                 Must die in the bosom of the earth\n                 First freed from its own nature.\n\n                 “Thou goest, O Lord, our chief,\n                 To heaven through thy sorrows,\n                 And guide him who believes\n                 In thee on the same path.\n                 Then take us all equally\n                 To share in thy sorrows and kingdoms,\n                 Guide us through thy gate of death,\n                 Bring thy world into the light.”\n\nFirmicus relates concerning the Attis mysteries:\n\n  “Nocte quadam simulacrum in lectica supinum ponitur et per numeros\n  digestis fletibus plangitur; deinde cum se ficta lamentatione\n  satiaverint, lumen infertur: tunc a sacerdote omnium qui flebant\n  fauces unguentur, quibus perunctis sacerdos hoc lento murmure\n  susurrat: ‘Θαρρεῖτε μύσται τοῦ Θεοῦ σεσωσμένου ἔσται γὰρ ἡμῖν ἐκ πόνου\n  σωτηρία.’”[683]\n\nSuch parallels show how little human personality and how much divine,\nthat is to say, universally human, is found in the Christ mystery. No\nman is or, indeed, ever was, a hero, for the hero is a god, and,\ntherefore, impersonal and generally applicable to all. Christ is a\n“spirit,” as is shown in the very early Christian interpretation. In\ndifferent places of the earth, and in the most varied forms and in the\ncoloring of various periods, the Savior-hero appears as a fruit of the\nentrance of the libido into the personal maternal depths. The Bacchian\nconsecrations represented upon the Farnese relief contain a scene where\na mystic wrapped in a mantle, drawn over his head, was led to Silen, who\nholds the “λῖχνον” (chalice), covered with a cloth. The covering of the\nhead signifies death. The mystic dies, figuratively, like the seed corn,\ngrows again and comes to the corn harvest. Proclus relates that the\nmystics were buried up to their necks. The Christian church as a place\nof religious ceremony is really nothing but the grave of a hero\n(catacombs). The believer descends into the grave, in order to rise from\nthe dead with the hero. That the meaning underlying the church is that\nof the mother’s womb can scarcely be doubted. The symbols of Mass are so\ndistinct that the mythology of the sacred act peeps out everywhere. It\nis the magic charm of rebirth. The veneration of the Holy Sepulchre is\nmost plain in this respect. A striking example is the Holy Sepulchre of\nSt. Stefano in Bologna. The church itself, a very old polygonal\nbuilding, consists of the remains of a temple to Isis. The interior\ncontains an artificial spelæum, a so-called Holy Sepulchre, into which\none creeps through a very little door. After a long sojourn, the\nbeliever reappears reborn from this mother’s womb. An Etruscan ossuarium\nin the archeological museum in Florence is at the same time a statue of\nMatuta, the goddess of death; the clay figure of the goddess is hollowed\nwithin as a receptacle for the ashes. The representations indicate that\nMatuta is the mother. Her chair is adorned with sphinxes, as a fitting\nsymbol for the mother of death.\n\n[Illustration: THE SO-CALLED HOLY SEPULCHRE OF S. STEFANO AT BOLOGNA]\n\nOnly a few of the further deeds of Hiawatha can interest us here. Among\nthese is the battle with Mishe-Nahma, the fish-king, in the eighth song.\nThis deserves to be mentioned as a typical battle of the sun-hero.\nMishe-Nahma is a fish monster, who dwells at the bottom of the waters.\nChallenged by Hiawatha to battle, he devours the hero, together with his\nboat:\n\n                 “In his wrath he darted upward,\n                 Flashing leaped into the sunshine,\n                 Opened his great jaws, and swallowed\n                 Both canoe and Hiawatha.\n\n                 “Down into that darksome cavern\n                 Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,\n                 As a log on some black river\n                 Shoots and plunges down the rapids,\n                 Found himself in utter darkness,\n                 Groped about in helpless wonder,\n                 Till he felt a great heart beating,\n                 Throbbing in that utter darkness.\n                 And he smote it in his anger,\n                 With his fist, the heart of Nahma,\n                 Felt the mighty king of fishes\n                 Shudder through each nerve and fibre.\n\n                        ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\n\n                 Crosswise then did Hiawatha\n                 Drag his birch-canoe for safety,\n                 Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,\n                 In the turmoil and confusion,\n                 Forth he might be hurled, and perish.”",
