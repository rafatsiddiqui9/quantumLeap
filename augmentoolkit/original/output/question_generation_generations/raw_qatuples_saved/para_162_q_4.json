    "paragraph": "in the form of scarcely concealed fits of masturbation, which were associated with this very act of boring. As already observed, the primary boring appeared at a time which preceded the infantile onanism localized in the genitals. This fact is of significance in so far as this boring differs thereby from a similar later practice which appeared after the genital onanism. The later bad habits represent, as a rule, a substitution for repressed genital masturbation, or for an attempt in this direction.

This persistence suggests that the individual continues to seek fulfillment through these substitute behaviors, which are attempts to address repressed desires related to genital masturbation.",
