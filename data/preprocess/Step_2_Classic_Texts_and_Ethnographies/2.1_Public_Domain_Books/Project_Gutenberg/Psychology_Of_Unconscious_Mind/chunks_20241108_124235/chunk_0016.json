To this inner demand belongs the\ncandid avowal of sin and the Christian humility presuming such an\navowal. Both are for the purpose of making it possible for one to\nexamine one’s self and to know one’s self.[84] One may consider the\nmutual avowal of sins as the most powerful support to this work of\neducation (“Confess, therefore, your sins one to another.”—James v: 16).\nThese measures aim at a conscious recognition of the conflicts,\nthoroughly psychoanalytic, which is also _a conditio sine qua non_ of\nthe psychoanalytic condition of recovery. Just as psychoanalysis in the\nhands of the physician, a secular method, sets up the real object of\ntransference as the one to take over the conflicts of the oppressed and\nto solve them, so the Christian religion sets up the Saviour, considered\nas real; “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness\nof sins....” (Eph. i: 7 and Col. i: 14.)[85] He is the deliverer and\nredeemer of our guilt, a God who stands above sin, “who did no sin,\nneither was guile found in his mouth” (Pet. ii: 22). “Who his own self\nbare our sins in his body upon the tree” (Pet. ii: 24). “Therefore\nChrist has been sacrificed once to take away the sins of many” (Heb. ix:\n28). The God, thus thought of, is distinguished as innocent in himself\nand as the self-sacrificer. (These qualities are true also for that\namount of energy—libido—which belongs to the representation complex\ndesignated the Redeemer.) The conscious projection towards which the\nChristian education aims, offers, therefore, a double benefit: first,\none is kept conscious of the conflict (sins) of two opposing tendencies\nmutually resistant, and through this one prevents a known trouble from\nbecoming, by means of repressing and forgetting, an unknown and\ntherefore so much more tormenting sorrow. Secondly, one lightens one’s\nburden by surrendering it to him to whom all solutions are known. One\nmust not forget that the individual psychologic roots of the Deity, set\nup as real by the pious, are concealed from him, and that he, although\nunaware of this, still bears the burden alone and is still alone with\nhis conflict. This delusion would lead infallibly to the speedy breaking\nup of the system, for Nature cannot indefinitely be deceived, but the\npowerful institution of Christianity meets this situation. The command\nin the book of James is the best expression of the psychologic\nsignificance of this: “Bear ye one another’s burdens.”[86]\n\nThis is emphasized as especially important in order to preserve society\nupright through mutual love (Transference); the Pauline writings leave\nno doubt about this:\n\n  “Through love be servants one to another.”—_Gal._ v: 13.\n\n  “Let love of the brethren continue.”—_Heb._ xiii: 1.\n\n  “And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works.\n  Not forgetting our own assembling together as is the custom of some,\n  but exhorting one another.”—_Heb._ x: 24–25.\n\nWe might say that the real transference taught in the Christian\ncommunity is the condition absolutely necessary for the efficacy of the\nmiracle of redemption; the first letter of John comes out frankly with\nthis:\n\n  “He that loveth his brother abideth in the light.”—_I John_ ii: 10.\n\n  “If we love one another, God abideth in us.”—_I John_ iv: 12.\n\nThe Deity continues to be efficacious in the Christian religion only\nupon the foundation of brotherly love. Consequently, here too the\nmystery of redemption is the unresisting real transference.[87] One may\nproperly ask one’s self, for what then is the Deity useful, if his\nefficacy consists only in the _real transference_? To this also the\nevangelical message has a striking answer:\n\n  “Men are all brothers in Christ.”\n\n  “So Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many,\n  shall appear a second time apart from sin to them that wait for him\n  unto salvation.”—_Heb._ ix: 28.\n\nThe condition of transference among brothers is to be such as between\nman and Christ, a spiritual one. As the history of ancient cults and\ncertain Christian sects shows, this explanation of the Christian\nreligion is an especially important one biologically, for the\npsychologic intimacy creates certain shortened ways between men which\nlead only too easily to that from which Christianity seeks to release\nthem, namely to the sexual relation with all those consequences and\nnecessities under which the really already highly civilized man had to\nsuffer at the beginning of our Christian era. For just as the ancient\nreligious experience was regarded distinctly as a bodily union with the\nDeity,[88] just so was worship permeated with sexuality of every kind.\nSexuality lay only too close to the relations of people with each other.\nThe moral degeneracy of the first Christian century produced a moral\nreaction arising out of the darkness of the lowest strata of society\nwhich was expressed in the second and third centuries at its purest in\nthe two antagonistic religions, Christianity on the one side, and\nMithracism on the other. These religions strove after precisely that\nhigher form of social intercourse symbolic of a projected “become flesh”\nidea (logos), whereby all those strongest impulsive energies of the\narchaic man, formerly plunging him from one passion into another,[89]\nand which seemed to the ancients like the compulsion of the evil\nconstellations, as εἱμαρμένη,[90] and which in the sense of later ages\nmight be translated as the driving force of the libido,[91] the δύναμις\nκινητική[92] of Zeno, could be made use of for social preservation.[93]\n\nIt may be assumed most certainly that the domestication of humanity has\ncost the greatest sacrifices. An age which produced the stoical ideal\nmust certainly have known why and against what it was created. The age\nof Nero serves to set off effectually the famous extracts from the\nforty-first letter of Seneca to Lucilius:\n\n  “One drags the other into error, and how can we attain to salvation\n  when no one bids us halt, when all the world drives us in deeper?”\n\n  “Do you ever come across a man unafraid in danger, untouched by\n  desires, happy in misfortune, peaceful in the midst of a storm,\n  elevated above ordinary mortals, on the same plane as the gods, does\n  not reverence seize you? Are you not compelled to say, ‘Such an\n  exalted being is certainly something different from the miserable body\n  which he inhabits?’ A divine strength rules there, such an excellent\n  mind, full of moderation, raised above all trivialities, which smiles\n  at that which we others fear or strive after: a heavenly power\n  animates such a person, a thing of this kind does not exist without\n  the coöperation of a deity. The largest part of such a being belongs\n  to the region from which he came. Just as the sun’s rays touch the\n  earth in reality and yet are at home only there from whence they come,\n  so an eminent holy man associates with us. He is sent to us that we\n  may learn to know the divine better, and although with us, still\n  really belongs to his original home. He looks thither and reaches\n  towards it; among us he walks as an exalted being.”\n\nThe people of this age had grown ripe for identification with the λόγος\n(word) “become flesh,” for the founding of a new fellowship, united by\none idea,[94] in the name of which people could love each other and call\neach other brothers.[95] The old vague idea of a μεσίτης (Messiah), of a\nmediator in whose name new ways of love would be created, became a fact,\nand with that humanity made an immense step forward. This had not been\nbrought about by a speculative, completely sophisticated philosophy, but\nby an elementary need in the mass of people vegetating in spiritual\ndarkness. The profoundest necessities had evidently driven them towards\nthat, since humanity did not thrive in a state of dissoluteness.[96] The\nmeaning of those cults—I speak of Christianity and Mithracism—is clear;\nit is a moral restraint of animal impulses.[97] The dynamic appearance\nof both religions betrays something of that enormous feeling of\nredemption which animated the first disciples and which we to-day\nscarcely know how to appreciate, for these old truths are empty to us.\nMost certainly we should still understand it, had our customs even a\nbreath of ancient brutality, for we can hardly realize in this day the\nwhirlwinds of the unchained libido which roared through the ancient Rome\nof the Cæsars. The civilized man of the present day seems very far\nremoved from that. He has become merely neurotic. So for us the\nnecessities which brought forth Christianity have actually been lost,\nsince we no longer understand their meaning. We do not know against what\nit had to protect us.[98] For enlightened people, the so-called\nreligiousness has already approached very close to a neurosis. In the\npast two thousand years Christianity has done its work and has erected\nbarriers of repression, which protect us from the sight of our own\n“sinfulness.” The elementary emotions of the libido have come to be\nunknown to us, for they are carried on in the unconscious; therefore,\nthe belief which combats them has become hollow and empty. Let whoever\ndoes not believe that a mask covers our religion, obtain an impression\nfor himself from the appearance of our modern churches, from which style\nand art have long since fled.\n\nWith this we turn back to the question from which we digressed, namely,\nwhether or not Miss Miller has created something valuable with her poem.\nIf we bear in mind under what psychologic or moral conditions\nChristianity came into existence; that is to say, at a time when fierce\nbrutality was an every-day spectacle, then we understand the religious\nseizure of the whole personality and the worth of that religion which\ndefended the people of the Roman culture against the visible storms of\nwickedness. It was not difficult for those people to remain conscious of\nsin, for they saw it every day spread out before their eyes. The\nreligious product was at that time the accomplishment of the total\npersonality. Miss Miller not only undervalues her “sins,” but the\nconnection between the “depressing and unrelenting need” and her\nreligious product has even escaped her. Thus her poetical creation\ncompletely loses the living value of a religious product. It is not much\nmore than a sentimental transformation of the erotic which is secretly\ncarried out close to consciousness and principally possesses the same\nworth as the manifest content of the dream[99] with its uncertain and\ndelusive perishableness. Thus the poem is properly only a dream become\naudible.\n\nTo the degree that the modern consciousness is eagerly busied with\nthings of a wholly other sort than religion, religion and its object,\noriginal sin, have stepped into the background; that is to say, into the\nunconscious in great part. Therefore, to-day man believes neither in the\none nor in the other. Consequently the Freudian school is accused of an\nimpure phantasy, and yet one might convince one’s self very easily with\na rather fleeting glance at the history of ancient religions and morals\nas to what kind of demons are harbored in the human soul. With this\ndisbelief in the crudeness of human nature is bound up the disbelief in\nthe power of religion. The phenomenon, well known to every\npsychoanalyst, of the unconscious transformation of an erotic conflict\ninto religious activity is something _ethically wholly worthless_ and\nnothing but an hysterical production. Whoever, on the other hand, to his\nconscious sin just as consciously places religion in opposition, does\nsomething the greatness of which cannot be denied. This can be verified\nby a backward glance over history. Such a procedure is sound religion.\n_The unconscious recasting of the erotic into something religious lays\nitself open to the reproach of a sentimental and ethically worthless\npose._",
