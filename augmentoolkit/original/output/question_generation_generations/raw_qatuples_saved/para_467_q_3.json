    "paragraph": "\u201cDead he lay there in the forest,          By the ford across the river.\u201dThis is typical of Hiawatha\u2019s deeds. Whatever he kills, for the most part, lies _next to or in the water_, sometimes half in the water and half on the land.[647] It seems that this must well be so. The later adventures will teach us why this must be so. The buck was no ordinary animal, but a magic one; that is to say, one with an additional unconscious significance. Hiawatha made for himself gloves and moccasins from its hide; the gloves imparted such strength to his arms that he could crumble rocks to dust, and the moccasins had the virtue of the seven-league boots. By enwrapping himself in the buck\u2019s skin he really became a giant. This motive, together with the death of the animal at the ford,[648] in the water, reveals the fact that the parents are concerned, whose gigantic proportions as compared with the child are of great significance in the unconscious. The \u201ctoys of giants\u201d is a wish inversion of the infantile phantasy. The dream of an eleven-year-old girl expresses this:\u201cI am as high as a church steeple; then a policeman comes. I tell him,  \u2018If you say anything, I will cut off your head.\u2019\u201dThe \u201cpoliceman,\u201d as the analysis brought out, referred to the father, whose gigantic size was over-compensated by the church steeple. In Mexican human sacrifices, the gods were represented by criminals, who were slaughtered, and flayed, and the Corybantes then clothed themselves in the bloody skins, in order to illustrate the resurrection of the gods.[649] (The snake\u2019s casting of his skin as a symbol of rejuvenation.)",

    "question": "How does the location of the buck's death at the ford relate to the significance of its size?",
    "answer": "The buck's death at the ford, which is a water feature, underscores the magical and transformative significance of the animal. The large size of the buck compared to Hiawatha, who is a child, suggests that it represents a significant challenge and transformation for him.",
