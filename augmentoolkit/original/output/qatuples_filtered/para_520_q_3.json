    "paragraph": "Thus this mother does not only become the mother of all abominations, but also in truth the receptacle of all that is wicked and unclean. The birds are images of souls;[434] therefore, this means all souls of the condemned and evil spirits. Thus the mother becomes Hecate, the underworld, the City of the damned itself. We recognize easily in the ancient idea of the woman on the dragon,[435] the above-mentioned representation of Echnida, the mother of the infernal horrors. Babylon is the idea of the \u201cterrible\u201d mother, who seduces all people to whoredom with devilish temptation, and makes them drunk with her wine. The intoxicating drink stands in the closest relation to fornication, for it is also a libido symbol, as we have already seen in the parallel of fire and sun. After the fall and curse of Babylon, we find in Revelation (xix:6\u20137) the hymn which leads from the under half to the upper half of the mother, where now everything is possible which would be impossible without the repression of incest:(6) \u201cAlleluia, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.(7) \u201cLet us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the  marriage of the Lamb is come,[436] and his wife hath made herself  ready.(8) \u201cAnd to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,  clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.(9) \u201cAnd he saith unto me, \u2018Write, Blessed are they which are called  unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.\u2019\u201dThe Lamb is the son of man who celebrates his marriage with the \u201cwoman.\u201d Who the \u201cwoman\u201d is remains obscure at first. But Revelation (xxi:9) shows us which \u201cwoman\u201d is the bride, the Lamb\u2019s wife:(9) \u201cCome hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb\u2019s wife.[437](10) \u201cAnd he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high  mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,  descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.\u201d",

    "question": "What does the hymn in Revelation (xix:6\u20137) suggest about the marriage of the Lamb and his wife?\n\n**ANSISWER:**\nThe hymn in Revelation (xix:6\u20137) suggests that the marriage of the Lamb is a significant event, where the Lamb, who is the son of man, celebrates his marriage with his wife. The wife is described as having made herself ready and is arrayed in fine linen, which symbolizes the righteousness of the saints. The hymn also suggests that calling to the marriage supper of the Lamb is blessed, indicating the importance and sanctity of this union.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWho is the \"woman\" in the text, and what is her significance in relation to the Lamb?",
    "answer": "The identity of the \"woman\" in the text is initially obscure, but Revelation (xxi:9) clarifies that she is the bride, the Lamb's wife. The text describes how the Lamb leads the narrator to a great and high mountain, where he reveals the bride as the holy city, Jerusalem, descending from heaven. This suggests that the \"woman\" is a symbol of the purified and holy community that the Lamb (the son of man) is marrying.",
