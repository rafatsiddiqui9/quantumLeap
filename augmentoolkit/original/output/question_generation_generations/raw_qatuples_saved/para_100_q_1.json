    "paragraph": "A six-year-old girl, who goes to school unwillingly, dreams that her leg is encircled by a large red worm. She had a tender interest for this creature, contrary to what might be expected. An adult patient, who cannot separate from an older friend on account of an extraordinarily strong mother transference, dreams that \u201cshe had to get across some deep water (typical idea!) with this friend; her friend fell in (mother transference); she tries to drag her out, and almost succeeds, but a large crab seizes on the dreamer by the foot and tries to pull her in.\u201d",

    "question": "An adult patient dreams about crossing deep water with a friend, but the friend falls in, and the patient tries to rescue them. However, a large crab grabs the patient's foot. What might this dream suggest about the patient's relationship with their older friend?",
    "answer": "This dream might suggest that the patient has a strong emotional connection with their older friend, as indicated by the need to rescue them. The falling friend could represent the patient's feelings of vulnerability or the fear that their friend might leave them. The crab grabbing the patient's foot might symbolize an external force or anxiety that threatens the patient's emotional security and threatens to pull them into difficult situations.",
