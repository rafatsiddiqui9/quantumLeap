Hor-pi-chrud, as his real name[483] reads, is\ncomposed from _chrud_, “child,” and _Hor_, from the adjective _hri_ =\nup, on top, and signifies the up-coming child, as the rising sun, and\nopposed to Osiris, who personifies the setting sun—the sun of the west.\nThus Osiris and Horpichrud or Horus are one being, both husband and son\nof the same mother, Hathor-Isis. The Chnum-Ra, the sun god of lower\nEgypt, represented as a ram, has at his side, as the female divinity of\nthe land, Hatmehit, who wears the fish on her head. She is the mother\nand wife of Bi-neb-did (Ram, local name of Chnum-Ra). In the hymn of\nHibis,[484] Amon-ra was invoked:\n\n  “Thy (Chum-Ram) dwells in Mendes, united as the quadruple god Thmuis.\n  He is the phallus, the lord of the gods. The bull of his mother\n  rejoices in the cow (ahet, the mother) and man fructifies through his\n  semen.”\n\nIn further inscriptions Hatmehit was directly referred to as the “mother\nof Mendes.” (Mendes is the Greek form of Bi-neb-did: ram.) She is also\ninvoked as the “Good,” with the additional significance of _ta-nofert_,\nor “young woman.” The cow as symbol of the mother is found in all\npossible forms and variations of Hathor-Isis, and also in the female Nun\n(parallel to this is the primitive goddess Nit or Neith), the protoplasm\nwhich, related to the Hindoo Atman,[485] is equally of masculine and\nfeminine nature. Nun is, therefore, invoked as Amon,[486] the original\nwater,[487] which is in the beginning. He is also designated as the\nfather of fathers, the mother of mothers. To this corresponds the\ninvocation to the female side of Nun-Amon, of Nit or Neith.\n\n  “Nit, the ancient, the mother of god, the mistress of Esne, the father\n  of fathers, the mother of mothers, who is the beetle and the vulture,\n  the being in its beginning.\n\n  “Nit, the ancient, the mother who bore the light god, Râ, who bore\n  first of all, when there was nothing which brought forth.\n\n  “The cow, the ancient, which bore the sun, and then laid the germ of\n  gods and men.”\n\nThe word “nun” has the significance of young, fresh, new, also the\non-coming waters of the Nile flood. In a transferred sense “nun” was\nalso used for the chaotic primitive waters; in general for the primitive\ngenerating matter[488] which was personified by the goddess Nunet. From\nher Nut sprang, the goddess of heaven, who was represented with a starry\nbody, and also as the heavenly cow with a starry body.\n\nWhen the sun-god, little by little, retires on the back of the heavenly\ncow, just as poor Lazarus returns into Abraham’s bosom, each has the\nsame significance; they return into the mother, in order to rise as\nHorus. Thus it can be said that in the morning the goddess is the\nmother, at noon the sister-wife and in the evening again the mother, who\nreceives the dying in her lap, reminding us of the Pietà of\nMichelangelo. As shown by the illustration (from Dideron’s “Iconographie\nChrétienne”), this thought has been transferred as a whole into\nChristianity.\n\nThus the fate of Osiris is explained: he passes into the mother’s womb,\nthe chest, the sea, the tree, the column of Astartes; he is dismembered,\nre-formed, and reappears again in his son, Hor-pi-chrud.\n\nBefore entering upon the further mysteries which the beautiful myth\nreveals to us, there is still much to be said about the symbol of the\ntree. Osiris lies in the branches of the tree, surrounded by them, as in\nthe mother’s womb. The motive of _embracing and entwining_ is often\nfound in the sun myths, meaning that it is the _myth of rebirth_. A good\nexample is the Sleeping Beauty, also the legend of the girl who is\nenclosed between the bark and the trunk, but who is freed by a youth\nwith his horn.[489] The horn is of gold and silver, which hints at the\nsunbeam in the phallic meaning. (Compare the previous legend of the\nhorn.) An exotic legend tells of the sun-hero, how he must be freed from\nthe plant entwining around him.[490] A girl dreams of her lover who has\nfallen into the water; she tries to save him, but first has to pull\nseaweed and sea-grass from the water; then she catches him. In an\nAfrican myth the hero, after his act, must first be disentangled from\nthe seaweed. In a Polynesian myth the hero’s ship was encoiled by the\ntentacles of a gigantic polyp. Rê’s ship is encoiled by a night serpent\non its night journey on the sea. In the poetic rendering of the history\nof Buddha’s birth by Sir Edwin Arnold (“The Light of Asia,” p. 5) the\nmotive of an embrace is also found:\n\n         “Queen Maya stood at noon, her days fulfilled,\n         Under a Palso in the palace grounds,\n         A stately trunk, straight as a temple shaft,\n         With crown of glossy leaves and fragrant blooms;\n         And knowing the time come—for all things knew—\n         The conscious tree bent down its boughs to make\n         A bower about Queen Maya’s majesty:\n         And earth put forth a thousand sudden flowers\n         To spread a couch: while ready for the bath\n         The rock hard by gave out a limpid stream\n         Of crystal flow. So brought she forth the child.”[491]\n\nWe come across a very similar motive in the cult legend of the Samian\nHera. Yearly it was claimed that the image disappeared from the temple,\nwas fastened somewhere on the seashore on a trunk of a Lygos tree and\nwound about with its branches. There it was “found,” and was treated\nwith wedding-cake. This feast is undoubtedly a ἱερὸς γάμος (ritual\nmarriage), because in Samos there was a legend that Zeus had first had a\nlong-continued secret love relation with Hera. In Plataea and Argos, the\nmarriage procession was represented with bridesmaids, marriage feast,\nand so on. The festival took place in the wedding month “Γαμηλιών”\n(beginning of February). But in Plataea the image was previously carried\ninto a lonely place in the wood; approximately corresponding to the\nlegend of Plutarch that Zeus had kidnapped Hera and then had hidden her\nin a cave of Cithaeron. According to our deductions, previously made, we\nmust conclude from this that there is still another train of thought,\nnamely, the magic charm of a rejuvenation, which is condensed in the\nHierosgamos. The disappearance and hiding in the wood, in the cave, on\nthe seashore, entwined in a willow tree, points to the death of the sun\nand rebirth. The early springtime Γαμηλιών (the time of Marriage) in\nFebruary fits in with that very well. In fact, Pausanias informs us that\nthe Argivian Hera _became a maiden again by a yearly bath in the spring\nof Canathos_. The significance of the bath is emphasized by the\ninformation that in the Plataeian cult of Hera Teleia, Tritonian nymphs\nappeared as water-carriers. In a tale from the Iliad, where the conjugal\ncouch of Zeus upon Mount Ida is described, it is said:[492]\n\n         “The son of Saturn spake, and took his wife\n         Into his arms, while underneath the pair,\n         The sacred Earth threw up her freshest herbs:\n         The dewy lotos, and the crocus-flower,\n         And thick and soft the hyacinth. All these\n         Upbore them from the ground. Upon this couch\n         They lay, while o’er them a bright golden cloud\n         Gathered and shed its drops of glistening dew.\n         So slumbered on the heights of Gargarus\n         The All-Father overcome by sleep and love,\n         And held his consort in his arms.”\n                                       —Trans. by W. C. Bryant.\n\nDrexler recognizes in this description an unmistakable allusion to the\ngarden of the gods on the extreme western shore of the ocean, an idea\nwhich might have been taken from a Prehomeric Hierosgamos hymn. This\nwestern land is the land of the setting sun, whither Hercules,\nGilgamesh, etc., hasten with the sun, in order to find there\nimmortality, where the sun and the maternal sea unite in an eternally\nrejuvenating intercourse. Our supposition of a condensation of the\nHierosgamos with the myth of rebirth is probably confirmed by this.\nPausanias mentions a related myth fragment where the statue of Artemis\nOrthia is also called Lygodesma (chained with willows), because it was\nfound in a willow tree; this tale seems to be related to the general\nGreek celebration of Hierosgamos with the above-mentioned customs.[493]\n\nThe motive of the “devouring” which Frobenius has shown to be a regular\nconstituent of the sun myths is closely related to this (also\nmetaphorically). The “whale dragon” (mother’s womb) always “devours” the\nhero. The devouring may also be partial instead of complete.\n\nA six-year-old girl, who goes to school unwillingly, dreams that her leg\nis encircled by a large red worm. She had a tender interest for this\ncreature, contrary to what might be expected. An adult patient, who\ncannot separate from an older friend on account of an extraordinarily\nstrong mother transference, dreams that “she had to get across some deep\nwater (typical idea!) with this friend; her friend fell in (mother\ntransference); she tries to drag her out, and almost succeeds, but a\nlarge crab seizes on the dreamer by the foot and tries to pull her in.”\n\nEtymology also confirms this conception: There is an Indo-Germanic root\n_vélu-_, _vel-_, with the meaning of “encircling, surrounding, turning.”\nFrom this is derived Sanskrit _val_, _valati_ = to cover, to surround,\nto encircle, to encoil (symbol of the snake); _vallî_ = creeping plant;\n_ulûta_ = boa-constrictor = Latin _volûtus_, Lithuanian _velù_, _velti_\n= _wickeln_ (to roll up); Church Slavonian _vlina_ = Old High German,\n_wella_ = _Welle_ (wave or billow). To the root _vélu_ also belongs the\nroot _vlvo_, with the meaning “cover, corium, womb.” (The serpent on\naccount of its casting its skin is an excellent symbol of rebirth.)\nSanskrit _ulva_, _ulba_ has the same meaning; Latin _volva_, _volvula_,\n_vulva_. To _vélu_ also belongs the root _ulvorâ_, with the meaning of\n“fruitful field, covering or husk of plants, sheath.” Sanskrit _urvárâ_\n= sown field. Zend _urvara_ = plant. (See the personification of the\nploughed furrow.) The same root _vel_ has also the meaning of “wallen”\n(to undulate). Sanskrit _ulmuka_ = conflagration. Ϝαλέα, Ϝέλα, Gothic\n_vulan_ = _wallen_ (to undulate). Old High German and Middle High German\n_walm_ = heat, glow.[494] It is typical that in the state of\n“involution” the hair of the sun-hero always falls out from the heat.\nFurther the root _vel_ is found with the meaning “to sound,[495] and to\nwill, to wish” (libido!).",
