From the dismemberment life is pieced together again. (The Medea wonder.) Just as a smith forges the pieces together, so is the dismembered dead again put together. (This comparison is also found in \u201cTimaios\u201d of Plato: the parts of the world joined together with pegs.) In the Rigveda, 10, 72, the creator of the world, Brahmanaspati, is a smith.\u201cBrahmanaspati, as a blacksmith,           Welded the world together.\u201dThe sword has the significance of the phallic sun power; therefore, a sword proceeds from the mouth of the apocalyptic Christ; that is to say, the procreative fire, the word, or the procreative Logos. In Rigveda, Brahmanaspati is also a prayer-word, which possessed an ancient creative significance:[697]\u201cAnd this prayer of the singers, expanding from itself,     Became a cow, which was already there before the world,     Dwelling together in the womb of this god,     Foster-children of the same keeper are the gods.\u201d\u2014_Rigveda_ x: 31.",

    "question": "How is the sword metaphorically linked to phallic and solar concepts, and what does this imply about its source?",
    "answer": "The sword is metaphorically linked to phallic and solar concepts, symbolizing the procreative and life-giving power. This is evident in the idea that a sword emerges from the mouth of the apocalyptic Christ, representing the procreative fire, word, or procreative Logos. This metaphor suggests that the sword, as a symbol of power and creation, originates from a source of life and divine energy.",
