    "paragraph": "This leads into the second fundamental conception, which is perhaps even less considered than the foregoing, and that is the relative value of the conscious mind and thought. It is the general attitude of people to judge themselves by their surface motives, to satisfy themselves by saying or thinking \u201cthis is what I want to do or say\u201d or \u201cI intended to do thus and so,\u201d but somehow what one thought, one intended to say or expected to do is very often the contrary of what actually is said or done. Every one has had these experiences when the gap between the conscious thought and action was gross enough to be observed. It is also a well known experience to consciously desire something very much and when it is obtained to discover that this in no wise satisfied or lessened the desire, which was then transferred to some other object. Thus one became cognizant of the fact that the feeling and idea presented by consciousness as the desire was an error. What is the difficulty in these conditions? Evidently some other directing force than that of which we are aware is at work.",

    "question": "Can you provide an example of the discrepancy between conscious thought and action mentioned in the text?",
    "answer": "Certainly. An example given in the text is when someone consciously desires something very much, but upon obtaining it, they realize that this desire is not fully satisfied. Instead, the desire is transferred to some other object. This experience highlights that the feeling and idea presented by consciousness as the desire might be an error, and there is likely another directing force at work.",
