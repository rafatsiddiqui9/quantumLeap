    "paragraph": "The meaning of the cross is certainly not limited to the tree of life, as has already been shown. Just as the tree of life has also a phallic sub-meaning (as libido symbol), so there is a further significance to the cross than life and immortality.[554] M\u00fcller uses it as a sign of rain and of fertility, because it appears among the Indians distinctly as a magic charm of fertility. It goes without saying, therefore, that it plays a r\u00f4le in the sun cult. It is also noteworthy that the sign of the cross is an important sign for the keeping away of all evil, like the ancient gesture of Manofica. The phallic amulets also serve the same purpose. Z\u00f6ckler appears to have overlooked the fact that the phallic Crux Ansata is the same cross which has flourished in countless examples in the soil of antiquity. Copies of this Crux Ansata are found in many places, and almost every collection of antiquities possesses one or more specimens.[555]Finally, it must be mentioned that the form of the human body is imitated in the cross as of a man with arms outspread. It is remarkable that in early Christian representations Christ is not nailed to the cross, but stands before it with arms outstretched.[556] Maurice[557] gives a striking basis for this interpretation when he says:\u201cIt is a fact not less remarkable than well attested, that the Druids  in their groves were accustomed to select the most stately and  beautiful tree as an emblem of the deity they adored, and cutting off  the side branches, they affixed two of the largest of them to the  highest part of the trunk, in such a manner that those branches  extended on each side like the arms of a man, and together with the  body presented the appearance of a huge cross; and in the bark in  several places was also inscribed the letter \u03a4 (tau).\u201d[558]",

    "question": "What are some of the significances of the cross beyond its symbolism of life and immortality?",
    "answer": "The cross has several significances beyond life and immortality. It is used as a sign of rain and fertility, and it plays a role in the sun cult. Additionally, the cross is an important sign for keeping away evil, similar to the ancient gesture of Manofica. Phallic amulets also serve a similar purpose.",
