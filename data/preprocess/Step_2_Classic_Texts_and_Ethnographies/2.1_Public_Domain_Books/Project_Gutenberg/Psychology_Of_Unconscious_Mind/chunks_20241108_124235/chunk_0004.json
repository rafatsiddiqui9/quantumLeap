  "original_text": "This struggle and conflict gives rise to the unconscious phantasy of\nself-sacrifice which really means the sacrificing of the childish\ntendencies and love type in order to free libido; for his nature demands\nthat he attain the capacity for the accomplishment of his own personal\nfulfilment, the satisfaction of which belongs to the developed man and\nwoman.\n\nThis conception has been worked out in detail by Jung in the book which\nis herein presented to English readers.\n\nWe now come to the most important of Jung’s conceptions in that it bears\npractically upon the treatment of certain types of the neuroses and\nstands theoretically in direct opposition to Freud’s hypothesis. While\nrecognizing fully the influence of the parents and of the sexual\nconstitution of the child, Jung refuses to see in this infantile past\nthe real cause for the later development of the illness. He definitely\nplaces the cause of the pathogenic conflict _in the present moment_ and\nconsiders that in seeking for the cause in the distant past one is only\nfollowing the desire of the patient, which is to withdraw himself as\nmuch as possible from the present important period.\n\nThe conflict is produced by some important task or duty which is\nessential biologically and practically for the fulfilment of the ego of\nthe individual, but before which an obstacle arises from which he\nshrinks, and thus halted cannot go on. With this interference in the\npath of progression libido is stored up and a _regression_ takes place\nwhereby there occurs a reanimation of past ways of libido occupation\nwhich were entirely normal to the child, but which for the adult are no\nlonger of value. These regressive infantile desires and phantasies now\nalive and striving for satisfaction are converted into symptoms, and in\nthese surrogate forms obtain a certain gratification, thus creating the\nexternal manifestations of the neurosis. Therefore Jung does not ask\nfrom what psychic experience or point of fixation in childhood the\npatient is suffering, but what is the present duty or task he is\navoiding, or what obstacle in his life’s path he is unable to overcome?\nWhat is the cause of his regression to past psychic experiences?\n\nFollowing this theory Jung expresses the view that the elaborate\nphantasies and dreams produced by these patients are really forms of\ncompensation or artificial substitutes for the unfulfilled adaptation to\nreality. The sexual content of these phantasies and dreams is only\napparently and not actually expressive of a real sexual desire or incest\nwish, but is a regressive employment of sexual forms to symbolically\nexpress a present-day need when the attainment of the present ego demand\nseems too difficult or impossible, and no adaptation is made to what is\npossible for the individual’s capability.[3]\n\nWith this statement Jung throws a new light on the work of analytic\npsychology and on the conception of the neurotic symptoms, and renders\npossible of understanding the many apparent incongruities and\nconflicting observations which have been so disturbing to the critics.\n\n\nIt now becomes proper to ask what has been established by all this mass\nof investigation into the soul, and what is its value not only as a\ntherapeutic measure for the neurotic sufferer, but also for the normal\nhuman being?\n\nFirst and perhaps most important is the recognition of a definite\npsychological determinism. Instead of human life being filled with\nfoolish, meaningless or purposeless actions, errors and thoughts, it can\nbe demonstrated that no expression or manifestation of the psyche,\nhowever trifling or inconsistent in appearance, is really lawless or\nunmotivated. Only a possession of the technique is necessary in order to\nreveal, to any one desirous of knowing, the existence of the unconscious\ndeterminants of his mannerisms, trivial expressions, acts and behavior,\ntheir purpose and significance.\n\nThis leads into the second fundamental conception, which is perhaps even\nless considered than the foregoing, and that is the relative value of\nthe conscious mind and thought. It is the general attitude of people to\njudge themselves by their surface motives, to satisfy themselves by\nsaying or thinking “this is what I want to do or say” or “I intended to\ndo thus and so,” but somehow what one thought, one intended to say or\nexpected to do is very often the contrary of what actually is said or\ndone. Every one has had these experiences when the gap between the\nconscious thought and action was gross enough to be observed. It is also\na well known experience to consciously desire something very much and\nwhen it is obtained to discover that this in no wise satisfied or\nlessened the desire, which was then transferred to some other object.\nThus one became cognizant of the fact that the feeling and idea\npresented by consciousness as the desire was an error. What is the\ndifficulty in these conditions? Evidently some other directing force\nthan that of which we are aware is at work.\n\nDr. G. Stanley Hall uses a very striking symbol when he compares the\nmind to an iceberg floating in the ocean with one-eighth visible above\nthe water and seven-eighths below—the one-eighth above being that part\ncalled conscious and the seven-eighths below that which we call the\nunconscious. The influence and controlling power of the unconscious\ndesires over our thoughts and acts are in this relative proportion.\nFaint glimmers of other motives and interests than those we accept or\nwhich we believe, often flit into consciousness. These indications, if\nstudied or valued accurately, would lead to the realization that\nconsciousness is but a single stage and but one form of expression of\nmind. Therefore its dictum is but one, often untrustworthy, approach to\nthe great question as to what is man’s actual psychic accomplishment,\nand as to what in particular is the actual soul development of the\nindividual.\n\nA further contribution of equal importance has been the empiric\ndevelopment of a dynamic theory of life; the conception that life is in\na state of flux—movement—leading either to construction or destruction.\nThrough the development man has reached he has attained the power by\nmeans of his intelligence and understanding of definitely directing to a\ncertain extent this life energy or libido into avenues which serve his\ninterest and bring a real satisfaction for the present day.\n\nWhen man through ignorance and certain inherent tendencies fails to\nrecognize his needs or his power to fulfil them, or to adapt himself to\nthe conditions of reality of the present time, there is then produced\nthat reanimation of infantile paths by which an attempt is made to gain\nfulfilment or satisfaction through the production of symptoms or\nattitudes.\n\nThe acceptance of these statements demands the recognition of the\nexistence of an infantile sexuality and the large part played by it in\nthe later life of the individual. Because of the power and imperious\ninfluence exerted by the parents upon the child, and because of the\nunconscious attachment of his libido to the original object, the mother,\nand the perseverance of this first love model in the psyche, he finds it\nvery difficult, on reaching the stage of adult development and the time\nfor seeking a love object outside of the family, to gain a satisfactory\nmodel.\n\nIt is exceedingly important for parents and teachers to recognize the\nrequirements of nature, which, beginning with puberty, imperiously\ndemand of the young individual a separation of himself from the parent\nstem and the development of an independent existence. In our complex\nmodern civilization this demand of nature is difficult enough of\nachievement for the child who has the heartiest and most intelligent\nco-operation of his parents and environment—but for the one who has not\nonly to contend with his own inner struggle for his freedom but has in\naddition the resistance of his parents who would hold him in his\nchildhood at any cost, because they cannot endure the thought of his\nseparation from them, the task becomes one of the greatest magnitude. It\nis during this period when the struggle between the childish inertia and\nnature’s urge becomes so keen, that there occur the striking\nmanifestations of jealousy, criticism, irritability all usually directed\nagainst the parents, of defiance of parental authority, of runaways and\nvarious other psychic and nervous disorders known to all.\n\nThis struggle, which is the first great task of mankind and the one\nwhich requires the greatest effort, is that which is expressed by Jung\nas the self-sacrifice motive—the sacrifice of the childish feelings and\ndemands, and of the irresponsibility of this period, and the assumption\nof the duties and tasks of an individual existence.\n\nIt is this great theme which Jung sees as the real motive lying hidden\nin the myths and religions of man from the beginning, as well as in the\nliterature and artistic creations of both ancient and modern time, and\nwhich he works out with the greatest wealth of detail and painstaking\neffort in the book herewith presented.\n\nThis necessitates a recognition and revaluation of the enormous\nimportance and influence of the ego and the sexual instinct upon the\nthought and reaction of man, and also predicates a displacement of the\npsychological point of gravity from the will and intellect to the realm\nof the emotions and feelings. The desired end is a synthesis of these\ntwo paths or the use of the intellect constructively in the service of\nthe emotions in order to gain for the best interest of the individual\nsome sort of co-operative reaction between the two.\n\nNo one dealing with analytic psychology can fail to be struck by the\ntremendous and unnecessary burdens which man has placed upon himself,\nand how greatly he has increased the difficulties of adaptation by his\nrigid intellectual views and moral formulas, and by his inability to\nadmit to himself that he is actually just a human being imperfect, and\ncontaining within himself all manner of tendencies, good and bad, all\nstriving for some satisfactory goal. Further, that the refusal to see\nhimself in this light instead of as an ideal person in no way alters the\nactual condition, and that in fact, through the cheap pretense of being\nable only to consider himself as a very virtuous person, or as shocked\nand hurt when observing the “sins” of others, he actually is prevented\nfrom developing his own character and bringing his own capacities to\ntheir fullest expressions.\n\nThere is frequently expressed among people the idea of how fortunate it\nis that we cannot see each other’s thoughts, and how disturbing it would\nbe if our real feelings could be read. But what is so shameful in these\nsecrets of the soul? They are in reality our own egoistic desires all\nstriving, longing, wishing for satisfaction, for happiness; those\ndesires which instinctively crave their own gratification but which can\nonly be really fulfilled by adapting them to the real world and to the\nsocial group.\n\nWhy is it that it is so painful for man to admit that the prime\ninfluence in all human endeavor is found in the ego itself, in its\ndesires, wishes, needs and satisfactions, in short, in its need for\nself-expression and self-perpetuation, the evolutionary impetus in life?\n\nThe basis for the unpleasantness of this idea may perhaps be found in an\ninner resistance in nature itself which forces man to include others in\nhis scheme, lest his own greedy desires should serve to destroy him. But\neven with this inner demand and all the ethical and moral teachings of\ncenturies it is everywhere evident that man has only very imperfectly\nlearned that it is to his own interest to consider his neighbor and that\nit is impossible for him to ignore the needs of the body social of which\nhe is a part. Externally, the recognition of the strength of the ego\nimpulse is objectionable because of the ideal conception that\nself-striving and so-called selfish seeking are unworthy, ignoble and\nincompatible with a desirable character and must be ignored at all cost.\n\nThe futility of this attitude is to be clearly seen in the failure after\nall these centuries to even approximate it, as evidenced in our human\nrelations and institutions, and is quite as ineffectual in this realm as\nin that of sexuality where the effort to overcome this imperious\ndomination has been attempted by lowering the instinct, and seeing in it\nsomething vile or unclean, something unspeakable and unholy. Instead of\ndestroying the power of sexuality this struggle has only warped and\ndistorted, injured and mutilated the expression; for not without\ndestruction of the individual can these fundamental instincts be\ndestroyed. Life itself has needs and imperiously demands expression\nthrough the forms created. All nature answers to this freely and simply\nexcept man. His failure to recognize himself as an instrument through\nwhich the life energy is coursing and the demands of which must be\nobeyed, is the cause of his misery. Despite his possession of intellect\nand self-consciousness, he cannot without disaster to himself refuse the\ntasks of life and the fulfilment of his own needs. Man’s great task is\nthe adaptation of himself to reality and the recognition of himself as\nan instrument for the expression of life according to his individual\npossibilities.\n\nIt is in his privilege as a self-creator that his highest purpose is\nfound.\n\nThe value of self-consciousness lies in the fact that man is enabled to\nreflect upon himself and learn to understand the true origin and\nsignificance of his actions and opinions, that he may adequately value\nthe real level of his development and avoid being self-deceived and\ntherefore inhibited from finding his biological adaptation. He need no\nlonger be unconscious of the motives underlying his actions or hide\nhimself behind a changed exterior, in other words, be merely a series of\nreactions to stimuli as the mechanists have it, but he may to a certain\nextent become a self-creating and self-determining being.\n\nIndeed, there seems to be an impulse towards adaptation quite as Bergson\nsees it, and it would seem to be a task of the highest order to use\nintelligence to assist one’s self to work with this impulse.",
