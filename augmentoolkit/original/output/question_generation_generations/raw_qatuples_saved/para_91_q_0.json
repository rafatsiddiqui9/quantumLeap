    "paragraph": "Empusa, like Hecate, has _peculiar_ feet; one foot is made of brass, the other of ass\u2019 dung. Hecate has snakelike feet, which, as in the triple form ascribed to Hecate, points to her phallic libido nature.[721] In Tralles, Hecate appears next to Priapus; there is also a Hecate Aphrodisias. Her symbols are the key,[722] the whip,[723] the snake,[724] the dagger[725] and the torch.[726] As mother of death, dogs accompany her, the significance of which we have previously discussed at length. As guardian of the door of Hades and as Goddess of dogs, she is of threefold form, and really identified with Cerberus. Thus Hercules, in bringing up Cerberus, brings the conquered mother of death into the upper world. As spirit mother (moon!), she sends madness, lunacy. (This mythical observation states that \u201cthe mother\u201d sends madness; by far the majority of the cases of insanity consist, in fact, in the domination of the individual by the material of the incest phantasy.) In the mysteries of Cerberus, a rod, called \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2,[727] was broken off. This rod protected the purity of virgins, and caused any one who touched the plant to become insane. We recognize in this the motive of the sacred tree, which, as mother, must not be touched, an act which only an insane person would commit. Hecate, as nightmare, appears in the form of Empusa, in a vampire r\u00f4le, or as Lamia, as devourer of men; perhaps, also, in that more beautiful guise, \u201cThe Bride of Corinth.\u201d She is the mother of all charms and witches, the patron of Medea, because the power of the \u201cterrible mother\u201d is magical and irresistible (working upward from the unconscious). In Greek syncretism, she plays a very significant r\u00f4le. She is confused with Artemis, who also has the surname \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7,[728] \u201cthe one striking at a distance\u201d or \u201cstriking according to her will,\u201d in which we recognize again her superior power. Artemis is the huntress, ",

    "question": "What is unique about Empusa and Hecate's feet, and what does this suggest about Hecate's nature?",
    "answer": "Empusa and Hecate both have peculiar feet. Empusa has one foot made of brass and the other of ass' dung, while Hecate has snakelike feet. The snakelike feet of Hecate point to her phallic libido nature, suggesting that she is associated with sexual energy and fertility.",
