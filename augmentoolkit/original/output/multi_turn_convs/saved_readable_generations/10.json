My nest is not seen and my egg is not broken.”A further passage reads:“that great and noble god in his egg: who is his own originator of  that which has arisen from him.”[532]Therefore, the god Nagaga-uer is also called the “great cackler.” (Book of the Dead.) “I cackle like a goose and I whistle like a falcon.” The mother is reproached with the incest prohibition as an act of wilful maliciousness by which she excludes the son from immortality.
