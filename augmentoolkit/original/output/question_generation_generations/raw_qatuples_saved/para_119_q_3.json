    "paragraph": "We have already seen that, according to Egyptian conceptions, Isis, the mother of god, played an evil trick on the sun-god with the poisonous snake; also Isis behaved treacherously toward her son Horus in Plutarch\u2019s tradition. That is, Horus vanquished the evil Typhon, who murdered Osiris treacherously (terrible mother = Typhon). Isis, _however, set him free again_. Horus thereupon rebelled, _laid hands on his mother and tore the regal ornaments from her head_, whereupon Hermes gave her a cow\u2019s head. Then Horus conquered Typhon a second time. Typhon, in the Greek legend, is a monstrous dragon. Even without this confirmation it is evident that the battle of Horus is the typical battle of the sun-hero with the whale-dragon. Of the latter we know that it is a symbol of the \u201cdreadful mother,\u201d of the voracious jaws of death, where men are dismembered and ground up.[526] Whoever vanquishes this monster has gained a new or eternal youth. For this purpose one must, in spite of all dangers, descend into the belly of the monster[527] (journey to hell) and spend some time there. (Imprisonment by night in the sea.)",

    "question": "What is the symbolic meaning of the battles between Horus and Typhon, and the journey into the belly of the monster?",
    "answer": "The battles between Horus and Typhon symbolize the typical battle of the sun-hero with the whale-dragon, which is a symbol of the \"dreadful mother\" and the voracious jaws of death. To gain new or eternal youth, one must descend into the belly of the monster and spend time there, a journey that represents a descent into hell or a symbolic death and rebirth. This journey is a crucial part of the narrative, highlighting the transformative nature of these battles and the eventual triumph over the forces of destruction.",
