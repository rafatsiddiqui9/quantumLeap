The dawn is truly the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun his\n  eye, the wind his breath, his mouth the all-spreading fire, the year\n  is the body of the sacrificial horse. The sky is his back, the\n  atmosphere his body cavity, the earth the vault of his belly, the\n  poles are his sides, the space between the poles his ribs, the seasons\n  his limbs, the months and half-months his joints, day and night his\n  feet, the stars his bones, the clouds his flesh, the food, which he\n  digests, are the deserts; the rivers, his veins; liver and lungs, the\n  mountains; the herbs and trees, his hair; the rising sun is his\n  forepart, the setting sun his hind-part. When he shows his teeth, that\n  is lightning; when he trembles, that is thunder; when he urinates,\n  that is rain; his voice is speech.\n\n  “2. The day, in truth, has originated for the horse as the sacrificial\n  dish, which stands before him; his cradle is in the world-sea towards\n  the East; the night has originated for him as the sacrificial dish,\n  which stands behind him; its cradle is in the world-sea of the\n  evening; these two dishes originated in order to surround the horse.\n  As a charger he generated the gods, as champion he produced the\n  Gandharvas, as a racer the demons, as horse mankind. The Ocean is his\n  relative, the ocean his cradle.”\n\nAs Deussen remarks, the sacrificial horse has the significance of a\n_renunciation of the universe_. When the horse is sacrificed, then the\nworld is sacrificed and destroyed, as it were—a train of thought which\nSchopenhauer also had in mind, and which appears as a product of a\ndiseased mind in Schreber.[816] The horse in the above text stands\nbetween two sacrificial vessels, from one of which it comes and to the\nother of which it goes, just as the sun passes from morning to evening.\nThe horse, therefore, signifies the libido, which has passed into the\nworld. We previously saw that the “mother libido” must be sacrificed in\norder to produce the world; here the world is destroyed by the repeated\nsacrifice of the same libido, which once belonged to the mother. The\nhorse can, therefore, be substituted as a symbol for this libido,\nbecause, as we saw, it had manifold connections with the mother.[817]\nThe sacrifice of the horse can only produce another state of\nintroversion, which is similar to that before the creation of the world.\nThe position of the horse between the two vessels, which represent the\nproducing and the devouring mother, hint at the idea of life enclosed in\nthe ovum; therefore, the vessels are destined to “surround” the horse.\nThat this is actually so the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 3: 3 proves:\n\n  “1. From where have the descendants of Parikshit come, that I ask\n  thee, Yâjñavalkya! From where came the descendants of Parikshit?\n\n  “2. Yâjñavalkya spake: ‘He has told thee, they have come from where\n  all come, who offer up the sacrificial horse. That is to say, this\n  world extends so far as two and thirty days of the chariot of the Gods\n  (the sun) reach. This (world) surrounds the earth twice around. This\n  earth surrounds the ocean twice around. There is, as broad as the edge\n  of a razor or as the wing of a fly, a space between (the two shells of\n  the egg of the world). These were brought by Indra as a falcon to the\n  wind: and the wind took them up into itself and carried them where\n  were the offerers of the sacrificial horse. Somewhat like this he\n  spoke (Gandharva to thee) and praised the wind.’\n\n  “Therefore is the wind the special (vyashti) and the wind the\n  universal (samashti). He, who knows this, defends himself from dying\n  again.”\n\nAs this text tells us, the offerers of the sacrificial horse come in\nthat _narrowest fissure_ between the shells of the egg of the world, at\nthat place, where the shells _unite and where they are divided_. The\nfissure (_vagina_) in the maternal world soul is designated by Plato in\n“Timaeus” by Χ, the symbol of the cross. Indra, who as a falcon has\nstolen the soma (the treasure attainable with difficulty), brings, as\nPsychopompos, the souls to the wind, to the generating pneuma, which\ncarries them forward to the fissure or vagina, to the point of union, to\nthe entrance into the maternal egg. This train of thought of the Hindoo\nphilosophy briefly and concisely summarizes the sense of innumerable\nmyths; at the same time it is a striking example of the fact that\nphilosophy is internally nothing else but a refined and sublimated\nmythology. It is brought to this refined state by the influence of the\ncorrector of reality.[818] We have emphasized the fact that in the\nMiller drama the horse is the first to die, as the animal brother of the\nhero. (Corresponding to the early death of the half-animal Eabani, the\nbrother friend of Gilgamesh.) This sacrificial death recalls the whole\ncategory of mythological animal sacrifices. Volumes could be filled with\nparallels, but we must limit ourselves here to suggestions. The\nsacrificial animal, where it has lost the primitive meaning of the\nsimple sacrificial gift, and has taken a higher religious significance,\nstands in a close relation to both the hero and the divinity. The animal\nrepresents the god himself;[819] thus the bull[820] represents Zagreus,\nDionysus and Mithra; the lamb represents Christ,[821] etc. As we are\naware, the animal symbols represent the animal libido. The sacrifice of\nthe animal means, therefore, the sacrifice of the animal nature. This is\nmost clearly expressed in the religious legend of Attis. Attis is the\nson lover of the divine mother, Agdistis Cybele. Agdistis was\ncharacteristically androgynous,[822] as symbol of the mother-libido,\nlike the tree; really a clear indication that the mother-imago has in\naddition to the significance of the likeness of the real mother the\nmeaning of the mother of humanity, the libido in general. Driven mad by\nthe insanity-breeding mother enamored of him, he emasculates himself,\nand that under a pine tree. (The pine tree plays an important rôle in\nhis service. Every year a pine tree was wreathed about and upon it an\nimage of Attis was hung, and then it was cut down, which represents the\ncastration.) The blood, which spurted to the earth, was transformed into\nbudding violets. Cybele now took this pine tree, bore it into her cavern\nand there wept over it. (Pietà.) The chthonic mother takes her son with\nher into the cavern—namely, into the womb—according to another version.\nAttis was transformed into the pine tree. The tree here has an\nessentially phallic meaning; on the contrary, the attaching of the image\nof Attis to the tree refers also to the maternal meaning. (“To be\nattached to the mother.”) In Ovid (“Metamorphoses,” Book X) the pine\ntree is spoken of as follows:\n\n           “Grata deum matri, siquidem Cybeleius Attis\n           Exuit hac hominem, truncoque induruit illo.”[823]\n\nThe transformation into the pine tree is evidently a burial in the\nmother, just as Osiris was overgrown by the heather. Upon the Attis\nbas-relief of Coblenz Attis appears _growing out of a tree_, which is\ninterpreted by Mannhardt as the “life-principle” of vegetation inherent\nin the tree. It is probably a tree birth, just as with Mithra. (Relief\nof Heddernheim.) As Firmicus observes, in the Isis and Osiris cult and\nalso in the cult of the virgin Persephone, tree and image had played a\nrôle.[824] Dionysus had the surname Dendrites, and in Boeotia he is said\nto have been called ἔνδενδρος, meaning “in a tree.” (At the birth of\nDionysus, Megaira planted the pine tree on the Kithairon.) The Pentheus\nmyth bound up with the Dionysus legend furnishes the remarkable and\nsupplementary counterpart to the death of Attis, and the subsequent\nlamentation. Pentheus,[825] curious to espy the orgies of the Maenades,\n_climbed upon a pine tree_, but he was observed by his mother; the\nMaenades cut down the tree, and Pentheus, taken for an animal, was torn\nby them in frenzy,[826] his own mother being the first to rush upon him.\nIn this myth the phallic meaning of the tree (cutting down, castration)\nand its maternal significance (mounting and the sacrificial death of the\nson) is present; at the same time the supplementary counterpart to the\nPietà is apparent, the “terrible mother.” The feast of Attis was\ncelebrated as a lamentation and then as a joy in the spring. (Good\nFriday and Easter.) The priests of Attis-Cybele worship were often\neunuchs, and were called Galloi.[827] The archigallus was called Atys\n(Attis).[828] Instead of the animal castration, the priests merely\nscratched their arms until they bled. (Arm in place of phallus, “the\ntwisting of arms.”) A similar symbolism of the sacrificial impulse is\nmet in the Mithraic religion, where essential parts of the mysteries\nconsist in the catching and the subduing of the bull.\n\nA parallel figure to Mithra is the primitive man Gayomard. He was\ncreated together with his bull, and the two lived for six thousand years\nin a blissful state. But when the world came into the cycle of the\nseventh sign of the Zodiac (Libra) the evil principle entered. Libra is\nastrologically the so-called positive domicile of Venus; the evil\nprinciple, therefore, came under the dominion of the goddess of love\n(destruction of the sun-hero through the mother-wife—snake, whore, etc).\nAs a result, after thirty years, Gayomard and his bull died. (The trials\nof Zartusht lasted also thirty years; compare the span of Christ’s\nlife.) Fifty-five species of grain came from the dead bull, twelve kinds\nof salubrious plants, etc. The sperma of the bull entered into the moon\nfor purification, but the sperma of Gayomard entered into the sun. This\ncircumstance possibly suggests a rather feminine meaning of bull. Gosh\nor Drvâçpa is the soul of the bull, and was worshipped as a female\ndivinity. She would not, at first, from diffidence, become the goddess\nof the herds, until the coming of Zarathustra was announced to her as\nconsolation. This has its parallel in the Hindoo Purâna, where the\ncoming of Krishna was promised the earth. (A complete analogy to\nChrist.[829]) She, too, travels in her chariot, like Ardvîçûra, the\ngoddess of love. The soul of the bull is, therefore, decidedly feminine.\nThis myth of Gayomard repeats only in an altered form the primitive\nconception of the closed ring of a male-female divinity, self-begetting\nand forth-bringing.\n\nLike the sacrificial bull, the fire, the sacrifice of which we have\nalready discussed in Chapter III, has a feminine nature among the\nChinese, according to the commentaries[830] of the philosopher\nTschwang-Tse:\n\n  “The spirit of the hearth is called Ki. He is clad in bright red,\n  which resembles fire, and appears as a lovely, attractive maiden.”\n\nIn the “Book of Rites” it is said:\n\n  “Wood is burned in the flames for the spirit of Au. This sacrifice to\n  Au is a sacrifice to old departed women.”\n\nThese spirits of the hearth and fire are the souls of departed cooks\nand, therefore, are called “old women.” The kitchen god develops from\nthis pre-Buddhistic tradition and becomes later (male sex) the ruler of\nthe family and the _mediator between family and god_. Thus the old\nfeminine fire spirit becomes a species of Logos. (Compare with this the\nremarks in Chapter III.)",
