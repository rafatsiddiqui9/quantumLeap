    \ process for life on Earth. It involves the conversion of light energy into chemical\
    \ energy, which is stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts,\
    \ specifically within a pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of\
    \ two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions,\
    \ also known as the Calvin cycle. During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight\
    \ is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then converts water (H2O) into oxygen (O2)\
    \ and transfers energy to the light-independent reactions. The Calvin cycle uses\
    \ this energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into glucose,\
    \ a simple sugar.\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text): \"\"\"Explain exactly why\

    \ the fourth year, is, at the same time, considered externally, the period when\
    \ the child finds himself confronted with increased demands from the world of\
    \ reality. He can walk, speak and independently attend to a number of other things.\
    \ He sees himself in a relation to a world of unlimited possibilities, but in\
    \ which he dares to do little or nothing, because he is as yet too much of a baby\
    \ and cannot get on without his mother. At this time mother should be exchanged\
    \ for the world. Against this the past rises as the greatest resistance; this\
    \ is always so whenever man would undertake a new adaptation. In spite of all\
    \ evidence and against all conscious resolutions, the unconscious (the past) always\
    \ enforces its standpoint as resistance. In this difficult position, precisely\
    \ at this period of developing sexuality, we see the dawning of the mind. The\
    \ problem of the child at this period is the discovery of the world and of the\
    \ great transsubjective reality. For that he must lose the mother; every step\
    \ out into the world means a step away from the mother. Naturally, all that which\
    \ is retrogressive in men rebels against this step, and energetic attempts are\
    \ made against this adaptation in the first place. Therefore, this period of life\
    \ is also that in which the first clearly developed neuroses arise. The tendency\
    \ of this age is one directly opposed to that of dementia præcox. The child seeks\
    \ to win the world and to leave the mother (this is a necessary result). The dementia\
    \ præcox patient, however, seeks to leave the world and to regain the subjectivity\
    \ of childhood. We have seen that in dementia præcox the recent adaptation to\
    \ reality is replaced by an archaic mode of adaptation; that is to say, the recent\
    \ idea of the world is rejected in favor of an archaic idea of the world. When\
