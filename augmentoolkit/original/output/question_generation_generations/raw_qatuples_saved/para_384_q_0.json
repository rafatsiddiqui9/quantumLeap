    "paragraph": "_Second_, the suppressed effect creates compensations elsewhere. For example, people who strive for excessive ethics, who try always to think, feel, and act altruistically and ideally, avenge themselves, because of the impossibility of carrying out their ideals, by subtle maliciousness, which naturally does not come into their own consciousness as such, but which leads to misunderstandings and unhappy situations. Apparently, then, all of these are only \u201cespecially unfortunate circumstances,\u201d or they are the guilt and malice of other people, or they are tragic complications.One is, indeed, freed of the conscious conflict, nevertheless it lies invisible at one\u2019s feet, and is stumbled over at every step. The technic of the apparent suppressing and forgetting is inadequate because it is not possible of achievement in the last analysis\u2014it is in reality a mere makeshift. The religious projection offers a much more effectual help. In this one keeps the conflict in sight (care, pain, anxiety, and so on) and gives it over to a personality standing outside of one\u2019s self, the Divinity. The evangelical command teaches us this:\u201cCast all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.\u201d\u2014_I Peter_  v: 7.\u201cIn nothing be anxious; but in every thing by prayer and  supplication ... let your requests be made known unto God.\u201d\u2014_Phil._  iv: 6.This is emphasized as especially important in order to preserve society upright through mutual love (Transference); the Pauline writings leave no doubt about this:\u201cThrough love be servants one to another.\u201d\u2014_Gal._ v: 13.\u201cLet love of the brethren continue.\u201d\u2014_Heb._ xiii: 1.\u201cAnd let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works.  Not forgetting our own assembling together as is the custom of some,  but exhorting one another.\u201d\u2014_Heb._ x: 24\u201325.",

    "answer": "A potential consequence for individuals who strive to always act altruistically and ideally is that they may unconsciously adopt subtle maliciousness as a form of vengeful behavior due to the impossibility of fully realizing their ideals. This subtle maliciousness leads to misunderstandings and unhappy situations, even though it is not consciously recognized as such.",
