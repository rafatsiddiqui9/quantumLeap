    "paragraph": "But this does not mean to say that this unconscious way of transformation of the incest wish into religious exercises is the only one or the only possible one. There is also a conscious recognition and understanding with which we can take possession of this libido which is bound up in incest and transformed into religious exercises so that we no longer need the stage of religious symbolism for this end. It is thinkable that instead of doing good to our fellow-men, for \u201cthe love of Christ,\u201d we do it from the knowledge that humanity, even as ourselves, could not exist if, among the herd, the one could not sacrifice himself for the other. _This would be the course of moral autonomy, of perfect freedom, when man could without compulsion wish that which he must do, and this from knowledge, without delusion through belief in the religious symbols._It is a positive creed which keeps us infantile and, therefore, ethically inferior. Although of the greatest significance from the cultural point of view and of imperishable beauty from the \u00e6sthetic standpoint, this delusion can no longer ethically suffice humanity striving after moral autonomy.The infantile and moral danger lies in belief in the symbol because through that we guide the libido to an imaginary reality. The simple negation of the symbol changes nothing, for the entire mental disposition remains the same; we merely remove the dangerous object. But the object is not dangerous; the danger is our own infantile mental state, for love of which we have lost something very beautiful and ingenious through the simple abandonment of the religious symbol. I think _belief should be replaced by understanding_; then we would keep the beauty of the symbol, but still remain free from the depressing results of submission to belief. This would be the psychoanalytic cure for belief and disbelief.",

    "question": "What is the concept of \"moral autonomy,\" and how does it relate to the transformation of libido bound to incest?",
    "answer": "Moral autonomy refers to a state where individuals can wish what they must do without compulsion, and they do so from knowledge, without the delusion of belief in religious symbols. It is a concept that suggests true freedom and ethical maturity can be achieved when individuals act based on knowledge rather than religious belief, thereby transforming the libido bound to incest into actions grounded in understanding and ethical responsibility.",
