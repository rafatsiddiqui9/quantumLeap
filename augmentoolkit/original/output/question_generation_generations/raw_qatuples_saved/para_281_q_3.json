    "paragraph": "I am indebted to Freud for a further important reference to the onanistic nature of the fire theft, or rather the motive of _the treasure difficult of attainment_ (to which fire theft belongs). Mythology contains repeated formulas which read approximately as follows: The treasure must be plucked or torn off from a taboo tree (Paradise tree, Hesperides); this is a forbidden and dangerous act. The clearest example of this is the old barbaric custom in the service of Diana of Aricia: only he can become a priest of the goddess who, in her sacred grove, dares to tear off (\u201cabzureissen\u201d) a bough. The tearing off has been retained in vulgar speech (besides \u201cabreiben,\u201d rubbing) as a symbol of the act of onanism. Thus \u201creiben,\u201d to rub, is like \u201creissen,\u201d to break off, both of which are contained in manthami and united apparently only through the myth of the fire theft bound up in the act of onanism in a deeper stratum wherein \u201creiben,\u201d properly speaking, \u201creissen,\u201d is employed, but in a transferred sense. Therefore, it might perhaps be anticipated that in the deepest stratum, namely, the incestuous, which precedes the autoerotic stage,[340] the two meanings coincide, which, through lack of mythological tradition, can perhaps be traced through etymology only.CHAPTER IV          THE UNCONSCIOUS ORIGIN OF THE HERO",

    "question": "What is Freud's hypothesis about the deepest stratum of onanism in relation to incest and autoeroticism?",
    "answer": "Freud hypothesizes that in the deepest stratum, which is the incestuous stage that precedes the autoerotic stage, the meanings of \"reiben\" (to rub) and \"reissen\" (to break off) might coincide. This hypothesis is based on the idea that through the myth of the fire theft, the two meanings are united, and this connection can be traced through etymology even when there is a lack of mythological tradition.",
