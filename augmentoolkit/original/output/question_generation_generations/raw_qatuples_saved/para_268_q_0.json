The Hindoo text mentioned above includes still more\u2014its symbol of the horse contains the whole world; his kinsman and his cradle is the sea, the mother, similar to the world soul, the maternal significance of which we have seen above. Just as Aion represents the libido in an embrace, that is to say, in the state of death and of rebirth, so here the cradle of the horse is the sea, i. e. the libido is in the mother, dying and rising again, like the symbol of the dying and resurrected Christ, who hangs like ripe fruit upon the tree of life.",

    "answer": "Philo of Alexandria suggests that time is perceived differently by different types of people. For pessimistic people, time is seen as a tool for the God who wants to hide the essential nature of existence. For wise and good people, it is not time itself but God who is the focus.",
