    "paragraph": "In this conception of Jung will be seen an analogy to Bergson, who speaks of \u201cthis change, this movement and becoming, this self-creation, call it what you will, as the very stuff and reality of our being.\u201d[2]In developing the energic conception of libido and separating it from Freud\u2019s sexual definition, Jung makes possible the explanation of interest in general, and provides a working concept by which not only the specifically sexual, but the general activities and reactions of man can be understood.If a person complains of no longer having interest in his work or of losing interest in his surroundings, then one understands that his libido is withdrawn from this object and that in consequence the object itself seems no longer attractive, whereas, as a matter of fact, the object itself is exactly the same as formerly. In other words, it is the libido that we bestow upon an object that makes it attractive and interesting.The causes for the withdrawal of libido may be various and are usually quite different from those that the persons offer in explanation. It is the task of psychoanalysis to discover the real reasons, which are usually hidden and unknown. On the other hand, when an individual exhibits an exaggerated interest or places an over-emphasis upon an idea or situation, then we know there is too much libido here and that we may find as a consequence a corresponding depletion elsewhere.This leads directly into the second point of difference between Jung\u2019s views and those of Freud. This is concerned with those practically universal childish manifestations of sexuality called by Freud \u201cpolymorphous perverse\u201d because of their similarity to those abnormalities of sexuality which occur in adults and are called perversions.",

    "question": "How does Jung's conception of libido differ from Freud's, and what does this allow for in psychological understanding?",
    "answer": "Jung's conception of libido separates it from Freud's sexual definition, allowing for a broader explanation of interest and activities in general. This means that Jung\u2019s theory can be applied not only to specifically sexual interests but also to a wide range of human activities and reactions, providing a more comprehensive working concept for understanding human behavior.",
