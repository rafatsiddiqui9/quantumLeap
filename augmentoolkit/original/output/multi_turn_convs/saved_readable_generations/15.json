In which specific passage is speech and fire said to be an emanation of the inner light from which the Atman, the creating psychic force or libido, is known, and how are they described in relation to the Atman?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAh, I see. In the passage you're referring to, speech and fire are indeed said to be an emanation of the inner light from which the Atman, the creating psychic force or libido, is known. Speech itself is called a \"light\" and is reduced to the light of the Atman. This illuminates the connection between these elements and the Atman itself.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this passage or the concepts mentioned?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. What is the significance of the root _bhâ_ in relation to speech and fire, and how is it demonstrated through various languages?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The root _bhâ_ is significant because it designates both \"to lighten, to shine\" and \"to speak.\" This dual meaning is quite fascinating and shows how closely language and light were intertwined in ancient thought. \n\nHere are a few languages that demonstrate this:\n- In Greek, the root is seen in φάω (bāō), φαίνω (phainō), and φάος (phās), which can mean to lighten/shine, to show, and light/beam, respectively.\n- In Sanskrit, the root is _bhan_ (to speak).\n- In Armenian, the root is _ban_ (word).\n- In New High German, the root is seen in _bann_ (to banish), which can also indicate a bright or shining light.\n- In Latin, the root is _fâ-ri_, _fânum_, which can relate to speaking and shining/brightness.\n\nDo you have any other queries about this or any other aspects of the passage?\n\n**User:**\nAccording to the passage, what serves as light for a person when the sun, moon, and fire are no longer available?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the passage, when the sun, moon, and fire are no longer available, speech serves as light for a person. By the light of speech, one sits, moves, carries on work, and returns home. This highlights the importance of language in providing guidance and illumination even in the absence of natural light sources.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this passage or the concepts discussed?\n\n**User:**\nIn this passage, what happens when the sun, moon, fire, and speech are no longer available, and what new source of light does the person rely on?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen the sun, moon, fire, and speech are no longer available, a person relies on himself (Atman) as light. By the light of himself, one sits, moves, carries on work, and returns home. This shows that the Atman itself becomes the ultimate source of light and guidance when all other external sources are unavailable.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to explore or any other questions you have about this passage?"}
